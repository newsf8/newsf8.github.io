<p><strong>Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal Movie Synopsis:</strong> Two cons fall in love and decide to mend his way and settle down with their girlfriends. But a couple of curve balls, one in the form of a determined cop, are just waiting in store.</p>
<p><strong>Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal Movie Review:</strong> Siddharth (Dulquer Salmaan), a techie, is trying to woo Meera (Ritu Varma), a typical girl next door. Egged on by his friend and roommate Kallis (Rakshan), he managed to propose to her. And she accepts! Kallis, too, gets into a relationship with Meera&rsquo;s friend Shreya (Niranjani Ahathiyan). Things are going good, and Siddharth and Kallis, who are scamsters, decide to turn over a new leaf and settle down in Goa with their girlfriends. Meanwhile, Prathap Chakravarthi (Gautham Vasudev Menon), a cop who has been personally affected by their crimes, is determined to nab them.</p>
<p>Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal is a winsome romantic thriller with charming leads and edge-of-the-seat moments. Desingh Periyasamy displays a flair for this material both in his writing and making. Though his premise isn&rsquo;t new, he manages to inject freshness into the scenes with clever writing. Take Kallis. He initially seems like just another wisecracking friend that we come across in our films, but the director gradually turns him into a parallel lead who is used to effectively lighten up the heavier scenes. Even a breakdown scene of this character is filled with the right amount of humour to ensure that things don&rsquo;t turn too serious.</p>
<p>And when the film turns into a proper heist movie in the second half, the shift feels seamless. The heist portions, too, have the right amount of thrills and laughs. The technical team ensures that the breezy mood sustains. Masala Coffee and Harshvardhan Rameshwar&rsquo;s songs and score are peppy while KM Bhaskaran provides the richness that the script deserves with his visuals. In fact, the longer running time doesn&rsquo;t feel like an issue at all here, though the first 15-20 minutes are rather underwhelming.</p>
<p>The director also doesn&rsquo;t try too hard to make us love his characters, and instead lets his actors do the magic. In Dulquer and Ritu, he has actors who can effortlessly be endearing and the two stars, are in such fine form here. But it is Gautham Vasudev Menon who turns out to be Desingh&rsquo;s trump card. The director&rsquo;s characterisation feels like a nod to the heroes in his own films, but it is only in the end, when we get a hilarious self-referential scene that delivers the film&rsquo;s biggest laughs, that we realise how well Desingh has played us with this character.</p>

<p>When was the last time you caught a seamless Tamil romantic comedy with some original humour? Directed by Desingh Periyasamy, Dulquer Salmaan’s 25th film Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal is a winner. The film opens with an aerial view of Chennai. You get a glimpse into the lives of Siddharth (Dulquer Salmaan) and Kallis (Rakshan). You are shown how these two cyber con artists make quick money, masquerading as app developers.</p>

<p>Siddharth is head over heels in love with Meera (Ritu Varma). After stalking her for a couple of months, Siddharth proposes to Meera in a park. Siddharth thinks Meera is a beautician; whereas she is not. Meera doesn’t know the real identity of Siddharth. Siddharth decides to put an end to everything and wants to settle down with Meera. This is where it gets “tricky”. (I liked the meet-cute and the courtship, though.) Meera is a sweet-looking woman, but she is not what she is. As a debutant filmmaker, Desingh Periyasamy keeps you hooked with key plot twists, which is no mean feat.</p>
<p>The first half of the story travels at a slow pace, but the film gets quite interesting in the second half with its focus on the easy camaraderie that the lead characters share. By this time, Siddharth understands who Meera is. He becomes familiar with Meera’s ‘antics’. It is at this point that Ritu Varma completely takes off on her own. You wouldn’t have expected such a twist, post-intermission. This is an example of a very focused narrative. As an audience, say, you expect this is how the film will travel, no, the film takes a different route. It’s tempting to turn a script like Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal into a full-blown comedy, and Desingh Periyasamy doesn’t do that. His film does something very necessary, without waving a flag at your face. Portions that even deal with the nitty-gritty of modern technology is entertaining. This is where it scores.</p>
<p>Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal has got an excellent ensemble of actors who light up the screen, including director Gautham Vasudev Menon, who delivers a stunning performance as Deputy Commissioner of Police, Prathap Chakravarthy. The big twist in the end, involving Gautham Menon’s character, is one you might see coming—I did, from a mile away—but the scene cracks you up when it arrives. In perhaps the filmiest of scenes, Gautham’s character and Ritu Varma’s character talk to each other like Karthik and Jessie of Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya! (This is a spoiler, hey, but that’s all right). Oh, yes, the theater was roaring with laughter. As a showreel of Gautham Menon’s acting chops, Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal gets a thumbs up.</p>
<p>The film rides on clever writing and performances. Some of the funniest moments of Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal are those that involve Dulquer Salmaan and Rakshan. It is a performance-driven film, and the script gives both the actors many moments to shine, tapping into their sharp comic timing.</p>
<p>It is hard to take your eyes off Dulquer Salmaan. If we look beyond his box office pull, it is his energy, screen presence and earnest approach to acting that takes the cake in Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal.</p>
<p>I am curious how this one will perform at the box-office because even after its delayed release, the content is refreshing and panders to the taste of today’s audience. Barring a few scenes (It is not easy to write comedy without malice), Rakshan is funny, and his chemistry with Dulquer is a treat to watch. Ritu Varma, in an impactful role, is extremely graceful and makes her presence felt. Her characterisation is multilayered as is Dulquer Salmaan’s. Spot on casting by Desingh Periyasamy! Harshavardhan Rameshwar’s music cuts no new boundaries but fits well in the narrative.
