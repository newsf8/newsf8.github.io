<p>The saddest thing is that his 13 year old daughter died too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry for kobe and his kid&hellip; However, let&rsquo;s not forget the others who perished</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t wanna be rude but every body’s talking about Kobe and aren’t talking about the other families in the helicopter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of saying ”Kobe” We should say ”For Kobe”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Kobe Bryant died” just doesn’t sound right, it’s not something we needed to hear this soon. I’m so sad😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now the word &ldquo;Kobe&rdquo; gonna hit different when shooting hoops&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before: every time shooting something &ldquo;kobe&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now:every time shooting something &ldquo;for kobe&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MAMBA OUT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A family died in that crash leaving a 16 yr old girl with her grandparents they say they don&rsquo;t know what to do with her as she is broken because she lost her mum dad and little sister😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of shooting a ball and saying &ldquo;Kobe&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;For Kobe&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe and his daughter were found hugging in their last moments, they died hugging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who were the others? I get RIP Kobe and daughter, but only talking about them is like insulting the other causalities :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in shock I can&rsquo;t believe this is real RIP Kobe, GIGI and everyone else who didn&rsquo;t survive this is so tragic. My thoughts and prayers are with their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nicest thing kanye ever said about someone big respects to kanye and rip to a legend the mamba kobe no body will ever take you place ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻 #1 for ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe probably tried his hardest to protect Gigi in those last seconds&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe, Gianna, and all the individuals who perish in that devastating crash.  Sending my prayers and deepest condolences to the families of all the victims!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its crazy he held his daughter 13 years ago and now after 13 years they have died together😔 Rest in peace angels

<p>When you send &ldquo;thought and prayers&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not just the THOUGHT of prayer. You need to talk to God and pray that everyone involved is welcomed in to God&rsquo;s kingdom and that his friends and family find the strength to continue on. 🙏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe was a legend let&rsquo;s never forget him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m in pain I have been crying for a day now I didn’t go to school either prayers going to the family and other victims family’s 💔💔💔😞😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine just seeing him then a while later, the news are exploding about Kobe’s death. And you just saw him 😢😦</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be refreshing if just one so called &lsquo;Celeb&rsquo; when asked said something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for his family but apart from that, I didn&rsquo;t personally know the bloke nor am I a Basketball fan&rdquo; Instead of lining up to comment as if he was their best friend or something. Hypocrisy and falsehood, that&rsquo;s the entertainment business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well 2020 started with a bad thing, Kobe, his daughter and the seven others died. Kobe was a legend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This breaks my heart! Who also agrees that 2020 has gone horribly so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe his daughter and all the others in the crash.  Also Prayers with the families!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe was genius. That is why so many are heartbroken. 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We miss you Kobe Bryant Every 1 has so much questions of how you died we miss you Kobe Bryant you make me cry to know that you died R.I.P Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone was talking about it in class. I was like wtf and when I came home my heart broke. 🖤🖤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its a pissing contest with celebs to see who can look the most affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This prove that we can&rsquo;t guarantee the tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest In Peace Kobe Bryant aka The Mamba and his daughter Gianna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your memory lives on forever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✊✊✊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe, Gianna, and all the victims. My thoughts and prayers  and condolences to all the families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Only the good die young&hellip;&rdquo; more and more true all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Mamba out.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its not Kobe anymore, its For Kobe.

<p>I can’t imagine how Kobe felt when her daughter was so scared and all he could’ve done was hugged her so tightly telling her everything is going to be alright and that he loves her 💔😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She doesn’t even watch basketball, she doesn’t care 🤣🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My school respects him so what we did is scream KOBE   to respect him. 😢

<p>Juice wrld in December 2019 now Kobe 1978-2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember the day after this in school I didn’t even know until my friend hugged me and walked away I didn’t know what happened until my teacher said that Kobe died as did his daughter and seven others. I was in shock and kept waiting for someone to tell me it was all a big joke rip to the victims</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:29 I think that was meant to be a reference to the US Office meme. A tweet of levity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From now on we are now gonna say &ldquo;for kobe&rdquo;. Oh my gosh this broke my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LEGENDS NEVER DIE !!! 🙏</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe Bryant shocked 2020🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That poor mother.. Oh my god. Im at loss for words</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve always wanted to meet kobe Bryant 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe has wings now reach up high kobe and hit the high duni</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wanted Kobe to grow old with us and in another 30years he be the cute old legend like Kareem..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sad ..🌅 RIP Kobe Bryant 🌅 you touched the whole world and that&rsquo;s the difference between you and MJ.. please God help the Bryant family 🕊️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone hating on Billie because she’s young, successful, and didn’t know what to say in the immediate aftermath of a series of tragic deaths? While everyone is acting so sympathetic towards those that died in crash, maybe you could try to extend compassion to the living as well? Cuz it’s easy to show it for people who’ve passed, its practically required at times really, but I believe that better than anything Kobe stood for something more than the sport he dominates&hellip;he did everything he could to share his wealth and opportunities with those around him who weren’t where he was at financially, physically, or mentally. So stop praising the man while putting other people down because you don’t think that their voice matters. Kobe made sure he was accessible to anyone and always interacted with people from all kinds of different paths and didn’t deny anyone his respect. Stop jumping on the “I just hate her cuz blah blah” bandwagon when you basically know nothing about her I’m sure. Also, if you aren’t showing love to those around you (and not just friends and family, either) while they’re still alive, then expressing your love for them after they’ve left this world is a little pointless. It ain’t a competition to see who’s the most devastated by his death! If you did truly admire Kobe, keep his spirit alive and stop being judgmental of those you don’t understand and do things for those that haven’t had all the help you’ve gotten in life. That’s the best way to truly make his legacy last 🙏🏻 Long live 24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip Kobe 😞 1 like for your respects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God, please take extra special care of the man and his loved ones, he gave us all allot of joy. He deserves a little extra lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heaven has two GOATS with wings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i think the crash happened so fast that they weren’t even realizing it. they are all prob playing basketball in heaven right now. rip 🤍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and I feel bad for LeBron he is really sad that we lost a legend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re the best basketball though I’ll never forget about you and your daughter You’re the best</p>

<p>RIP Kobe! You will be truly missed! I&rsquo;m shocked beyond words!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she sounded like she was going to cry. rip kobe, you too gigi. 😪</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why? Just Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe didn&rsquo;t do anything&hellip;he&rsquo;s just enjoying his life with his career and family so why he is the one who died?&hellip; NBA will be not like it was before without a legend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop crying and i didn&rsquo;t even know him. Can&rsquo;t barely imagine how his family is feeling rn💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2070 wont understand a picture of Kobe and Gigi 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We love you kobe!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But hollyweird we watching y’all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe Bryant and all who perished in that tragic accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is really sad and devastating.RIP Kobe Bryant and his daughter and everyone else on the helicopter 😢😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe Hit that Hill Almost as Hard as A Woman Hitting The Wall. Turning 30..##MGTOW4LIFE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is now playing with wilt up there😭 RIP The Black Mamba</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a tragedy, Kobe was an icon, inspired an entire generation with his relentless energy and work ethic, became a role model, this really shocked not only a nation but the entire world because i am from far away from US. This certainly showed us again how valuable such people are for the humanity. May god bless him, his beautiful daughter and the all the people lost their lives in the crash as he blessed us with his smile and gave us his best in his game all the time. They all seem nice and great people. Know that you are in our prayers and our hearts goes out to Vanessa, daughters and the rest of the family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you need god the most where is he? I&rsquo;m very confused, this opens up a can of worms that I tried to keep tightly shut!!!!

<p>RIP Kobe Bryant Legend will never die</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My story of how I found out Kobe died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, me, my dad and brother were gonna go outside and shoot some hoops and then my dad looked on his phone since he got a notification. He then screamed in total shock “Holy shiz, Kobe Bryant died!”. He then told me and my brother to come inside to tell our grandmother and grandfather. He was literally in total shock, so was I. But nobody knew it was real since it just happened. But then it was confirmed. Later when we were eating pizza my dad looked on his phone for more information on Kobe and saw that his daughter died. He literally screamed. So that was it. RIP Kobe and Gigi ❤.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie Eilish was little bit crying about Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when I was younger I used to say Kobe and I didn&rsquo;t even know who he was so today I asked my older bro where did Kobe come from and he said Kobe Bryant the  best player in the world and I said did u know he died in a helicopter crash this morning and he said really and now every shot I take is going to be for Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:50 he&rsquo;s really rocking that pink outfit though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in Peace all of you who were in that helicopter. This is just terrible.</p>

<li>
<p>Kobe Bryant was the last athlete on earth I&rsquo;d have thought was about to die so soon, it wasn&rsquo;t time at all, God didn&rsquo;t save &lsquo;em.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I from now on will always wear my Kobe jersey throughout my life ✊💛💜, I promise u Kobe, u always will have my back literally and physically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first girl with green hair seems cold in heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss him already I&rsquo;m crying right now 💔💔😭😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its great to know how many people love him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo there’s 666k views on this video that’s scary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t believe it next day he was there and real now he&rsquo;s gone my love all the way from Sweden. 😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so sad&hellip; kobe is my fav basketball player and so tragic that he died first I thaught this is fake but it&rsquo;s not&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does anyone cares about the other NO FAMOUS people inside the helicopter ?  RIP to all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y r all the best ppl dying?!😭🥺🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m Sad, Too! R.I.P. both Kobe and His Daughter!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Kobe died I started crying ☹️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Kobe instead of Kobe when throwing scrunched up worksheets into the bin in class</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe what a legend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel real that he died you know? It just doesn&rsquo;t feel right. His poor family, not only did they lose a great father, husband, and son but they also lost a daughter, a sister, and granddaughter. My heart goes out to their families. Rest in Peace Kobe, Gigi, and the other 7 people on the helicopter, may God have mercy on your souls. Kobe wanted to see Gigi go to her fullest potential and leave his legacy with her, but I guess that will never happen. Gigi had so potential. My grandmother said if Kobe died and Gigi survived, Gigi would not be able to live with herself and if Gigi died and Kobe survived, he would not be able to live with himself, so God took them both at the same time. I believe we all just wish none of them had to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Kobe&rsquo;s death I decided to never anymore in my life say word &ldquo;Kobe&rdquo; when I shoot but I have a reason.First cause I think that word is too much for me and I feel sad when I say his name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh no he was my childhood OML rip kobe😭😭❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wished there was a potion where we can Resurrect the dead :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good his funeral wasn’t when the covid-19 was started but we all miss you and rip

</li>
<li>
<p>When I literally saw Justin Bieber’s pic with Kobe Bryant it literally made me so sad..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It hurts my brain that we now grieve through tweets&hellip;and so I quote Long John Silver “Them that dies will be the lucky ones!!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like no one cares about the other people in the helicopter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think when im older and ill play basketball ill just be like “FOR KOBE!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart is in pain why is god taking away all of our angels😭😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot; Now your a legend with wings now &quot; he can now dunk higher in the heavens&hellip;..R.I.P Kobe And Gigi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your in a better place this had me in tears</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie was like &ldquo;Damn I don&rsquo;t know much about Kobe Bryant what do I say?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh mamba, yeah. Hes Out 🙏🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got up yesterday when my house mates said that kobe died ? I thought it was a joke or mess read. First I said WHAT !!!  That&rsquo;s when the only thing I can see if it was true ? Was Facebook !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was at the remate when I found out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time a get a basketball shoot I’m gonna say “rip kobe the legend”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I first heard abt it I thought abt Troydan and how much he must be hurting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie Ellish : i am a bad boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also Billie : oh wait, Gucci gang Gucci gang</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine how tragic that would’ve been for his wife to find out that her husband and daughter just died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would be devastated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your custom character appears in a video game funeral 0:50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very sad and tragic accident! Patrick Swayze and Michael Landon died too but no-one knew. Probably cos it was cancer. Every life is precious. RIP y&rsquo;all.

</li>
<li>
<p>Please Kobe we love u and miss you   my heart is breaking.. I always thought  that my my tears is on u Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP legend. You really inspired me and my classmates, were always doing “KOBE” in the class as if you’d always live on.. I found this on my recommendations and I was like “no way” :( this is way too devastating as I lived my whole life listening , watching , being inspired and doing everything you did. You changed our world not only with basketball but your beautiful way of lifting people up.. And to his beautiful 13 year old daughter, Gianna was an angel who was gonna take his legacy. But was taken before she even could step into the real spotlight. You’re a star in our hearts and you always will be Gigi. You are an amazing beautiful legend with wings along side your late father. ❤️ prayers to his wife/ mother as well as their other siblings🤧</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Before i was a fan of the NBA, i knew Kobe from CSGO by everytime the gernade was thrown. He was just a legend at every part of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yesterday was the day the world stood still. Nothing else mattered we lost Kobe &hellip;.his daughter another family and more . The late Kobe Bryant &hellip;. doesn&rsquo;t even sound right 😔</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>That said , Lil Nas X would have been my first suspect if he was anywhere near that crash wearing that bright pink outfit  🧐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legends never die 😭😭😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a bad dream we all wanna wake up from 💔😟</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Godbless you Kobe and Gianna 🙏🙏❤️❤️ you inspired me in so many ways and I loved that you were a family man my prayers are with you and your daughter and family 🙏🙏❤️❤️😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s hard to believe that celebrities can die too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just them being alive makes you forget that they are just like us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don’t live forever.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2019: Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020: FOR KOBE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is astonishing to me that media still can&rsquo;t deal with news in a proper, natural manner. When something terrible happens the first thing they do is run to the books and look what the best recipe for reacting to the news is. Why do people always need scripts and props in their life? Is it that difficult for them to be human?! When interviewed about Kobe&rsquo;s death news, some NBA players were asked what was their reaction the moment they found out and what were they doing as the media&rsquo;s expectation and politically correct view on those is you to be devastated and unable to go on with your everyday life. This is how humans are made into robots!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you look at Gianna you see the best person in the Bryant’s family and now that she’s gone we hit differently when it comes to mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t  Believe there was people happy about this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really loved his family it is really sad i started to cry for 8 weeks after</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can’t imagine the pain the families go through right now</p>
</li>
