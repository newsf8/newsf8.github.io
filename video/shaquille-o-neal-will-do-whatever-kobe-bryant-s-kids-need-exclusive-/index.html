<p>Stop talking to the man. He&rsquo;s hurting. Let him grieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine losing his sister and now his friend in an accident..this is hard for him&hellip;Shaq is calm infront of the Camara but is hurting inside&hellip;thanks shaq for mentioning the  other victims</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is the real deal. His heart is huge and he respects everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúYou call me. I‚Äôm not hard to find. I‚Äôll do whatever you need.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Shaq The MFKN Boss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq‚Äôs Sister has just died,And now Kobe is gone Shaq must feel so hurt to the point where it Physically makes him hurt üòî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe&rsquo;s 3 daughters will always have Uncle Shaq as a father figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm actually worried about Shaq. He is in a dark place right now. Just leave him alone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man is hurting. He has lots to get off his chest everytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor guy is sick and tired of repeating the same thing. Leave him alone already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;My condolences go out to the other families.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have their pictures on my wall.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best thing Shaq could have said in addition to losing his friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He can&rsquo;t even look the interviewer in the eye. Shaq is hurting, he needs time to grieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gentle giant lost his brother, and you can tell he‚Äôs hurting bad. God bless you Shaq!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace, everyone aboard that helicopter who died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless this man &ndash; he&rsquo;s practically the first man to say nationally that there were other families that suffered losses that terrible day. Shaq outclassed every US news/sports outlet with this impromtu interview. And he did this while braving his own personal pain. Bless him. Reporters: ask your 3 most important questions, then back off. No matter how famed a person is, they deserve time to grieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq knows that his money don‚Äôt mean nothing. He just wants his friends and family back ü•∫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we get a prayer for Shaq? I‚Äôm worried about Shaq, he sounds like he‚Äôs in a very dark place after the passing of his sister , and now he good friend .. praying hard for big Shaq! üôèüèº

</li>
<li>
<p>There is so much sorrow in his voice. I‚Äôm pleased that he mentioned everyone on board. He is very respectful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like the other people say, leave him alone. He‚Äôs obviously struggling with Kobe‚Äôs death, he doesnt even want to be interviewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He keeps looking around so he doesn‚Äôt let any tears fall, you can tell he‚Äôs hurting bad and is trying to hold back the tears every time he talks about the situation, he needs to unload everything one good time, and just let it out. I don‚Äôt even know bro but as a human, I‚Äôd give that man a hug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he‚Äôs got a huge heart, I noticed he wouldn‚Äôt even make eye contact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we need to look after Shaq. He&rsquo;s struggling big time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m 30 years old and Shaq has been an outstanding role model, such a good person in dealing with everything he does. Such a Professional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can just tell that Shaq is actually a good hearted and genuine person, there is some celebrity that become self entitled when they become famous but Shaq is not one of the . RIP to his best friends Kobeüôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect to him saying the other victims were important too. He has pictures of them too. RESPECT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just love how he doesn‚Äôt interrupt Shaq. Everyone seems mad that people won‚Äôt stop bringing up Kobe to him. It‚Äôs good for Shaq to get these feelings settled down and you can tell commiseration is slowly helping him cope</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs a man of his word. He helped out a family at my job who lost their dad and husband. He donated a lot of things to my child‚Äôs school. He‚Äôs a beautiful being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This got me tearing up and I just loss my sister Rest Kobe GiGi and those men women and children who lost there lives in that helicopter. so so sad üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interviewer was respectful. The media on the side was disrespectful begging to speak to him repeatedly calling his name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq got on that Ghostbusters t-shirt like he knows Kobe&rsquo;s ghost is coming for his ass üòÇüëª</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mad respect for you shaq that&rsquo;s a real friend is hard to find real friends in this days God bless you and your family shaqüíúüíõüíúüíõüíúüíõüíúüíõüíúüíõüíúüíõüíúüíõüíúüíõüíúüíõüéá‚ú®üéÜüôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE how he brings up the other families and says &quot; we need to up the conversation on them too, Kobe and Gigi are important but everyone is important&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq needs a long vacation to relax, pray, think and gain perspective - his losses have been tremendous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq look like he been crying his eyes out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe has some great friends like Shaq.</p>
</li>

<p>R.I.P.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúUp the talk on the other people too, they‚Äôre important too.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad someone said ily shaq</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq cant even look at the interviewers eyes, he is struggling hard&hellip;. he is a big guy with a big heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man has been shaken to his core by Kobe‚Äôs death.  He is a great man himself!  May God comfort him through this!üôèüôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still can&rsquo;t believe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe we will not forget you.‚ù§‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the second time I have heard Shaq bring these things up! He is hurt and asking for help, I seriously hope someone is their for him!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My gosh, you can see he is devastated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He lost a brother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A soul brother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is hurting bad, i pray he talks to someone to get through this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daamnn! The energy of Shaq, his usual vibe is gone. IT&rsquo;LL NEVER BE THE SAME! RIP FOR ALL THE VICTIMS! LONG LIVE THE LEGEND KOBE!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is the only one that makes me tear up when he talks about Kobe..the big teddy bear is so sadüò∞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TO BROTHER : Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, you and your entire family are in my thoughts and prayers. keep</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your head up and stay strong !!!! you are one of my role model&rsquo;s. FROM BROTHER : Kareem Arkabar Govan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being around other folks is helping him to stay alive,  being alone at this difficult time is not a good idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He definitely isn‚Äôt afraid to show his emotions. I feel bad for him just losing his sister and now Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at a broke man there, best thing is to leave him alone, stay strong big man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also have realised how life is short and we need to tell our loved ones we love them and ador them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best remedy for someone whose experiencing physical and emotional pain is to remain active . Good job Shaq!

<li>
<p>Dude my man shaq doesnt look good, someone has to keep an eye on him, cause i Can see What His pain could lead toüòî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good man shaq is. Hes a sheriff as well damn good influence proud to say I was one of the ones bumping his jams back in the day. Whatcha know about that!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen someone as drained as Shaq looks right now. Usually I see him and he&rsquo;s smiling, having a great time, but this week every time I see him, he looks more and more drained, tired, upset, and sad. Stop interviewing him on this, man. He&rsquo;s already got so much on his mind and you can see that his pain is immense. I hope that soon enough his pain will subside and we&rsquo;ll start to see a changed, but genuinely happy Shaq again. We need it, but more importantly, he needs it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq you did very well in that interview you have a big heart and I can tell your sad and hurt you held ot together I&rsquo;m sorry for the loss of Kobe bryant and his daughter and others that died may they rest in peace and my thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and a family of everyone who lost someone may they be remembered by all who loved them. üåπ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEOPLE&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t give the hate on the pilot he lost his LIFE too _ rip all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That‚Äôs a Thing I can‚Äôt understand in all this tragedy&hellip; it‚Äôs ASKING MONEY for Kobe Bryant Foundation!!!! To support the other 3 families?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean with all the Respect but I‚Äôm sure that will be an insurance to cover this accident!! It happened in one of most richest zones in the World!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is beautiful. Stepping in for Kobe‚Äôs kids is beautiful!!!‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only time Shaq looked at the camera was when he was talking to Kobe&rsquo;s little ones. He&rsquo;s hurtin bad&hellip;.hang in there big fella</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s really honorable of him. Good to see people trying to give something to the families after the accident ü§ç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s a real friend to kobe Bryant. We need more people like you shaq</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Shaq more and more every time I see him; he‚Äôs such a good man and his love for his family his friends and people in general  is so moving. I‚Äôm sorry for his losses.  ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a perfectly wonderful and whole hearted man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People saying he‚Äôs different after, He lost his close friend to a freak accident, and someone is literally asking him about that personal loss on camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t talking about the 10th person who was suppose to be on the helicopter too,  that opted out before the chopper took off , due to weather conditions? He drove his car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gosh I wish they&rsquo;d leave hum alone, we can all see the sadness in his eyes, we all can never feel his sadness. Shaq needs some time to sit down and let his feelings go, he doesn&rsquo;t need all of these people interviewing him. I may have never of heard of shaq but he seems really depressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bless those who were affected by this, like it shouldn‚Äôt of happened, but live goes on. #KobeandGianna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praying for you Shaq. You can see the hurt in his face it&rsquo;s only been a week &amp; a day that Kobe has been gone so sad Rest In Heavenly Peace Kobe &amp; GiGi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy is hurting so bad. Look at his eyes. Says 1000 words</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a proponent for the women&rsquo;s game the way Kobe wanted to be. That was and is important

<p>God it‚Äôs just so tragic, I only feel a small amount of his pain and I can‚Äôt hardly stand it. My heart goes out to this man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt wanna know how it feel to lose a sister n a brotherüò¢‚ÄºÔ∏èüèÄ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This interview was sadly brought to you by Gold Bond Medicated powder, Icy Hot, and The General Insurance! ‚òπüò¢üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People saying Shaq having a hard time with this one, but yall got to remember he JUST lost his lil sister too. The big man lost a brother and a sister within months of each other, and when you have a heart as big as Shaqs thats something that you never really get over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bruh hes in pain leave him alone .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG leave the man alone bruh you can see it in his eyes he can‚Äôt take the talking anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hes hurting so bad because they&rsquo;ve been on bad terms so many times .. maybe they argued and he had no time to make up about it üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will get that rich and famous people taking care of rich and famous people&rsquo;s kids and neglect in so much pain and strife out in the world. This makes me sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq needs some time to himself for a while. I can‚Äôt imagine talking about losing a friend constantly on camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone leave the man alone he is very emotional üò≠ he is awesome guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Ahaha! I got five you got four!&rdquo; That was pretty funny tbh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masonic brothers til the end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq has always been an emotionally intelligent guy, with an amazing sense of humour.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt call me uncle Shaq for nothing‚Äù family is family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man to have a big golden heart that‚Äôs running on diesel, Shaq Diesel!! It never fails to amaze me the kindness and goodwill this man has done for so so many. God Bless you Shaq!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lost it when he said i want to tell HIM those things, i want to say my daughter is 15 and ur daughter is this age, this hurts. i never watched him play and i only saw maybe 1/2 of his interviews, but i knew he existed in the world and was a legend and just idk man this is hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found it interesting Shaq never once looked at the person interviewing him. üòÇ odd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is, and will always be the man. His heart matches his size ‚Äê such a good dude

<p>I really hope Shaq is seeking help. He‚Äôs truly suffering between his sister and now Kobe. He‚Äôs such an amazing man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a ‚Äúmartyr‚Äù &hellip; ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I see shaq I feel so calm he‚Äôs such a good guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im sorry did Shaquilicious just say &ldquo;Did you see my car?&rdquo; to start the interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go watch Shaq fall if you haven‚Äôt seen it though. After watching this you will need a smile. It‚Äôs all in good fun nothing mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is not just big physically, he also has a big heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We always felt it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love, love, love how he uplifted the other victims.  Rest easy divine 9.  üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much respect, Shaq. Truly a cool and caring man.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>TERRANCE OUT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know what I‚Äôm gonna say it I feel like this wasn‚Äôt it, something ain‚Äôt right here with what happened to Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq: &ldquo;I have no brother all the time&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It hurts to see him in this state of trauma, he looks so unbelievably disconnected from host. He is just in so much grief and shock I feel and continuing to ask those kinds of questions only amplifies it. I am so sad to see this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the interview, all i heard was ‚ÄòShaq! Shaq! ShaaaaQ!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal: honorable man !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love to see the love everyone is showing for the G.O.A.T..  Much respect to ShaqüíØ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;We want to have a new daddy&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dislike how they are already asking him about this. Give them time to grieve. They are already dealing with so much. Just because they are &ldquo;big&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean they should have to answer what everyone wants right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get an advertisement contract or something.

<li>
<p>GOD Bless You Shaq for having a Big Heart &amp; seeing the need to be there for Kobe&rsquo;s Family &amp; for recognizing the Other Families Who lost Their Loved Ones as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love Shaq! Much respect for him all these years and even more now that he is carrying the torch!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i cant deal with this anymore everytime someone was doing good stuff and passes away all these news stations abuses their passing for money stop exploiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God Jesus man, I‚Äôve never seen shaq like this and it hurts trust me, my thoughts and prayers go out to all effected by the tragic helicopter crash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq‚Äôs such a wonderful human being!  I just love him! Class act!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember when shaq was sat across from Kobe and they were havd a laugh about 5 trophies to 4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We love you Shaq!  Love to all those dealing w/ broken hearts out there!  Love &amp; much Prayer!  #neverforgotten #lovetoall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im sorry Im not a basketball fan. But I&rsquo;ve always loved Shaq. He a genuine human!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for Shaq. People will ask him about Kobe for the rest of his life because their legacies are intertwined. That&rsquo;s going to be tough to deal with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that people are trying to forget about the others that also perished its just that KOBE has been in everyone&rsquo;s home for 20+ years so we are more familiar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq so tall he can‚Äôt even find the interviewer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can clearly see that he‚Äôs lookin for him with his eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm so glad he acknowledged the other families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing but respect for Shaq! Heal in peace brotha and get your mind right ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is the real dude he&rsquo;s not one of those that let fame get to him. this was genuine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of hurt and pain in this mans voice. Been through a lot in the last little bit of life. With all the money and fame you are still a human and that shows with him all the time. He‚Äôs a true friend. I‚Äôve got best friends for 30 years and yeah we‚Äôve had disagreements for something they done I didn‚Äôt like or I done they didn‚Äôt like but it‚Äôs about talking about it and moving past it that‚Äôs what makes you brothers. Sorry for the loses in life you‚Äôve had lately Shaq we are all thinking of the family‚Äôs and friends of Kobe his wife kids parents and all the others lost on the flight. Many young lives lost and many lives changed forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:36 oh my days. Great point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not use to seeing Shaq, üíî Praying to the most high, that he be with ShaqüôåüèΩ and with all the others affected by this tragedy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq to me is a man to be looked up to. I&rsquo;m so happy that I got to see him and kobe play. Koby was fortunate to have shaq as a friend and brother as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the end of the interview pissed me off, he just poured his heart out, and all the other reporters just start yelling his name to get their own sob story for clicks. i know its their job, but i hate it for him.

<p>shaq and his wife was up in MA a while back and they were amazing people, they went to bed bath and beyond</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish they&rsquo;d let these people mourn a little before asking them at every stop about their lost loved one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man shaq looks like he needs a hug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets take a moment to pray for those we lost and all the families in mourningüôèüôèüôèüôèüíØ</p>

<p>Hopefully he let it all out soon. Scream,  run, cry whatever it takes to help you cope. Clearly Shaq is holding it all in.</p>

<p>Can‚Äôt even look at the interviewer? respect man!

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Here‚Äôs a question I didn‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm having a tough how the hell do you think Shaq feels !!!  Why keep asking about Kobe?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless him and his daughter during this time of extreme shock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hurt in Shaq‚Äôs eyes is tangible. You can feel his emotions through the screen. My heart is still broken, and I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine the utter turmoil those families are experiencing right now. My prayers go out to them, and I hope they‚Äôll have the strength to get through these horrendous times&hellip; RIP to all those who passed away&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man is one of a kind and right now going through a lot Kobe and him had that duo bond of Basketball üèÄüèÄRIP Homeboy Philly sports Hall of Fame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotta Love the Shaq, a class act all the way.RIP Kobe &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That‚Äôs very caring for you Shaq I respect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You bro I was in foster care for 21 years with no dad or mom I turned out to do bad decision and still kinda do I hate it god will help you and I hope he helps me and keeps me focus ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs so funny I came across this video. It just popped up on my news feed Shaq is truly a Gentle Giant and has a heart made of diamonds(beyond gold) My sincere condolences to him loosing his brother Kobe!. But, I just want to backup what He said in stating ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt call me Uncle Shaq for nothing‚Äù When he says he‚Äôll be there he will üíØ back up his word!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when my dad died I just got benefits ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can definitely tell he&rsquo;s hurt! And needs help. He&rsquo;s sayings it constantly that he&rsquo;s not right. Pray for Shaq!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait i&rsquo;ve seen this guy on a kpop show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this the same guy who interviewed mike tyson and mentioned something about his rape case?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>' You can tell that this interview isn&rsquo;t easy for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was straight from the heart!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man is really really hurt, he is crying on the inside, my heart goes out to him, he lost his friend his brother,   i can feel his pain on so many levels, he aint acting out for the cameras, his emotions are real, kobe and his Daughter will definitely will be missed ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your Daddy now&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he said &ldquo;sorry I don&rsquo;t have the names, but i have the pictures on my wall&rdquo; it shows me that Shaq is a true and real person. To want to help take care of those families means a lot when it comes to reality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His sister just died as well. He‚Äôs going through it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&rsquo;t talk about &lsquo;who&rsquo;s the greatest center of all time?&rsquo; without talking about Shaq. And still, he&rsquo;s a far better person than he ever was a player.

<li>
<p>I love that he acknowledges all the families involved .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still sticking to that sad face act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq: &ldquo;Kids, kids,kids, kids, kids, kids, kids will know who the Great Kobe Bryant was&rdquo; 3:19</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I loved that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs crazy how you can just stand there at look at Shaq an icon who once played as well who was once a young star in his prime. Time is an interesting thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know he&rsquo;ll do it for them, that man hurting. Take your time Shaq I know the pain&hellip;missing opportunities to say anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen him not be able to look the interviewer or the cameraman in the eye.  He is like a big sad teddy bear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember the first time and only time I saw Shaq in person, it was his rookie year and they played the Celtics in Hartford Connecticut. I kept yelling his name during shootout practice and he looked over at me and winked. That was one of those memories where you&rsquo;ll never forget you made eye contact with a legend. Point of the story is, Shaq would stop what he&rsquo;s doing just to let you know he noticed you. Love you for that Shaq!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq‚Äôs got a big body but he has an even bigger heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad he pointed that out about the other families.  I&rsquo;ve made several comments on different sites indicating that.  All the families are touched my this tragedy.  May God bless them all. This has  definitely affected him in a very personal way.  Praying for his family also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awwwww he so SWEET.üò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are you doing bro? My heart goes out to you all. Love always..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg I love him. Pure class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gentle giant lost his brother, and you can tell he‚Äôs hurting bad. God bless you Shaq!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs a mad wholesome guy bro
