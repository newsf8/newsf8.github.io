<p>That has to be the absolute worst situation for a parent to be in. Holding your 13 yr old child and comforting her&hellip; knowing you’re both going to be gone in seconds. I can’t imagine. So sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s why she was with him. They   could not be separated, ever. RIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s athletic, healthy and strong but he was killed by a tragic accident. Life is sometimes cruel and unfair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine what is going threw Vanessa&rsquo;s head rn. and the fact that Kobe had to sit there with Gigi holding her while they both died is the saddest thing. I didn&rsquo;t kno Kobe but to the people that knew him personally that must be rly hard. Rest In Peace and fly high up there🕊🕊💔🤧😞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let’s talk about the other people that died. they’re just as important as kobe bryant but no one seems to give them as much attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To know as a father in his final moments that he could not protect his child is completely devastating. Prayers for the people close to them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The youngest daughter’s middle name is Kobe. Sadly she will never know her father 😢😢♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He always talking about his kid&rsquo;s  the fact he was taking his daughter and her teammate to game is heartbreaking 💔😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 months? He has a 7 month old child? What a tragedy, she won’t get to know her wonderful father and sister</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s so sad&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his daughter was so pretty.. lookin just like each other</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P to them and the 7 others..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She died with her father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure she could&rsquo;ve handled living without him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first things that went on in my mind.</p>
</li>

<li>his wife must be going though hell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being in that situation where your daughter is afraid and can&rsquo;t help her. Darn. Kobe died twice today.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Rest in Power Kobe, Gigi and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his wife must be living the actual hell, it&rsquo;s her husband and her kid, i&rsquo;m so sorry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so bad , imagine how their mother and siblings feel right now</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Rest well 24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine how awful it’d be for his wife and other three kids. His young baby will grow up not even remembering her own dad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our body is just a  shell- our Spirits will live forever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dad and Daughter is playing a game of one on one in heaven for the angles in the crowd, AND THE CROWD GOES WILD !!!!!!!   WOW !</p>

<p>This just proves that we can’t guarantee tomorrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omy gosh I can&rsquo;t even start to fathom how his wife is feeling. Her heart, she just lost 2 of her soul. I pray she finds strength, as time goes by.  Also his other daughters, my heart breaks for all of them. I pray God has them in his kingdom🙏🏻🙏🏻💔💞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP for all 9 people that died in this terrible accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We never know when we&rsquo;ll be facing God, so spend your life getting close to Him and loving and uplifting others. God rest their souls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though I didn’t really know him, I cried because his own daughter died with him at the same time and over the same thing 😪😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ginnia followed in Kobe footsteps they even went in heaven together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t even imagine their final moments. 😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m crying so much rn 😭😭imagine Gigi being so scared and kobe trying to comfort her during that situation  😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t even feel real. My heart goes out to his wife and 3 surviving daughters as well as his family and friends. This is a next level blow. Praying for them!

<p>He valued raising the next generation to be the best they could be. Man had his priorities straight. RIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for all you people just remember his wife is really sad and I got to talk to him in person and I didn’t believe it till I seen the news just prey for his family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For now on Instead of saying Kobe Say “For Kobe” please Do this &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So devastating, I can imagine Gianna being terrified and Kobe trying to clam her down. My heart goes out to Vanessa and her family. Rest Above angels!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life can change so quickly, let not take it granted that your loved ones are still here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m praying for his wife and his other girls&hellip; my heart goes out to them 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn! Still doesn’t feel real</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna and god bless the family 🙏❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omfg not just kobe&hellip;but his daughter. This is an absolute tragedy, I&rsquo;ve never felt so bad for someone I haven&rsquo;t met. He was such a great person and father</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP to all that lost there lives my condolences my thoughts and prayers to all that were affected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is unpredictable. You never know what will happen in the future. I feel bad for Kobe&rsquo;s family especially Vanessa that she lost the love of her life and she lost one of her sweet angels..</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code> And her 2 little siblings won't remember her... I just really feel bad for them.. 
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>I guess Jesus is already fetching you from Heaven. At least Gianna was wrapped around in her father. 
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This heaches my heart 💔, it’s sad how close they were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gigi was only 13 she did&rsquo;t git to live her life long and kobe to we miss you kobe and gigi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart broke gigi had so much to live for. Life isn&rsquo;t fair, I can&rsquo;t imagine the pain Vanessa is going through losing her baby and her husband.😔🙏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God help them the wife of kobe and the sibling more strength and pray for them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I imagine that moments before the fatal crash, he could only hold her tight and telling her that it is going to be ok😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This made me sad throughout the whole day after finding out after 3pm. When you grow up seeing someone grow up along with you and doing so much it feels like its a family member. I cannot imagine how their family must feel. If me,a stranger is devastated about it&hellip;</p>

<p>This is so sad. Any situation where a parent is holding on to their child about to die is devastating. My heart goes out to the family. This is terrible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet, nothing ever happens to the Kardashians. It&rsquo;s always the good ones taken away &amp; the filthy rich good for nothing ones left on 🌎 to continue being greedy &amp; materialistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a great loss this is for humanity! Breaks my heart! Breaks many hearts throughout the world! 🙏♥🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant believe this dear goodness T.T</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a luving father n daughter gone too soon and may there family be blessed a thousand fold. The Lord called 2 of his home. God bless you and my condolences to the family. T.T</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know for the most part exactly how they are feeling at this moment. I’m 17 and 6 months ago 3 of my siblings. My brother, sister and step brother died. They went to the beach one day and waves swept them away and they drowned. I’m sure by now they’ve cried so much till they can’t anymore and just feel numb and in a state or shock and disbelief. Life will never be the same again as it is for me. Tomorrow they’ll wake up and feel like aliens in the world, still in disbelief wondering how could this happen  to them. The hardest days are yet to come for them. But they eventually we’ll see light. They will discover and strength they didn’t think they had. This will bring the mother and her remaining children more close than ever. They will always mourn their lose and never truly ever accept but they will learn to adjust to a life that doesn’t feel worth living most of the time. The mother more then likely will have major thoughts of suicide but with strength won’t give in because of her children she has left, but will not fear the day that she’s reunited with her daughter and husband.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May they both Rest In Peace. My heart goes out to his family.  God bless you all. So so sorry for this tragic loss.🙏</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>R.I.P Kobe I love you I always say you’re name whenever I make a dunk in the trash can from a paper ball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine how it felt to know that it would be your final moments and you had nothing to stop it..😣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We was all watching it in the bar yesterday wondering what the names of the other 7 victims was.  You would think Kobe and his daughter was only ones in that bird.🤨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s really sad because they were both alive a couple hours ago 🥺😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Times like these really make you excited for the time when death will be a thing of the past. That’s a promise that will come true soon!

<p>Heartbreaking. RIP Gianna and Kobe 💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant even imagine what they were doing before the crash, i cant imagine how kobe comforted her daughter when they knew they&rsquo;re gonna crash, what i know is that as a A person, knowing he&rsquo;s a dad, it hurts my heart thinking how kobe is hoping in that moment that her daughter would survive that crash  at least. However God has different plan. May God bless their family. Our deepest condolences.</p>

<p>2020 is a devastating year and now we lost another legend 😢
