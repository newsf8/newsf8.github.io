<li>
<p>Not a traditionally trained diplomat, just a traditionally trained liar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Webster‚Äôs Dictionary, next to the definition of ‚Äúdouche bag‚Äù, there is a picture of Jared Kushner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The urge to beat Jared into a pulp is almost unbearable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With him being &ldquo;in charge of the Middle East&quot;how come no one questions the fact that he desparately needed a bailout on his failed 666 Fifth Avenue property for a huge balloon mortgage, went to Saudi Arabia and supported a blockade to Qatar&hellip;.he then gets an investment of &ldquo;$1.4 billion&rdquo; from the government of Qatar&hellip;.. blockade is then removed.     Isn&rsquo;t that a conflict of interest&hellip;or quid pro quo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm surprised Creepy Mx porcelain puppet doesn‚Äôt melt out in the daylight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like sweaty hot dog in a suit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human flush-able wipe VS Christiane Amanpour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is going to be fvck1ng epic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store-brand Ken doll needs to crawl back to the dumpster he came from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stone, Jared, Miller, bunch of SWEJ destroying this country to benefit their kind!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Jared was set on fire he wouldn&rsquo;t burn because he&rsquo;s just too slimy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy says trump&rsquo;s record is &ldquo;unimpeachable&rdquo; when he was LITERALLY impeached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a weasel is a prerequisite for being in the trump administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year from now he will be complaining about his prison cell condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He sounds and reply‚Äôs like kellyanne Conway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared &ldquo;Criminal Robot Boy&rdquo; talks a lot and still sounds uniformed and defensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would love to wipe those smirks off his smug little face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The perfect son in law for Trump.  He lies on his behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stringbean lies like his father inlaw.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He sounds just like his father in law: verbatim. Deny everything, spin the story and attack the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The orange clown clearly said, &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t born in the US.&rdquo; ü§£ She was born in California to both doctors. üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy is up to his father in law&rsquo;s standards. Birds of a feather flock together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only woman trump hasn&rsquo;t called nasty is Ghislaine Maxwell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚Äúwe don‚Äôt show more cards than we need to‚Äù &hellip; does anyone else have a problem with that statement or is it just me? this isn‚Äôt poker this isn‚Äôt blackjack this is real life. so sick of these colonizers ruining our nation. #DUMPTRUMP2020üá∫üá∏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If evil has a face, he must look like Jared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The federal stockpile (masks, ventilators) are for us, not the states.&rdquo; - Jared Kushner.  Who is &ldquo;us&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biden/Harris 2020&hellip;THE PEOPLE DEMAND IT!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Unimpeachable.&rdquo; Interesting choice of words, Jared, given that Pop in law has been impeached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He tries to smile but he smirks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has so much respect for her he can‚Äôt pronounce her name right, lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a traditionally trained diplomat&hellip; but I&rsquo;m going to do it anyway&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He has an unimpeachable track record&hellip;&rdquo; he says of the guy who was literally impeached! ü§£ü§£ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kushner is smiling. This smile tells me everything. That was the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MADE UP A LIE AND LET IT FLY&hellip;   This is Trump&rsquo;s motto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just Kushner&rsquo; association of &ldquo;Black&rdquo; with &ldquo;unemployment,&rdquo; &ldquo;low income&rdquo; and &ldquo;criminal justice&rdquo; reflects his deep racism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If constipation had a face it would be Jared&rsquo;s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think I recognise him from the Bates Hotel üòÇ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had no idea Isreal and the UAE were at war, oh that&rsquo;s right, they weren&rsquo;t. more smoke and mirrors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did he actually say ‚Äúunimpeachable‚Äù

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He say, ‚ÄúThe media often gets distracted with the president‚Äù. I wonder who‚Äôs responsible for this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In between his answers he does this smug smile as if to say he did a grest job. A narcissist just like his father in law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally Kelly Ann just told him in his ear piece who he was being interviewed by so he said it correctly. nice job Jason Kushner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared&rsquo;s a crook just like his convict dad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever performed Jared&rsquo;s bris should have cut his tongue out instead. Everything he spews is trafe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>America&rsquo;s most slappable face everyone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why does this afterbirth think that the US relations are better? Everyone hates the US now and the US doesnt really hide the &ldquo;America first&rdquo; message either. What a load of bs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what is the purpose by giving this people any time on TV/ internet. Keep them muted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a traditionally trained diplomat. Is he a traditionally trained anything?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it so hard for him to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for what my dad has done, I&rsquo;ll see that he doesn&rsquo;t do this again&rdquo; Just a tiny apology, that&rsquo;s allü§èüèøüôÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mispronounces name</em>, I have so much respect for you.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>üòÇ Yeah sure, Jared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor Jared has to blink 20 times in 20 seconds to keep his reptilian eyes moist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§´ Trump is not solely responsible for the downfall of the Republican Party&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>üëâ&hellip;he is just the end result of the Republican Party‚Äôs downfall! üëà</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does Kushner always look like he is about to start crying any second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s well spoken . I&rsquo;m surprised but even tRuMp himself said it that he&rsquo;s doing everything to suppressed the election so he&rsquo;s lying and I&rsquo;m not sure why</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes he has a track record of lying, cheating and denegrating anyone that doesn&rsquo;t  agree with him. Yes he has done a great job-NOT.

<p>I would like to see Mike Tyson knock the smirk off that face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a traditionally trained diplomat&hellip; but I&rsquo;m going to do it anyway&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is not insinuating, I jeTd him on the news</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just hoping this souless ghoul croaks, take your father in law with you, make sure you cough all over each other!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it my ears or did he keep calling her Christian?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I looked up arrogance and saw the smirk on Jared Kushner&rsquo;s face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson once said: For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You&rsquo;d be surprised how far that gets you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All this guy needs is a tail and horns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cleaned up the middle-east&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ya, he pulled out all of our pushback against aggression from Russian mercs in Syria.  Russia has been watching us and poking at us for years from Syria and we used EA-6B Prowlers to poke back and limit their ability to peer behind our curtain. Go ahead and Google where those planes are now and when they left. Yes, they weren&rsquo;t perfect, and yes they were old&hellip; but what is performing their role now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scary clown that JK. With everything he says, remember he is part of the most horrible maffia housing organization in the United States. ü§Æü§Æü§Æ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like he had a bottle of sour milk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a well-trained mouth, that will serve him good in prison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say he didn&rsquo;t know,he said he just had heard about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder what its like to be married into a family that requires you to lie to everybody to gain favor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just another liar like his father in law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track Record? Are you kidding?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many died while you were smirking away!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was born on American soil, therefore she is a natural-born citizen according to the Constitution.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>He is one creepy human doll. Ot is very messed up that he is getting paid taxpayer money for his wholly nepotistic job placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That guy is that stupid it‚Äôs amazing he knows how to breathe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The smirk on his face say it all, time will tell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the time comes he and all of his family must pay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lying? Its in their bloods. It is natural for them to lied and denied, they don&rsquo;t know the word &ldquo;SHAME&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have Jared Kushner‚Äôs face on my punching bag.</p>
</li>

<p>&ldquo;Unimpeachable record&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man is the unelected President of the United States. He is the epicenter many Trump failures</p>

<p>Why? Kershner, trump, and his whole criminal enterprise need jailed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hahaha JARED the &ldquo;senior&rdquo; lifeless skinny infant cyborg üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are asking a man who was caught insider dealing from his position within the White House and whose father is a convicted felon.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Historic middle east peace deal&rdquo; - he is of the Jewish faith, can you imagine if say a Palestinian had brokered the deal instead? What would he be saying about it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t the Palestians included in this Mddle East  peace agreement ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did say she wasn&rsquo;t qualified and said he didn&rsquo;t know Hwy the Democrats didn&rsquo;t check it out. Look at the replay!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole damn family is no good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>America why do you support them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They keep lying, America keeps dying!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guy is a repeat machine, repeating his father‚Äôs tone. That‚Äôs it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Jared personally: I miss my dad too. It&rsquo;s ok to be sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kushner is going to jail too, just like his father in law! Yahoooooo!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him at his word.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you look at the presidents track record he should be in Guantanamo Bay, jared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever Jared talks all I hear is a high pitched version of Charlie Brown&rsquo;s teacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m not a traditionally trained diplomat&hellip;&rdquo;  = I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing and no qualifications as being a senior advisor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s rebuilt alliances that the previous administration alienated.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Oh, like with Russia? While meanwhile alienating all of NATO? Well done, well done. Golf clap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you believe this man , then please let me sell you a bridge for a good price, just for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip cannon hinnant, this horrid news source comes up when you search his name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I absolutely can‚Äôt stand Kushner. He is disgusting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kushner is so corrupt and deceitful. He&rsquo;s been using Kanye as a pawn (The Atlantic described it this way) to sabotage the elections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I first saw this guy, I thought ‚Äúoh this is the Antichrist‚Äù. Then I heard him speak and I realized ‚Äúno, he‚Äôs not‚Äù.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biden and Trump are both intensely focused on losing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared Kusher has a smile that even makes the Devil himself cringe badly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>160,000 dead under trump and he thinks he&rsquo;s done well. Who&rsquo;s he kidding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He laughed like an imbecile. Just like his father in law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ever notice how trumps lies always start out ‚Äúsome people say&hellip;‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump‚Äôs calculated dismantling of USPS proves one thing clearly: He is WELL AWARE that we do not want him as our president. He‚Äôs chosen to blatantly cheat and put millions of Americans‚Äô lives at risk in an effort to hold on to power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kutchner is an extension of the LIAR in Chief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;. Kutchner is leaving a money trail that we need to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is doing him a favor to play dumb?? He is clearly killing this interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donald: If he wasnt my son in law, I&rsquo;d probably date him!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These family create more drama and insecurity they should just give up their position. Pointless lies is not helping them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Uninpeachable&rdquo;, last time I checked, he&rsquo;s impeached but not removed from office. Also, he&rsquo;s literally dodging the question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y‚Äôall are aware that the reporter asked the President that question first right??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder if you Christiane,your husband Ruben, Albright,Hilary and Bill Clinton /with plot and caver from CNN / will ever apologize  for the chaos in Balkan you provoked with false stories and accusations&hellip;and for  bombing innocent people too.

<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just so Evil.  I can&rsquo;t stand to look at him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s of &ldquo;I&rdquo; when he speaks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OOPS! One problem with dimples: when he was asked about the mailed ballots, his eyes darted to the right while he smiled as if to think: I have the dialog for this question. I know what they told me to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welll if Newsweek says Kamala &ldquo;Heels Up&rdquo; Harris is ineligible and isn&rsquo;t even a legitimate citizen it must be true. Newsweek is like the Fake News CNN of magazines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That dude reminds me of one of those intrusive stupid people book thumpers who knock on your door at 7 am on a Sunday morning uninvited wanting to talk about stone age fairy tale creatures who represent nothing but war, cruelty, death and destruction throughout history that don&rsquo;t now, never have and never will exist. I wish these people would learn to use their brains then step into reality and understand what the SUN is and has always been.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily Reminder: Trump called Corona Virus a Democrat Hoax that will &ldquo;miraculously&rdquo; disappear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waste of time interviewing a guy like him like father-in-law, like son-in-law they should  be wiped out from the white house in Nov. ASAP! &quot; share prosperity&rdquo; really?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who at CNN had the nerve to get Christiane to interview that boy? Don&rsquo;t they have interns to interview these trump things?? So sorry Christiane! This is so embarrassing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will have Trump as a president for 4 more years. Enjoy üëçüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His DNA is similar to that of his f.i.l. - habitual liars. Period!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone needs to slap that smirk of his face&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The real question to ask is. Does it hurt when trumps daughter uses her strap on on you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is reading from a tele-promter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOSE-STEINS like jared are rejects, 109 countries have expelled them for a reason. Not sure why the likes of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>him and soviet melania are even allowed in this country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One JARED&rsquo;S voice breaks and he doesn&rsquo;t sound like Mickey Mouse, I might listen to this boy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kid has no business in the white house  ! Lies  just like the big boy !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He laughed at her, shows the utter disrespect and disdain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All bs we know he racist it seem like he the only one don‚Äôt know can‚Äôt wait to vote against him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember, the governor of the State of Missouri told his constituents in a press briefing in April, just don‚Äôt vote. A true Trump sycophant

</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Who do these cretins think they are?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The camera pans down, revealing a growing pool of slime preceded by a long trail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared &lsquo;s father was always a straight shooter to .look at his history .all skim .go away please</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOW just a  stunning denial of evil.  Jared is in the White House to co-sign his father in laws lies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truth is this administration has left the government in a shambles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared, the PO handles tons of Christmas mail every year so young one, they could easily handle it if Mr Dejoy had not cut out overtime, removed 700 sorting machines each capable of sorting millions of pieces of mail on a daily basis, and removed drop boxes from big cities. Pretty obvious what‚Äôs going on here Jared. Doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to figure out what Trump is trying to do through DeJoy. But the word is out and all his BS won‚Äôt matter because we all know and will vote super early which isn‚Äôt good for your boss‚Äôs chances at winning in Nov.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has anyone remember the movie, &quot; interview with a vampire?&rdquo;  Starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise.  THAT&rsquo;S IT!!! He freaks me out!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s a goblin!  Why would anyone bother to talk to him???!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annexation controversy requiring a &ldquo;peace deal&rdquo; seemed like an empty-threat setup from the beginning, so I was waiting for the other shoe to fall that would no doubt benefit Trump. And voila&hellip; here it is. Now Trump&rsquo;s taking credit for the peace deal he allegedly negotiated. Really?  I don&rsquo;t believe that for a minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more he talks the sweater he gets, and his cheeks turn red while lying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is bewildering is laying knowing that eventually you will be caught</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever heard Jared have a conversation with anyone! Jared Kushner is a 1988ish New York City Spin Doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kill em with kindness, you‚Äôll always come out looking like the winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look who‚Äôs qualified for his position ü§£üòÇü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She lied about being Native American, it stands to reason she lied about everything else also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at Jared Kushner I can help thinking &lsquo;the personification of hypocrisy&rsquo;, no matter how much he talks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did she say &lsquo;everybody&rsquo; wants a fair election üòÇüòÇüòÇ? Yeah, everybody but you know who and his corrupt crewüòè.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúThe louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons.‚Äù

<p>FFS trying to bring people together my arse, I had to laugh..Jared is very strange</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He always looks like he&rsquo;s being given the 3rd degree (nervous sweating).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the first time I have heard Jared being interviewed, TOP JOB Jared.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The Abraham Accord&hellip;. that is a Master Stroke and unifying name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITS NOT LIKE TRUMP HAS SPEND 1 SECOND TO MAKE THIS DEAL HAPPEN&hellip;. OBVIOUSLY THEY GIVE THE BIG BABY THE CREDIT&hellip; WHAT A MORON</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is a liar just like his daughter and son in law&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perfect son in law doing as he is told, someone has given him some rosy cheeks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Track record&rdquo; Trump hasn&rsquo;t done anything since day one except getting us fighting with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a reason why people like jared were wiped out in Eastern Europe. The rest of Europe got rid of them too. Anyone surprised why no one wants them in their country ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This clown is a joke. Remember keeping everyone in the loop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some needs to Joffrey this little princeling. Man what a punchable face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would pay Stone cold Steve Austin $1000 to drop this panty waist on &ldquo;the stack of dimes he calls a neck&rdquo;, then chug 2 beers üçª over him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like the embryo from the movie 2001!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared: You can&rsquo;t lie this one away.  I watched him say this with my own eyes.  Heard him say this with my own ears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace deal&hellip;?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>My god, the utter nonsense from the US government is laughable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump has definitely alienated our allies. Jared is as dirty as his felon father.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He shouldn&rsquo;t speak like that with a well respect &amp; well regard journalist. So disgraceful, distaste of a people Tramp?, whole families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s an utter psycho. Should be in prison with his father-in-law and may well be sometime next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign Affairs specialists say Middle East &quot; treaty&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump knew Russia was pay bounty for killing our troops and did nothing. Said he didn&rsquo;t discuss it with Putin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared has GASLIGHTING down perfectly.  It&rsquo;s a requirement in THE ORANGE TOXIC MESS REGIME.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when cnn apologizes for the onslaught of lies and nonsense they run 24 hours a day then they can even think to ask for an apology from anyone - NON NEWS!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kushner is lying. We all heard 45 question Harris&rsquo; birthplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media attacking Trump for &ldquo;spreading conspiracy theories&rdquo; when it was actually first brought up by a Newsweek article. But again, facts don&rsquo;t matter, the only thing that matters to them is orange man bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As she goes on with her comments and questions his face looks like he really needs to go take a poop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared is correct. Trump* has nurtured relationships with world powers Obama distanced from. Like Russia, China and North Korea at the expense of Canada, Mexico, Great Britton and the European Union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Jared is not even qualified to be a member of the government of the USA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What qualifies Jared for his job? He‚Äôs as unqualified to be in the White House as is his moron father-in-law!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why Kushner is Second in Command, it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;ll never give up the Commander in Chief!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kushner ‚Äûlearned‚Äú a lot of trump. He talkes the same s..t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor interviewer, she should have challenged the &ldquo;Trump said he didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; because he didn&rsquo;t say that. Get with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This lady has no idea what an allegation is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared always looks like he is disgusted with himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He hasn‚Äôt done much of nothing for the BLACK Community but put the black men in graves or jail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at his track record of racism from being prosecuted for housing discrimination to the Central Park five I guess racism runs in the family Jared . He has alienated our allies all over the world . I just can‚Äôt stand this moron .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So why are they not talking about the Middle East Peace Agreement??

</li>
<li>
<p>But HE is smarter than the experts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol cushion learned how to lie as well as his father in law.  Evade questions and lie.  What else can we expect from these leeches?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just feel like slapping this little spoiled boy. He is unable to understand the real problem in  the middle east.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tweety Bone Spurs did far more than just say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David Cornstein said in Hungary that there is a World War.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, Jared, you just avoid, and avoid and avoid and avoid  answering the question and tell a bunch of lies about what you know he did. You&rsquo;re just as bad as your father in law. Liars to the bone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is he not trying to unite his own country??? He‚Äôs done a great job of dividing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s like that weird kid from Sin City.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except I think he&rsquo;d scream while the wolves ate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll take him at his word‚Äù. Nobody else willüôÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perfect opportunity for an actual witch hunt and get this whole &lsquo;family&rsquo; up on pyres and BOOM!!!!! So many problems solved!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was a crap interview. I guess they agreed to softball questions in advance with no fact check</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But he hasn&rsquo;t brought peace to the moddle East. He&rsquo;s just steam rolling over muslims lol</p>
