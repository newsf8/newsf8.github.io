<p>How in the hell are they gonna list religion on a birth certificate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This baby is Presbyterian.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, our family is Jewish actually.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m a doctor, ok?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, this is usually the nicest guy on television, and he&rsquo;s pissed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still waiting for Trump tax return.  I heard it&rsquo;s in Kenya.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CBS, when you bleep the word &ldquo;mouth&rdquo;, you make it seem so much worse than it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump makes Obama release his birth certificate, then his long birth certificate, then asked for his college transcripts and passport applications. Asking more than any other person running/is president in history&hellip;.while refusing to show us your tax returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is  a petty, unstable, self-absorbed bully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This comment section is funny in a twisted way. A video about Trump doing something absolutely unforgivable and people talking about and there&rsquo;s the group of people going &ldquo;Yea but Hillary&hellip;.&rdquo; But no one was talking about hillary 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i don&rsquo;t understand how trump supporters believe he speaks the truth when there&rsquo;s video evidence that shows him contradicting himself. and every time it is the same excuses &ldquo;someone told me&rdquo;, &ldquo;i was being sarcastic&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are we all this prepared to ignore the lies in this episode?! the log he pulled out was clearly a birch log but the thinker he carved was a dark wood that looked more like chestnut  (not sure but certainly not birch) what happened to the log, Colbert, what are you trying to hide!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is called a &lsquo;gas-lighter.&rdquo;  Taken from a movie. It&rsquo;s about how people mess with others by altering reality and the people fall for it.  They don&rsquo;t believe in their own mind/thoughts, instead. It&rsquo;s something I have been saying all along..  But he&rsquo;s ahead so&hellip;Americans are nutso.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump has dropped the Obama birther thing, because he has discovered that Hillary is secretly a Muslim from Kenya.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did anybody ever tell Trump that religion is not listed on anyone&rsquo;s birth certificate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched this video way too much but it gets better &amp; better every time lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the hell even is &ldquo;israeli science?&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is said that The Drumpf first decided that he would run for president in 2011 after Obama took some very deft shots at him during a White House press corps dinner. The boy did not handle that well that&rsquo;s all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An excellent job as always, Mr. Colbert.

<p>This is the Stephen I&rsquo;ve been missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarcasm, facts, humor and anger.. with a touch of douchy :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But he can&rsquo;t even release his taxes. Maybe it shows something like he&rsquo;s secretly a Muslim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad but many Americans watching this won&rsquo;t laugh. They&rsquo;re called Republicans. Trump may be a lying orangatun, he may be a sociopath, but he is promising lower taxes for the rich. That swings it for them. They will vote Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>such a blatant liar&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. and you still elected him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know bears pooped in the wids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen seems genuinely frustrated in this video. And extremely passive aggressive XP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want too see his tax returns, with all certainty he&rsquo;s hiding something big !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy knows how to screw up other peoples life extraordinary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i really need to see that horse.. :'(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year later, the phrase &ldquo;his biggest lie yet&rdquo; has lost all its meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m half-expecting Frederick the Great to actually be Secretariat, the pantomime horse from Craig Ferguson&rsquo;s show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Cobert nailed this one ok the head! If only more people like him existed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can answer that question.  History repeats itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am sure stephen is gonna get summoned to have a talk with CBS after this..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>But I am hell glad for once in a very long time, stephen has reverted to his old self!! WOOOO!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is easy to predict, he lies outright but he believes his own lies. In his head, he did always support the &ldquo;Obama is American&rdquo; argument, and probably twisted all the history up in a &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t challenge it with all my ability, we would never be sure, so really, I proved he&rsquo;s American&rdquo; logic. He&rsquo;ll likely do the same thing with the 5 million dollar donation. In his mind, he&rsquo;s already donated that, and it&rsquo;s easy to rewrite his memory of events to support the idea that the money was his (even though it wasn&rsquo;t), and that is was because of that promise (which it wasn&rsquo;t).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:50 Bears poop in the woods, not the wids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okaaay, that little segment was from someone saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what anyone says or does to me any more. I&rsquo;m going to speak my mind, and make damn sure that Americans hear the truth, at the least, from a comedian with balls&rdquo;

<p>3:13 I love how he put a white &ldquo;make america great again&rdquo; on the black guy in the back, when the hats are normally red lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen is really pissed today&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;People have birth certificates. He doesn&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo; So, B. Obama isn&rsquo;t a person? Strange times we live in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watch this everyday. Colbert gives me life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the tone I&rsquo;ve been waiting for re Trump coverage. Clap clap!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will somebody get Colbert a mic to drop. Gawdamn!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colbert, thank you. You are the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t! No one knows what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just love the delivery of that line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey Trump : You demanded a birth certificate and got it. Now we demand you show your tax returns. The American people have a right to know what you&rsquo;re hiding. You made such a stink about a non-issue, but your tax return is a valid and very important issue. RELEASE THE FULL FORM TAX RETURN and we&rsquo;ll stop shouting&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen at his best!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Countdown to horse clock&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a lot of letters in that name, it would be a shame if one of them were to go missing&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ucccch I really miss passionate Stephen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last 3 years have really worn us all down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so Savage!😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9:02 The drummer&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;OOOOOoooooOOOOohh!!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is probably my favorite of Colberts segments here on youtube, his responses to everything are hilarious!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added this to my favorite videos list&hellip;he went off lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Stephen, for being a voice of reason in these disturbing times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE, PLEASE ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR A CONFUSED CANUCK: Ted Cruz was born in Calgary, Canada to an American mother and a foreign-national father. Even IF President Obama had been born in Kenya, Canada or EuroDisney, HIS mother is/was American and his father is/was a foreign national. So why was it OK for Cruz but NOT OK for Obama? Does it simply boil down to race?   Thank you for any input.

<p>I want to understand Trump supporters, I really do. I mean, you can quote the man, you can show ACTUAL FOOTAGE of him lying and pulling things out of thin air, you can research and read articles explaining and debunking the things he says, you can hear all the stories of him not paying employees or contractors, and they&rsquo;ll still support him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9/12/2019: I came back for a few laughs. Ever since this was posted reading the butthurt GOP comments never disappoint.</p>

<li>
<p>This is a saver!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the old Stephen Colbert of House Stewart, First of His Name, King of the Satirists and the Fake Neocons, Khal of the Late Night Shows, Breaker of idiots and Father of Takedowns.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>He has won the iron throne at last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was amazing. XD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SMACKDOWN!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hilarious! :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless Stephen Colbert !!!! Respect man for telling the truth !!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do I have to lose respect for all my favorite comedians in this election cycle?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember it one way, and Donald trump is a liar</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Stephen, tell us how you really feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Straight savage Stephen xD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ah, comment section, you never cease to remind me of the low level of life I am forced to share this planet with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump and the right-wing media have done more damage to America than terrorists could ever dream of by creating and perpetuating such a toxic and hateful truth-free environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOVE YOU STEPHEN!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hilarious!!! Thank you, Mr. Colbert!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s really channelling his Jon Stewart in this segment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sweet!  I love when people are both highly intelligent and hilarious!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;And I am a whiner. And I&rsquo;m a whiner and I keep whining and whining until I win.&rdquo; &ndash;Donald (Believe me, it&rsquo;s a real quote)

<p>&ldquo;Hey Probably waiting on that check now, just like all of your contractors&rdquo;  I really don&rsquo;t know how trump hasn&rsquo;t threatened to sue him over the most ridiculous comment ive ever heard.  most savage comment of the decade so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE COLBERT!!!  GREAT SHOW!</p>
</li>

<p>Those poor investigators have been stranded in Hawaii this whole time because Trump didn&rsquo;t pay them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Stephen Colbert!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen, impassioned brilliance ! I think I am beginning to seriously like you )))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>:D .  .  . Stephen, where&rsquo;s your battle ax? Cause that was straight savage!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trump owes obama a small donation of 5 million dollars :)</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>]'[</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ohhhh snaaaaaap Stephen is losing his sh************t and I LUV IT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>took me back to daily show jon stewart days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even Jon-Batiste is like &ldquo;DAMN.&rdquo; Stephen Colbert is so angry and it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great to see the real Colbert we love. Hopefully CBS will let him be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank You Steven.  This is what television was meant for.  Cheers Sir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not gonna lie, I almost died laughing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Colbert gets angry, you know it&rsquo;s about something that really matters and shit&rsquo;s about to get real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Stephen i love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CBS censorship is so heavy, I missed the old Colbert&hellip;&hellip;    ;(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ad before the video was Samantha Bee speaking on the same issue. Awesome!

</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud of Stephen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy shit.  Stephen went in on Drumpf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how he channeled Victor Borge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen is amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He finally hit the meatball!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hint of spite and jeer in Steve&rsquo;s segment today - he&rsquo;s usually full of composure and insinuative with a lot of class. Compared to the previous satires he&rsquo;s done on trump - he&rsquo;s really going all out on this one. But in between the lines of his words he really seems to trying to filter out all that negativity, repressed rage, and resentment he&rsquo;s been holding back throughout the entire election process.  The whole tenor of this feel&rsquo;s so personal and different now - like he&rsquo;s actually unloaded a gun that used to be an empty barrel of humorous threats with several rounds of piercing remarks that define trump&rsquo;s inexcusable actions that&rsquo;s exposed for the fraud he really. The irony is so uncanny. I guess this really crossed the line for Stephen - but i&rsquo;m taking every bit of pleasure and delight in seeing him tear Trump to shreds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAMN!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANK YOU Stephen for telling THE TRUTH!!😎</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legendary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That contractor joke was savage. True but, savage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love you so much, Stephen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;many people say&rdquo; no that&rsquo;s YOU Trump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So so good&hellip;his best yet!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that was BRUTAL :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love it !!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bears poop in the wids???!!?!?! I&rsquo;ve been wrong all this time! i thought it was pronounced WOODS&hellip; dear me. lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, Colbert went in hard on Drumpf!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nailed it baby! nicely done&hellip;

<p>The heat level on this roast has surpassed inferno levels. 🔥🔥🔥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re a genius</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Stephen. Damn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the buuuurrrnnn!!! :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ooh Stephen was angry in this one. You can tell. And rightly so!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen seems to be genuinely mad at Trump&rsquo;s bs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when Stephen used to be funny? Me neither.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Stephen, back at it again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s been over for eight years until Hillary started reaching for straws. I think it&rsquo;s called the death spiral</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG this is gold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen is going full John Stewart in this segment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trump was gonna ad &ldquo;its true, i checked wikipedia!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colbert went full savage on this one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what a time to be alive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes I wish that some of the events in Saints Row IV happen&hellip; mainly the Boss of the Saints becoming President&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Trump says he was the one to finish it, he means he was the last one to realize it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>useless vs useless yeah enjoy your election</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He went in hard woah</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s encouraging to see almost 1 million Views on this segment, far outdrawing network news topics Views</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and those God-awful YouTube sites which pander to a lot of truly disturbed people.

<li>
<p>when are you going to give Hillary equal grill time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAYYYYYYUUUUUMMMMMMM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy Hell. Colbert went all-out.</p>
</li>

<p>HOW DID WE GET HERE????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>steven on fire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bears poop in the WIDS?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know the Emmys are based on specifically submitted episodes, but shit, I&rsquo;d award the Late Show team one for these 11 minutes alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOT &ldquo;The Thinker&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a nickname. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dante&rdquo; lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!!!! Finally someone puts that Cinnamon Hitler in place! He SHOULD be exposed for the fraud he is, but no one seems to have the b-lls to do it, so thank you Stephen! I just happen to love you a little bit more, after this segment! :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine CBS is super thrilled with the direction Colbert is taking the show. But good on Colbert for speaking his mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huzzah for Victor Borge references!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;But&hellip; BUT HILLARY YOU GUUUYYSS!!! EMAILS!!!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t we love it when he goes back to The Colbert Report mode and says things he really means and like he means.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>CBS you have killed half of the genius</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming he&rsquo;s siding with Hilary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that was a different colbert making that statement.  that was a fictive character. !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or his nephew or brother.   i can&rsquo;t really follow.
