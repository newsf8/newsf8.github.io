<p>At first glance, everyone is bored. Then you realize everyone is stoned, and probably having their mind blown at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing what Jimi accomplished on guitar considering he only played for 12 years ( age 15 to age 27 )!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the kids: Jimi plays a right handed guitar turned upside down because left handed guitars were so hard to find at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not showing Jimi Hendrix while he&rsquo;s doing a guitar solo should be a sin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>–ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–æ –æ–Ω —Å–∞–º –Ω–∞—É—á–∏–ª—Å—è —Ç–∞–∫ –∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –¥—É—à—É –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–ª</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think one of the coolest things about Jimi is that if you listen to his music without knowing him, some would probably think he was some punk guitarist who didn&rsquo;t care about shit. But in real life, Jimi was INSANELY polite and humble beyond words. During one show, he actually asked the audience if the music was too loud. In multiple performances, he&rsquo;d often excuse himself and the band while they re-tuned. The man was truly one of a kind!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You realise how much Prince copied Hendrix in certain things after watching this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else is doing rock marathon while in quarantina?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me just being a zoomer and seeing people in the comments who actually went to this thing üëÅüëÑüëÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy died nearly 50 YEARS AGO&hellip;and we all know his name&hellip;talk about being ahead of your time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we just appreciate how he tunes his guitar in the middle of a riff?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know its good when you see 18 different languages in the comment section</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;I guess you guys aren&rsquo;t ready for that, yet. But your kids are gonna love it.&rsquo; :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Beethoven of rock and roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its been 50 years since this Hendrix died but his legacy is going to continue to eternity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw him live, wow what an experiance that was, never anything like him again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The audience was not ready for hendrix&rsquo;s music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cameraman: Oh Jimi is doing a crazy solo? Let me record the sitting audience instead of the guitar god!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He literally could do whatever he wanted with a guitar. Seems like the instrument was part of his body, played with such ease.

<li>
<p>that guitar asked for a cigarette after jimmy was done with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, now I get why Prince wore ruffles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was like a one man carnival: music, spectacle and charisma all wrapped up in one humble but incredibly cool individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The greatest guitarist who ever lived, with respect to all the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:23 two kids with the same striped shirt. Glitch in the matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It amazes me that over 7, 000 people have downvoted this. What is the matter with these people?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi never stopped to play the guitar we love you man üíì</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome.  The most relaxed, &lsquo;no sweat&rsquo; guitarist I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need someone who looks at me like Jimi&rsquo;s guitar looks at him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, he tunes his guitar in the middle of a song. If my guitar detuned while i was playing on stage, I‚Äôd cry like a little bitch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>theres a reaon called experience not band !  as in most concerts  you will hear a band ,  but this  was much more than that ..similar to passing byy a carnival or  actually going inside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was at this concert. I was 17 years old and somewhere in the audience. People were sitting around because this was an all day festival with lots of bands. Very hot also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I quit smoking 20 years ago and now I need a cigarette.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is one of Hendrix‚Äôs sexiest tracks can‚Äôt help but visualize a fine ass woman walking down the street</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete mastery of his instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensacional,  ü§ôüáßüá∑üéº</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the concert that MICHAEL LANG - of the later August 1969 Woodstock Festival  fame - was a part of in it&rsquo;s organization - wow - what a trip !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimmy had so much talent so much Charisma and a lot of energy people said he had very nice personality to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His soul was his guitar, he was always inhuman to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:49 Jimi is performing an outstanding solo there should we show it?

<li>
<p>Nah, focus on the stoned Latino lady slapping her knees next to a cracked open watermelon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My neighbour called the police on me for playing this too loud. They arrested him</p>
</li>
<li></li>

<p>immediately</p>

<li>
<p>Told me I was his FOXY LADY.. MY NAME IS LADY&hellip; LOVES ME MAKING LOVE TO HIM RIGHT NOW</p>

<p>SUPER HENDRIX  üé∏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>September 18 marks the 50th anniversary of Jimi Hendrix&rsquo;s death.   Rest in peace. Sir. üåæüíê</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi was so ahead of the times!  He was a genius!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mitch was a genius, a one man backing track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a guitar be such an extension of a soul as with Jimi. He bent that instrument to his will like no other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi Hendrix didn‚Äôt die, God just wanted guitar lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi was the most awesome guitar player, composer and singer who passed away way too early at 27yo.

<p>He died 50 years ago today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most amazing thing to me about hendrix is the fact that before he came along the most overdriven and distorted sounds in rock came from surf music lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is the reason I wanted to become a guitarist RIP Jimmy 50 years ago today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else came from the joe rogan experience??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, if they ever invent a time machine&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is the greatest guitarist to have ever walked the face of this earth!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:05 tuning his guitar while playing&hellip;what a god.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that the &ldquo;Back in my day we really knew how to party, not like you kids today. crowd??</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>the real father of heavy metal *</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How on earth did Jimi play so many detailed lead parts without looking at his fret board ????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is some free, natural, unapologetic guitar swag right there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a badass guy. Shame we never saw how his music would have evolved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not from this time, bro. Music hasn‚Äôt even progressed to this level of being in tune again since he left</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi&rsquo;s music is timeless. A man way ahead of his time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy shit Jimi has got to be like the coolest person ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The father of electric guitar, we miss you, the world needs you right now Jimi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eu acredito que em meio aos humanos alguns deuses cansados dos seus respectivos para√≠sos v√™m at√© o planeta Terra para se divertir um pouco. Jimi Hendrix na minha opini√£o era um.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 years without the God of guitar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi so fly, he&rsquo;s about ready to fly off that stage with his badass clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know your a cute little heart breaker, a sweet little love maker,&rdquo; Jimmy Hendrix, &ldquo;Foxey Lady.&rdquo;  I know everyone was toking it but, you cannot deny this master of the guitar!  His eloquence cannot be denied!  P.S. This Native here is FOXEY&hellip;speaking of Moi! &ldquo;I see you down on the street, you got to be all mine. I&rsquo;m coming to get you.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi‚Äôs Playing a song most people can‚Äôt play while he‚Äôs having a dance off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi Hendrix isn‚Äôt dead, he‚Äôs just up there giving god guitar lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 years ago we went to the moon.    Hendrix had already been there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how can one man be so intense and so chill at the same time??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we all take a moment to talk about what a beast that drummer is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today is 50 years since God asked him for guitar lessons. Rest in rock legend!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salute to the one and only. Mr. Jimi Hendrix. Ladies and Gentlemen&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>best part of this was looking at the crowd,,,, they didn&rsquo;t realize they were seeing greatness unfold before their eyes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was younger watching him I couldn&rsquo;t understand what was going on. Now watching him at 21 he makes wanna pick up my guitar . üëëüñ§üé∏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mitch michell must be one of the best drummers in history. Hes clearly blasting the hell out of these drums.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever I need inspiration for guitar I always watch videos of legendary guitar players. It motivates me because I know that these people had weren‚Äôt good just overnight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being reborn as one of jimi hendrix‚Äôs guitarsüò®</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gi√† 50 anni senza Jimi&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semplicemente un grande!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Dopo mezzosecolo, siamo ancora qu√¨ a ricordarlo, e fra altri 50 anni, forse saremo ancora qu√¨ ad ascoltarlo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is jamming to this while smoking weed in quarantine?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi Hendrix, the man who made me stop playing the guitar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those looking bored and disproving spent the rest of their lives telling everybody they were there.

<li>
<p>I can‚Äôt hear this song without thinking of Wayne‚Äôs world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to imagine where he would have went musically into the late 70s,  80s &amp; 90s &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear to you if Jimi was alive a little longer he might&rsquo;ve learned to play guitar with his stomach and maybe with no body part at alll. Imagine that  Hendrix just staring at his guitar p,aying Foxey Lady or Purple Haze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today is his 77th birthday, rest in piece legend and happy birthday</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And 50 years later We still miss you üòç Legend of Rock and Roll üôå</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so this is the reasons off all guitarists in the world now its start in this man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Man was truly a heaven gifted Man. Truly left this earth way before his time. Can you imagine what he would have done if he was still alive? Music would be so different. The man was a gift from God. The almighty just wanted him to come back home. WE MISS YOU JIMI!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I played this for my 4 year old grandson &hellip;&hellip;he said at the end &hellip;&hellip;.COOL !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m 16 years old and I&rsquo;m not trying to be one of those kids who acts like they have the greatest taste in music but this performance puts the majority of modern pop music to shame.</p>
</li>

<p>Jimi and band are on a level that has never been replicated. There are some brilliant renditions such as Gary Moore &lsquo;Blues for Jimi&rsquo; and many others, but you can&rsquo;t possibly surpass the ease at which Jimi flails that axe and mesmerizes the audience. The closest I have seen in just pure ability and fluidity is Prince. In their own way they are all great, Jimi and those that pay tribute to him. loved the video, thankyou.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light years ahead of everybody this guy was. True legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. We hear about these iconic musicians from the 60s and 70s, and when I see footage, the audiences are just sitting there. How can they not be rocking out to this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes everyone is stoned, tripping on strong L.S.D. and god knows what else, if jimmy was alive and gigging now, there would be uproar of adrenaline and screaming , pure exstacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My cousin passed away a few years ago and he loved jimi Hendricks his whole life! Foxy lady was one of his favorite songs.I never knew his music till he played it! Wow!Unreal!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just freaking amazing, Jimi was so brave to do what he did at that time period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine writing a song like this and doing the penisguitar  now.</p>

<p>God when ur done getting guitar lessons can u please give us jimi back???</p>

<p>hmm, why does the gig remind me of the scene in Back to Future when Marty McFly rocked the song Johnny B Good &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 Jimi Hendrix. 2 Gary Moore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Mitch sounds like he&rsquo;s just improvising but it still sounds badass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That intro sounds INSANE! Jimi Jimi JImi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi was 27 years of age when he was taken from this earth. One has to presume God was starting up his own band.</p>

<p>Jimi blew my mind as a 13yr old, I dabbled with a ouija board and tried calling him back. Felt the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and not long after, I had a bad experience  and left it alone. Thankyou for the vid.</p>

<p>Jimmy Hendrix The Best! üé∏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today is 18th of September 2020, 50 years from his death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, the entire band was underrated&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could barely avoid bobbing my head. Props (and not) to the audience, lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:44 Jimi in disguise in his own crowd!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drummer is amazing , as good as Bonham , i think&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:08 that microphone holder play the guitar better than me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True story-Jimi&rsquo;s first &ldquo;guitar&rdquo; was a beat-up ukulele with one string that he found in a pile of trash at the age of 14 and to think that it progressed to the greatest of all-time just blows my mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do any guitar players realise were playing the &ldquo;Hendrix chord&rdquo; differently?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There a good guitarists, great ones, godly ones and then there&rsquo;s Jimi Hendrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He s 25 here. I&rsquo;m 24 and haven&rsquo;t accomplished an ounce of what he did. God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The weight of this bass make me feel like a Led Zeppelin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apparently, they are finally going to make a real film about this runaway genius. It&rsquo;s about time, people&hellip;

<li>
<p>Miami 1969, watching the Jimi Hendrix Experience, must have been a trip ‚úå</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point in time Jimi Hendrix was the highest paid musician in the world. He was getting paid more money than Elvis and Frank Sinatra for live performances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else sent this to their crush?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hendrix was, really, THE master of flute. I never had any doubt about it (even if I‚Äôm not musician).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MITCH MITCHELL&hellip; perhaps the most underrated musician of the classic rock era  (Jimi&rsquo;s performance is expectedly incendiary here, too)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we appreciate the bass tone in this version? Sounds sick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice how he rarely looks down at his fingers and strings!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimi Hendrix didn‚Äôt die, God just wanted guitar lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we just appreciate how he tunes his guitar in the middle of a riff?</p>
