<li>
<p>I felt Tiff in this one. This ep is so real and so painful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I just say how proud I am of Tiff and Nikki for being honest about their experiences. It really helps young girls like me who have also experienced some of the same things. IM PROUD OF YALL MAN!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casey&rsquo;s a real one. He knows and understand&rsquo;s his wife&rsquo;s pain and teared up in seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree with Bart that everyone should learn self defense but when your drugged out and unconscious  that shit flies out the window there needs to be a serious shift in how rape cases are dealt with in every country honestly and the emphasis on women should protect themselves should be removed and the education on rape and rape culture should increase, yes everyone should learn to protect themselves but sometimes even that doesn’t help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff&rsquo;s story is arguably the saddest out of everyone in JK. All the shit she went through during her past and looking at her today, and how she&rsquo;s living life now really shows her resilience and drive. I tip my cap to you Tiff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, damn seeing Tiffs face when she said what happened is really gutting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you&rsquo;re drugged you&rsquo;re not able to fight unless you trained yourself on poisons and drugs and they don&rsquo;t effect you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry Bart you’re wrong on this. Self defense isn’t the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is @ the guys but we reallyyyy need to let go of the idea that sexual assault is only ever violent likeeee&hellip;. I think the first step is education too honestly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, Tiffany&rsquo;s rape story was so scary. She explained it so calmly and matter-of-fact-like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bruh age seven my daughter is going in some kind of martial arts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education is key: teaching consent, explaining what constitutes sexual harassment, teaching body autonomy, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>☺️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I’m not that kind of guy so I don’t know” argument gives the same vibe as “I don’t see color so I don’t know about racism”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t stand Bart thinking he knows how everything happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I read a story a few days ago about a 4-year-old girl who told her teacher that her uncle licked her &ldquo;cookie.&rdquo; The teacher thought nothing of it until the mother mentioned the little girl had a rash on her &ldquo;coochie.&rdquo; TEACH CHILDREN BODY PART NAMES.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who ever is dating Anthony Lee is a lucky one. That man is SMART!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broke my heart to see Casey tear up after seeing Tiff play the game</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a victim of sexual assault, it makes me happy to see that I’m not alone yet makes me so sad that we all had to experience it.

<p>Bart needs to stop and listen. He thinks that just because they train, they will not be drugged, ganged on, and targeted. No matter how well you prepare, if you get targeted, you will be hurt. It&rsquo;s a systemic cultural problem, not an individual &lsquo;preparedness&rsquo; issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s depressing those poor women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i get Bart’s meaning upon self-defense&hellip;but him saying these things like how women aren’t “trained enough to use the pepper spray” is outta pocket. how would you train someone to “use pepper spray”? him stopping and listening and UNDERSTANDING the women perspective of walking outside on a day that could be their worst day. props to Joe for elaborating though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony said it better with the analogy similarly to racism people can know about it but people need to be more aware in instances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sad reality is 90 % of the time, the attacker is someone they personally know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bart has a point but it sounds like victim blaming for being too weak to defend themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish more people would speak up when they see girls/women being sexually assaulted&hellip;Like lol it&rsquo;s so sad how people act like nothing is happening smh&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like bart is envisioning a  random guy jumping out of the shadows and attacking a girl and clearly he didn’t digest the circumstances of tiff assault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met a family that allowed shoes worn in the house for more than 2 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I understand what Bart is saying and it makes sense, although, it isnt as simple as that; sometimes/majority of the you need back up (in situations like this and many more).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dude for some reason i got emotional tearing eye and random moment when joe started talking about some wanting to help but they cant because they are scared to step in !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony is one of my favs. Also this episode was so important. I am so sorry about what happened to Tiff and Nikki. Their stories are so important and they’re so brave for being honest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry for every women, I wish this doesn’t happen everyday for y’all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ANTHONY MUTHA EFFING LEEEEEEEE I&rsquo;ve missed him on jknews 😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo! Men with predatory behavior, you might bring a daughter into this world someday and she’ll be dealing with men like you. Be the change, teach your sons, protect your daughters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awww look at Joe and his palm tree hair cuteeee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>firstly, tiff deserves to be commended because it’s extremely traumatizing to not only go through what she did, but to also speak up about it. the way this conversation was handled in this video shows why speaking up can be so hard. tiff, i believe you and thank you for sharing, survivors of sexual assault aren’t told that enough.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Alright, I thought I had heard all of Tiff’s stories. Family member fondling her breasts and her mom not believing her. 😔 Ex-BF engaging in sexual activity while she was sleeping even though she told him on several occasions not to. 😔 Now this&hellip;. 😔😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff did a hella good job explaining all that. Ive only had 1 of these experience and even then trying to explain the situation to people i get so heated and fustrated that i cant do it anymore sometimes but tiff stayed calm and made really good points👏👌💯

<li>
<p>Omgggg I completely relate to TIFF’s thought process.. I tried to befriend and become emotionally attached to my rapist afterwards, because I felt like he owned me, &amp; wanted to trick myself out of the trauma, and idk I was so fucked up psychologically it just made sense. I never told anyone that because it sounds insane, and I didn’t understand why I even did that. When I finally reported it, the authorities didn’t believe me and kind of guilt tripped me for “wasting their time”.. because they thought I was too friendly with him to have experienced such a traumatizing experience. I wanted to kill myself bro. I spiraled. I’m so grateful I survived that time of my life, cause it was DARK. I’m sad to hear Tiff experienced that, but I’m glad I’m not alone with that way of thinking ..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-dense classes won’t help you if you’re drugged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: and the element of surprise is a big thing too, if you’re jumped from behind as a kid or adult you can’t always help yourself. People react differently in the actual scenario</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the attention should be focused on tiff&rsquo;s and Nikki&rsquo;s feelings and experience. it felt like y&rsquo;all weren&rsquo;t acknowledging that enough just my opinion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bart I don’t think you’re understanding, you will never look at your drink to see if have been drugged or looking over your shoulder to see if someone is following you . They’re not attacking men who “don’t speak up for a woman in an uncomfortable situation.” It’s more of educating yourself on those situations and ways to help it or preventing from happening again and letting them why it’s wrong .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bart, just as Tiff said very powerfully, you can learn all the martial arts your heart desires and weight train to the most impressive PRs, but until you are in that specific situation yourself, you will never know how you&rsquo;ll ACTUALLY react. It&rsquo;s easy to say what you THINK you&rsquo;d do, but that&rsquo;s with the mind set you have sitting there thinking of hypotheticals. Just as we teach girls self-defence, we need to teach all students the meaning of consent and how to respect it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad Tiffany cut off Bart with his self defense BS that doesn&rsquo;t help when you are drugged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry but Bart and Joe speaking over the ladies is driving me insane. They aren’t taking the time to listen like Anthony and Casey. They’re listening to answer not listening to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I regret not helping a girl when she was in trouble which led to her PTSD and the worst part is it was my sister. This was when I was younger so I honestly didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Now that I&rsquo;m older and took a few sexual assault prevention courses (course is mostly identifying and preventing an assault from occurring)  if I can physically be there to help I will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19:40 Anthony Lee for PRESIDENT. That conclusion was EVERYTHING.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also, BLESS Tiff and Nikki for speaking out candidly in this group of guys. I can imagine that took a LOT, especially since they weren&rsquo;t surrounded by a group of their female friends who have all experienced similar things aka Big Mood. Extra points to them for really challenging the guys here, that was incredible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All my fingers went down too, everything happened when I was 8 :(. I’m about to be 18 September. The fear I go through is sad but makes me stronger</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And this is where we need to stop toxic masculinity amongst men. Pls just tell us how you&rsquo;re feeling or whats on your mind. Stop trying to have this alpha dominance in front of women AND your friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This made me wanna cry damn🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sucks Nikki and Tiff talking about the shit they’ve gone through somehow turned into the age old “not all men are bad like those guys” argument which yes of course not all men are predatory but we shouldn’t be focusing on that we should focus on what woman go through in their day to day life that dudes just don’t get and talking about how we can make it better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff has it right tho. That&rsquo;s exactly how I feel and It&rsquo;s so hard explaining that to men sometimes and even some women. Thank you Tiff!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14:25 that’s an excuse we need to get rid of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Nikki narrated was a clean example of toxic herd mentality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was only able to realise AFTER the party this was not her fault for thinking that way

<li>
<p>She didn’t expect protection, more like she hoped for it but never got it because her sense of individuality was controlled by the herd behaviour towards what she felt was wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly, ladies, I’m horrified that you were put in a situation that made you feel unprotected. Tiffany was correct. Having the knowledge and being hyper aware is not going to deter a man/woman from causing another person harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing Casey tear up broke my heart so much. I always knew Casey had a very sensitive side and that very moment where he felt Tiff’s pain showed. You can also tell that Joe is hurting for both Nikki and Tiff. Kudos to Joe and the rest of the cast for allowing Tiff and Nikki to share their experiences. Thank you Tiff and Nikki for being vulnerable. I highly recommend watching their Big Mood episode on this topic (Our Experiences with Sexual Assault - Episode 23). Very raw and empowering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m here thinking I’m so lucky I have never experience none of these things, but I just realized I just blocked it out of my head and pretend it never happened to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the point that everyone here is missing is that we shouldn&rsquo;t live in a world where almost ALL women experience these things. We need to be putting pressure on men and making them feel like it&rsquo;s not ok to exist like that rather than placing the responsibility on women to learn how to protect themselves better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thank my Asian parents for sheltering and being on top of my ass for all this time. I’m sorry Tiff and Nikki</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sucks when you put down every finger&hellip; So true and so messed up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was assaulted in the crowd of a school dance when a boy reached up my dress and fully grabbed me and violated me. I tried pushing the hand away but it was so crowded that I could barely turn around and by the time I did I had no idea who it was. But the only boys around me that I could see were my so called “friends.” When I told my male friends about it later that night they were trying to comfort me and one told me I should “take it as a compliment.” Another told me, “shit happens.” When we talk about the men in our lives not being there when something bad happens to us we’re not talking about our knight in shining armor jumping out from the shadows as a big scary man tries to forcefully rape us. It’s about seeing us, listening to us, standing up for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>damn this one hurt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ngl, I wish there was at least one more woman in the conversation for this one. I&rsquo;m proud of Tiff for opening up here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So my dad was a martial arts teacher and taught from when I was little till I was a teen, for a living I have to fight and arrest people (not a cop I arrest shoplifters) so I’m used to fighting. However, two years when I was with my guy best friend&hellip; someone I absolutely trusted I didn’t expect him to keep giving me drinks while he was sober&hellip; I didn’t expect to pass out&hellip; and I was no way prepared to fight when he took advantage of me&hellip; point is I am a trained fighter but in no way was I prepared for my rapist purposely get me drunk and to be my friend. Love to everyone who has ever felt this pain ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize how long yet short this video was, I want moreeee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who else finna cry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Tiffany and Nikki for having the courage to share your stories. There are so many women who have the same stories but don’t have the courage to speak up. ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this makes me soooo sad cos ALL my fingers were put down</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>EDIT: I commented too early&hellip;THANK YOU TIFF!!! She said everything so perfectly about not knowing what to do in the moment. It&rsquo;s not about knowing martial arts cos rape doesn&rsquo;t only come in violent forms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is heartbreaking. The new generation of men need to learn how to love and protect woman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The point is no one should have to protect them self&rsquo;s from being rape. Rape shouldn&rsquo;t happen!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I grew up in Oklahoma in the 90&rsquo;s and rape was SO normalized to me! I look back and think, Jesus, I was raped and sexually abused SO much  and didn&rsquo;t even think about it because it was so normal.

<li>
<p>joe and barts point we&rsquo;re kinda ignorant imo. esp joe saying not all men because no not all men but nearly every woman has gone through some form of sexual assault.. it is no longer an issue of a small handful of men but a culture embedded with power dynamics and normalized sexual assault</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thing that doesn’t sit well with me in this conversation is that with joe saying that cowardly men shouldn’t be held responsible for speaking up for the welfare of a targeted women and Bart suggesting women take more responsibility in learning self-defense, women are still not being heard by the men who claim they are not taking part in these predatory actions. I am so glad tiff spoke so strongly on this subject and that Anthony was there to bridge the gap between what the jk women were saying and what the jk men were saying. Although I wish the jk men said a little less and so that we can all listen and better understand the position that women are often in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve been a JK fan for about 6 years now. I just graduated highschool it’s crazy so see how JK news still has the same vibe and energy as it did a few years ago. They can mess around and have fun and be real asf. I appreciate that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Does your dad kiss you on the lips and say he loves you?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;ASIAN!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bart really is frustrating me this episode. If I get raped it&rsquo;s not because I dont know self defense or because I didnt train how to use pepper spray. If I get raped its NOT MY FAULT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16:19 I understand what joe means, but so many people seem to think that equality means that everyone must share the same hardship and suffering. Why does it have to mean that? Rather than thinking that “well women are equal, so let’s not bother to worry about them being harmed;they can handle it”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we should look at it like “sexual assault, abuse, and harassment can happen to anyone so let’s have everyone’s back regardless of gender and just be more aware and willing to step in and help anyone”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember one of David So&rsquo;s guest in his podcast was a female MMA fighter. She was in an abusive relationship and was made to do things against her will. Then again the abusive partner was also a MMA fighter but I can see  where Tiff is coming from where you feel so helpless where you don&rsquo;t know who to turn to make the abuse stop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will never understand unless you&rsquo;ve been put in the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh this was a little awkward with the guys trying to share their take on it&hellip;.self defense is cool but it wont come into play if youve been drugged. This was the classic women  just want men to listen and men want to try to come up with solutions.  There was no need to defend the good guys who don&rsquo;t rape, they might as well have been saying &ldquo;all lives matter.&rdquo; But i hope they were just playing the role of people who do react like this in order to teach us good things in a bad way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should’ve let the women explain their side more tf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony’s comment on complacency was incredibly enlightening. It’s a very necessary point for these conversations that often gets lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shouldn’t be the WOMANS burden to feel like she needs to learn self defence. People need to educate and reprimand MEN for attacked and being predatory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please parents, as much as you say &ldquo;i&rsquo;m going to train my daughter to protect herself&rdquo; also hold your boys accountable and teach them how to behave and treat girls with respect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the closest thing I can think of what tiff was saying that , is dealing with cops in Alabama as a black man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I commend Anthony for his input at the end of the video (19:40), he is extremely correct and eloquent in saying &ldquo;Our complacency is not enough; and rather, we have to really educate and go the other way in order to make good change.&rdquo; This statement is applicable to sexual abuse, racism and all other causes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe was teetering on a line of normalizing the crowd mentality. I know what he meant, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I agree that bystanders aren&rsquo;t responsible. A girl I knew got totally drunk at a party and some random guy took her home. She ended up hiding in the bed of his truck, but she had no idea where she was and the guy wouldn&rsquo;t tell her or us. He kept saying she was okay, but I demanded he tell us where she was so all of us could pick her up and take her home. It was clear she wanted to leave, but he was trying to keep her there. We somehow we were able to piece together her location from what she could tell us from the outside. I&rsquo;m an extreme introvert and non-confrontational, but there is a responsibility you share if someone is in need of help. To me this falls under the Good Samaritan Law and as cowardly as I am as a person I will go out of my way to help another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though this is kind of a sad episode, I’m glad Anthony is there. Haven’t seen him in a minute.

<li>
<p>Casey got emotional too 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe. You only want to catch them because you know it’s wrong l</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“NOW”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>should have let Tiff and Nikki lead the conversation. Wish Bart and Joe listened more in this conversation and empathised with them instead of glazing over what they said. Thank u anthony for actually doing that!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff mentioned that story before where her sister was the one that gave her molly or something at a rave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BART, not everyone can afford self defense classes or can afford to take the time out of their day to learn such techniques. That is just one part of a safety measure. The bigger thing is to teach children and men how to behave and also to hold those who commit such acts accountable because often they walk free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GODDAMN I missed Anthony so much. Especially now he&rsquo;s someone that&rsquo;s needed on JK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hardly even leave my house and I put every single finger down except two. Makes you think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bart mansplaining and talking from a place of privilege (in regards to getting training for self defense) was honestly really frustrating to listen to&hellip; I love this channel but as Joe pointed out I don’t think they’re going to truly understand until they have a true personal connection to it  ex. Having their own daughter, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart broke with Tiffs&rsquo;s story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the dark side of hookup culture. these are just some of the reasons why conservative ideas on love and marriage are so important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one of the most serious discussions on this channel: Joe’s hair looks ridiculous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gosh, it’s so many stories of assault and feeling isolated in group/social settings. That’s absolutely terrible. It’s evil. Please be safe everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My me too moment was when I was 8 years old my 30 something year old female babysitter sexually assaulted me. You think it&rsquo;s hard to come out about sexual assault? Imagine being a guy saying you got assaulted. I still get some me too feminist saying hypocrite statements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can Bart just&hellip;.. shut up for one second of his life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>edit: Joe too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff is so brave and i’m so proud of her ❤️and i just love how honest nikki Is , they are such powerful women❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg Tiffany explaining how she responded to her assault - I never thought I would be able to put to words and she has.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I’m grateful for this episode

<p>I have a similar thing when I was jogging too. I was visiting a friend in Portland and decided to jog around her neighbourhood. It was around 4pm and the neighbourhood was quiet and serene, until I saw an old van driving towards me. I just had this weird gut feeling, a hunch, that something is not right. Then, as the van got closer, I saw the driver, an older guy, roll down his windows and stare at me as he passed by. He drove extra slow and that was the sign that something is def not right. So I decided to run back to the direction of the house, got my phone out and dialed my friends&rsquo; number. I was remembering the street names and telling her where I&rsquo;m at. Then I looked back and saw the van make a U-turn and I just felt my stomach drop and my heart was racing. I turned a corner and gladly saw 2 older ladies walking their dog. Then I turned another corner in hopes of losing him. So, I did lose him and I just ran back to my friend&rsquo;s house as fast as I can and made it safe and sound. Man, it was one of the few times in life that I&rsquo;ve been that scared for my life. I just bring a pepper spray with me, literally everywhere. Sucks to have to take extra precautions every time but it&rsquo;s the world we live in atm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of this has happened to me, I am young however even thought none of this has happened I am scared of men and guys in general other than my guy friends who I have known for years, I dont know if its because of what other women have been through, or if its because I&rsquo;ve seen men get angry in a place I chipped in to work at and they would get really rowdy when angry, however if you have gone through this, I am extremely sorry that you have gone through that, no woman, man or person should ever have to go through such a horrible thing, and I hope that one day whoever did that to you get what they deserve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out the 10, I still had 4 fingers up. That&rsquo;s crazy! It&rsquo;s so common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update: I asked my mother and she had 5 fingers up at the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We both are not party people, so being drugged would hardly never happen to us, but if we were it could have happened. Thats crazy to imagine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is Tiff able to put her pinky down without putting any other finger down?😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I get what bart was saying but the angle he&rsquo;s coming from, it seems like he disreguards the things that tiff says. It would of been nice if he&rsquo;d listened to her more clearly and elaborate on her ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like this is one of those episodes where the men could have talked a little less and let the women talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love having anthony on!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:25 😂😂😂 That&rsquo;s a very Asian thing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casey is so real. It’s so powerful to see him so affected by these conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lol why is Bart manslaining sexism and fear to Tiff. No thanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tiff and nikki were very open in this i didn&rsquo;t know they went through that. and i think anthony had the best input here i really liked how he expressed his opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s good to have these conversations sometimes regular guys don’t know the situations woman have to deal with on a daily bases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11:30 that&rsquo;s the bystander effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tears in Tiffany’s voice got me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really hope y&rsquo;all talk about what happened to Vanessa Guillen!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, thank you Tiff for explaining how you felt afterwards ( 7:00 - 7:35). After I was sexual assaulted, I felt the same way as Tiff but I didn’t understand why I felt that way. Thank you guys for talking about this topic! (FYI: the Big Mood cast also has a podcast talking about this topic too.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, this is so sad but so powerful at the same time. Tiff and Nikki are so brave and bringing awareness to this problem is a must. The big mood podcast talked about a similar topic, I low-key teared up&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn I felt Tiffs emotions on this one. I love how shes become so confident in speaking her mind.

<p>Never have I ever started on Tik Tok? I thought I heard it before it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg Anthony Lee is back! I love how they still respect eachothers thoughts and views even if they don&rsquo;t always agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I appreciated this meaningful conversation. And would love to see the whole group talk about this. So so meaningful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait use the martial arts narrative when you’re drugged and wasted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it work 🥴</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because from what I know, that’s when most crimes that aren’t trialed happens 🥴🥴🥴</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can we get some thumbs up for nikki being back and hopefully steve soon aswell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There goes bart again, instead of listening he&rsquo;s coming up with a solution to their problems. They&rsquo;re  trying to support each other not become king fu fighters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just came back to this channel after two years. not even half way through it and y’all already makin me happy lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree w/ Bart about women learning some form of self defense. I experienced similar situations, and was fortunate enough to have my best guy friend and god brother teach me self defense at a young age that REALLY helped me down the line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everytime I’m with my friend, she’s always honked at or catcalled. Every single time. What’s sad is that she expects it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember once after school I was on my way to the bus stop to catch my second bus. I was so happy that day because I was bring my parents home a gift. But then a small navy blue car started following behind me and the guy was trying to get me to get in and trying to pay me to be intimate with him. At that moment I became so scared and not only that up ahead where my bus stop was at was a group of grown men who were catcalling me. I was so close into going into an panic attack and crying. After that when I went home I refused to get out of my room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so proud of tiff for speaking out about being raped that must’ve been very difficult to discuss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really appreciate this topic ❤️ thank you for talking about this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I get that Bart is trying to come from a good place, but he sounds like he&rsquo;s victim blaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was followed when I was a kid, he was stalking me in the store and kept leaving when my parents were around and then followed our car when we left. Luckily we were camping so he wasn’t able to see where I lived&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one hurt 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hearing Tiff’s voice waiver made me want to die😭 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope i get atleast one or two boys before a daughter so she’s good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Kasey also teared up when watching Tiff 🥺💕

<li>
<p>I wish I can have conversations like this. I can’t seem to get an honest answer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can someone hit up Nikki and tell her to collab with Brie Larson, now that she has a youtube channel. Idkw but they seem like theyd jell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who also played along and realized that,  all your fingers where down at the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiktok is filled with so much sexism and incels I forgot that there are men who actually care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People seem not to get Bart&rsquo;s points. Systemically, yes, it would be best to educate people on what consent is, how to communicate boundaries, etc., but individually, the best course of action to take is to be self-reliant. Don&rsquo;t leave your drinks out in the open, and if you do, get another one. Practice some form of self defense. At least be familiar with what to do (ex: do not let them move you to another location, you have to fight right then and there or your chances of living/not being violated go drastically down).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guy and I put all my fingers down I relate to all of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m constantly scared to be around men I don’t know especially on elevators I get so much anxiety that sometimes I just freeze up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9:35 YES TIFF SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fact that I&rsquo;m only 16 and had 8 fingers down troubles me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was really traumatizing</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Romans 12:18 God will take revenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That tiktok hit me hard I just had one figure left :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When my younger sister was in high school she went to meet with her friends in the morning to hang out on the weekend for lunch. Three of the guys lived near the meeting place, so they got there first, and four of the girls had to take a while because one of the girl&rsquo;s parents had to drive them there. My sister arrived early as well and they were chatting while waiting for the other girls at the meeting spot. While joking and laughing around, one of the guys patted her on the shoulder normally, but then the second guy patted her back, then the other patted elsewhere. In a split second the THREE of them started groping my sister&rsquo;s breasts, ass and thighs in broad daylight, all over her body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When my friend group  see a girl and she is attractive, we do start conversation within the group but most of the time it is my friends saying go say something to her go up to her and start a conversation. I see this is fine since i see it as a confidence builder but I base it off the setting if it is in a library where students go to eat lunch and take i am not gonna attempt, but if it was in a more social setting i would have entertained the convo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like Anthony and Tiff coordinated their outfits together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video needs a content warning!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Thank you to Tiff and Nikki for sharing their experiences, especially with them being so personal and clearly still traumatising. I wish I could reach through the screen and hug them both. Sending love to them and all my fellow females and survivors 💕</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff 👀👀👀😍😍😍

<li>
<p>I feel ya tiff she should talk more in episodes i like her insight 😊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bart and Joe have a very small mindset concerning these things in my opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That whole escalator thing that antony mentioned was amazing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you ladies for being honest, I too had no fingers left. This conversation needs to keep happening it happens so often that for the longest time I thought it was just a&quot;normal&rdquo; part of life. I have a very similar story as Tiff!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goodness, Bart really missed the mark on this one. The compassion and empathy that Casey showed while  his wife expressed her experiences really shows the type of man he is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A calculated upload for sure, especially on 12:56</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>If you know you know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to feel safe and never get any of these so far in my life but it still got me teared up..I also understand Bart&rsquo;s idea in this since they already did have this conversation before in one of the past video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like they need to do this story with an all girls cast! Cause I would love for the focus to be more on their experiences! Tiff&rsquo;s story and seeing Casey kind of tear up broke my heart!!!! Overall I liked the video and some points made but I would just love to see an all female cast!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tiff story broke me fam 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love that Nikki and Tiff I comfortable enough to speak about their past experiences and to make their voices heard . Sometimes it’s really hard to have conversations like this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I highly suggest listening to the BIG MOOD podcast💓🥺 hearing tiff and the other ladies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casey tearing up for tiff broke my heart 🥺🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think that all of my friends have experienced all of these things by the age of 18 - Thank you Tiff and Nikki for sharing and showing that we aren&rsquo;t alone :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halfway through the video I was like oh shit! Hey Anthony I didn’t realize you were there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love how you guys approached this issue and how Tiff and nikki shared. 💕 Creating a better future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atm I haven’t had anything happen  to me drug wise  (idk about my friends though )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t go out and no car  so I only have 2 (also like do the sexual parts count when ur a kid or just as an adult ?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff it I thought you said you had a friend or sister that did that to you&hellip;&hellip;I still don&rsquo;t think you have a sister.

<p>There’s a reason why I never drink and also if I am going to smoke it’s only with my bf since we go home after</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😢😢😢😢 damn it &hellip;for anyone who is reading this, may you be healthy and healing and may you be free from pain and from suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do remember tiff talking about the drugging in a previous video. That shit TERRIFIES me, not only for my sister but for ALL people in that situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thanks Tiff, for speaking your mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg tiff that was the same way i rationalized what happened to me and I&rsquo;ve never heard someone who had the similar experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow.. it&rsquo;s been so long since we&rsquo;ve had Anthony as a guest on JKN :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably one of the few who have not  been in those type of situations, yet. I only put down 4 fingers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cannot tell you all how much I missed Anthony Lee on jknews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this made me tear up. i’m so sorry that this happened to you and nicki. you guys are so strong. sending lots of love 💕.</p>

<p>This was heavier than I thought it would be, but relatable 🥴</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well than is it good that I&rsquo;m 17 and I haven&rsquo;t experienced any of those things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s heartbreaking to realize that I’m not the only one that’s been raped and sexually assaulted. To know that all these men and women have experienced something so violating just hurts. Yeah we are standing together against this, but the fact that we all went through this really kills me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish things were different</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>still have 7 of my fingers up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is it a country thing?? tf man i live in the sea region but damn america</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL I THINK I JUST DONT DO PARTIES OR OUT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was talking about creeps with my mum and grandma the other day and she said a man was stood at her window and flashed her ? and she was just like ‘oo he must have been desperate’ I was like grandma girl wtf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending love to you Tiff ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony looks like that dude who runs a casino out the back of a Laundromat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man Anthony and his takes this episode👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

<p>I haven’t had any experience like that, so I guess I’m one of lucky ones. It’s horrible that there are others who have experienced this, and how they sometimes can’t do anything or tell anyone, or how some people might be so ashamed they do drastic things..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When tiff and nikki started to tear up, and then casey started to tear up I FELT THAT. I&rsquo;m so glad they&rsquo;re both in better places now!! Casey and Steve seems like real men that love and sympathize with their wives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahhhh finally Anthony!! I missed seeing him haha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My man anthony back!! 👁️👄👁️💢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh the camera is so close up on Nikki and joe, what are they hiding in the table??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tiff and nikki are incredibly brave for speaking out and starting this conversation within the group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a dude and nytime I hear running behind me I freak the fk out.  I got plenty of friends and coworkers that were jumped from behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I once got drugged with a really dangerous mortal rape drug and when I started feeling weird I told my friends I was gonna go home, and I took the subway and walked home all on my own but I have no memory of arriving home. I slept for 24 hours straight and when I woke up I couldn’t remember anything. I was protecting my glass like a good girl but this drug is a powder they blow at your face and in that party people were blowing glitter on each other. I’m so glad I didn’t get  caught by whoever blew that drug on me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there anyone out there that has never experienced these things? I had the realization that I have never gone through any of these scenerios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HEY ANFERNY! I LOVE U GUYS AT JK!&lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a car but I relate to this when sometimes walking home from the bus stop, I tend to put my keys between my fingers just in case I get attacked and its just really sad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My girl friend was telling me how she gave a drunk customer her number even though she was dating at the time and guy friends around us looked down on her so hard&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Even when I told them girls have literally died rejecting men with a legitimate response like “I’m dating”, they still didn’t understand why she would be “disloyal” to her bf, even tho she blocked the Manz number and told her bf about it the minute she was done with work&hellip;. real reality check for me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tiff and Nikki&hellip; thank you so much for telling your stories. You have no idea how much this had helped me. I thought I was the only one who handled the situation the way I did but now I know I’m not alone. This was so healing to me. Thank you so so much. I appreciate you ladies❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this was a damn good video.  Thank you Tiff for being strong and outspoken. Being a lot of our voices and explaining how many of us feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toatally off topic but &hellip;.Bill and Ted❤❤❤ i love Nikki&rsquo;s shirt😅😂😂❤❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was a great episode. I am currently a 30 year old female who has experienced a few of those moments. Everyone&rsquo;s individual background shapes who they are and how they think. I agree and can totally understand all of their points. Everyone and I mean everyone (including Bart) said it perfectly from girls and guys point of view. I loved it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tiff 🥺💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope the guys really took in what Anthony was trying to explain in the end, it&rsquo;s true sometimes when certains things are not happening to us we can&rsquo;t relate to them, sure we understand that it&rsquo;s bad but we can&rsquo;t fully place ourselves in that position to comprehend maybe the nuances of things

<p>ANTHONY LEEEEE IS BACKKKK YESSSSSSSSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was a sad episode of jknews but im glad the episode happened to shed light on this and proves that it does happen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you could literally reverse that for men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im glad that even if i drink heavily i still know what im doing. Some ppl handle drunkness better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well damn Anthony, you finally back!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you tiff for speaking up ❤️ and bart and joe please just try to listen to what the girls are saying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so happy to see Nikki 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey Tiff and Nikki, thank you for sharing this I know it wasn’t the easiest nor will it ever be. I understand you guys felt better about talking about this with your friends but thank you for showing us and doing this. It’s important to for so many reason. I don’t wanna make this hella long but it breaks my heart and I’m so sorry to you and those who’ve gone through the same thing. I was shocked too knowing we’ve gone through similar things and one thing that really stood out was when Tiff was opening up about the guy who she ended up trying to see after the incident occurred just so she can try to make peace in her had about the horrible thing that happened to her. I relate to that very much and felt very alone like I was the only one to handle what happens to me kinda the same way. It breaks my heart. I love you guys so much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is heartbreaking 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love you Tiff and Nikki❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who dont step up when there&rsquo;s a power shift in a situation that makes the other person uncomfortable condemn that type of behaviour period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah I followed along with it and I put almost every single one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s Anthony!!! Guess Covid brought him back to Amuurica, can’t wait for the otr! (edit: this was my reaction to the first few seconds, this is a deep topic that needs to be educated on)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well this brought up some old memories I thought had buried!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
