<ul>
<li>
<p>It should be private. The family doesn&rsquo;t need to be forced to grieve in public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe didn&rsquo;t live a long life but it was fullfilling, it&rsquo;s GiGi that hurts my heart!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bless her heart, this woman and her loss&hellip;it is just incomprehensible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly Vanessa is such a strong women. Losing your husband is hard, but she lost both her husband and her daughter at the same time. I cant even imagine what she’s going through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, this is a tough one to accept. God bless Vanessa, the girls,  Kobe&rsquo;s parents and sisters, extended family, and family and friends of the other passengers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As they should have been. The public is not entitled to a front row seat of every aspect of this tragedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t think we give Vanessa the recognition she deserves for being a strong woman being there for him through everything 🙏🏽 I’m so sorry for your lost 🙏🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHE SHARED HIM, AT THIS POINT IT&rsquo;S ENOUGH..ALLOW HER THIS TIME WITH HIM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to need some counseling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m glad it was private because this is none of our business. Respect to the family 💜🙏💖</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe will never get a chance to walk his daughters down the aisle on their future wedding day but Kobe has walked Gigi down the aisle to God&rsquo;s Kingdom. My heart is still broken RIP 2/24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sad for Vanessa. I can’t imagine the grief. Having to deal with loss of husband as well as the loss of the child you carried for nine months. Two different types of grieving. And she still has to take care of other daughters and help them deal with their loss. Unimaginable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope the millions of people that say they are praying are actually praying. I know sometimes we say that but to actually stop and say a prayer is profoundly needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love it how everyone is showing such respect to this funeral being private. Agreeing that it should be private. Bless those poor families of the Bryant&rsquo;s and the 7 others families. 😥🌹</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My brain still doesn&rsquo;t accept this. I&rsquo;m still living like Kobe is alive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So glad it was private, this is a private matter for Kobe&rsquo;s family to grieve privately, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a spectacle for the world to take pictures and post all over social media and news media outlets. Still very sorry to all the families for their loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Koby was so joyful, and so close to his daughter such a tragedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As it should be. Period. They are all regular people like the rest of us who deserve to mourn and grieve in peace with family and close friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BUT may ALL who passed rest in paradise 🏖🏝🏜⛰🏕🏔💔🙏

<p>The dislikes are from people who were crying so hard that they couldn’t see the buttons. So they accidentally hit the dislike button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s with her Daddy and he’s with his baby girl. The thought of that makes all this just a bit easier🙏🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are in the Kingdom of Heaven with God/Jesus. RIP Kobe/Gianna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was only 13 as my daughter. and so were Alyssa and Payton. 3 beautiful angel princesses, we’re ripped from earth&hellip; I wish People would include everyone lost, when they make their comments . I am torn for the Bryant family,  Altobelli family, Chester family, Mauser family, Zobayan family. 🙏✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>💔A mother; parents should never bury their child(ren).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my Jesus&hellip;. forgive us our sins&hellip;. save us from the fires of hell&hellip;. lead all souls to heaven&hellip;. especially those most in need of thy mercy&hellip;. Amen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa is right about not being able to process the loss of her daughter.  Parents are not programmed to lose their children. It is the other way around. Parents die but not the kids. We know our reality is not made to be easy on us. Hard enough to have lost Kobe, but losing her child , as well, is going to be a difficult road. My heart breaks for her. It also breaks for all these people who were on board the chopper. One girl has lost her sister and both of her parents. How is she going to survive that ? a father of three little kids lost his wife and their mother&hellip;..so much sadness and loss. A lot of pain to process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless Vanessa, her 3 surviving daughters. And Kobe&rsquo;s Mom, Dad,&amp; Sisters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He watched his little girl come into the world and he was holding her close when she went with him out of this world.  I pray for his BEAUTIFUL wife and entire family.  🙏🏀🏆 sending love your way from Wyoming 🥈🏅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still can’t believe that this happened🤦🏽‍♂️ they were all supposed to live until they grow old! Rip to all 9 of them🙏🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If kobe could ..I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d die twice just to let his baby girl live..😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So glad the funeral was private! It needed to be, while people are so quick to make a storyline about this these people are dealing with REAL life. Let them grieve in peace.  This was handle with respect and grace. Still Praying for Vanessa and the entire Bryant family!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so glad she had a private funeral to bury her husband and baby in peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So heartbreaking for a mom to lose her child. Everytime Vanessa posts it hurts my soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe may be laid to rest along with his daughter Gigi but he will never be forgotten even in 2050 his name will still ring bells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least we’ll know who’ll be in the cover of 2k21</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel for Kobe’s parents loosing him twice and this time it’s forever I can’t imagine how painful that is being a mother is not easy whatever the case was he was still her baby I hope to God that he makes them strong and understand the meaning of death.Praying for you the Bryant family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Kobe can go, so we&hellip;. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time &hellip; Set your priorities straight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart breaks to think about vanessa&hellip; There&rsquo;s no words to express how sad this tragedy really is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sad. Remains were totally unrecognisable and mostly charred and disintegration was intense. God Bless the families involved.

<li>
<p>Glad they are finally buried . It dignfies the remains. Now grieving can begin for the family.. I&rsquo;m very impressed with Kobe&rsquo;s amazing dedication to his children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Father and Daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her posts breaks my heart, I have 2 kids and I couldn’t imagine losing them because just the thought makes me feel like I wouldn’t be able to live. My heart goes out to her, stay strong mama!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family wants a private funeral</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ET:reports about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m in tears! This hurts so bad! I&rsquo;m praying for the families who lost their loved ones 🙏💔.R. I. P.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m glad that they got to have a private funeral. They certainly didn’t need their service to be 3 ring circus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P. TO THE LEGEND KOBE, GIGI AND ALL OF THE OTHERS THAT LOST THEIR LIVES. 🙏🏽💜💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe&rsquo;s Smile will be Missed..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad for them that they had a private ceremony . may they rest in peace 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad all over again! I hope we change how we treat each other! It&rsquo;s  Better to LOVE than to HATE!❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope everyone is at peace praying for the bryant family and friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still cant BELIEVE Kobe&rsquo;s gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life can be so unfair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still couldn’t imagine what she’s going through 😥💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It just hurts me to my soul to even realize Kobe his beautiful daughter and others died in a horrible way!!😢 I just can&rsquo;t image how his wife and family feels, it&rsquo;s horrific!!! I hope they all get counseling cause they gone need it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t think the memorial is even warranted at this point . We had him for so many years . We have to realize that public figures are only that public figures . At the end of the day being a fan is highly overrated. RIP to ALL souls that were lost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so happy that this took place without the public’s knowledge/finding out so that they can mourn in peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes. Mama did them proud. Kobe was always a celebrity in life. Having the funeral in &ldquo;private&rdquo; was the right way to go. 💯. R.I.P Father and daughter.🏀🏀🏀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a private funeral was in order.Now TMZ and their wild manner less evil members will not take private pics and plaster them all over the internet like they did with whitney houston

</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad they had a private funeral ceremony. That&rsquo;s something that was good for Vanessa and her family and let them have some privacy for their lost. It&rsquo;s such a heartbreaking situation to not only just lose your husband that you love but to lose your child too at the same time. Their are no words that can explain how heartbreaking 💔 that is 💔 It still breaks my heart to this day. RIP Kobe and Gigi Bryant ❤❤ You will always be loved and truly missed by so many ❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private funeral services is totally their decision. No one else’s. 🙏🏽❤️ That is understandable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank goodness the family held a private ceremony for Kobe and Gigi. I wish this nightmare can go away. Black Mamba lives forever 8:24!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until now i still can&rsquo;t believe that kobe is gone. Man this so hard to accept 🤦

</li>
<li>
<p>Life can end so quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP man. We lost a LEGEND and a LEGEND  in the making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my God this is so painful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mom was saying the other day that if Kobe and Gigi had to go it might have been a blessing that they went together because they were so close that neither one could probably withstand losing the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man i can&rsquo;t&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This brings back the day when my husband passed away&hellip;&hellip;. too many emotions&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time I see their pictures and videos my heart feel really sad ;( hope the mother let father and daughter in the same casket so father can protect his daughter in another world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can still feel a pinch in my heart whenever kobe and gigi are in the news. 😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m thankful they were able to have a private moment. My heart aces for this family.

<p>I believe, we all have our time and place and how we move on (from this earth). They&rsquo;ve all have completed their tasks on this earth and now are living, growing, learning and loving in another higher vibration place.  It&rsquo;s hard I know, but believe&hellip; they&rsquo;re still living, still the same person as they were here on earth. God bless all their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to be so difficult for her team mates to move on!😔😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This seems like so far away. I live in Corona Del Mar and that memorial is outside my community. Rest In Peace Koby and Gigi.</p>
</li>

<p>She is always staring at her phone and giving me trivial news, so I was only half-listening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because I was also playing with our kitten at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then my brain suddenly went into over-drive and I asked incredulously:
