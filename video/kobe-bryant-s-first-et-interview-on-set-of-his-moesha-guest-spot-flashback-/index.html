<ul>
<li>
<p>The body language between the two is so noticeable. It’s crystal clear they were crushing on each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe was a cute guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a woman talks in a high pitched voice around you that’s how you know she likes you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No disrespect to his wife but they were cute together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy was TOTALLY smitten by Kobe lmaooo couldn&rsquo;t even hide it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were dating and rumor has it his parents loved Brandy. They look so sweet here smiling. Both didn&rsquo;t age one bit . R.I.P. Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That little smirk on his face when he said &ldquo;a very friendly relationship&rdquo;. He was a little charmer&hellip;R.I.P to all nine passengers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy seemed so innocent, soft spoken, and sweet back then. Kobe was always a charmer. He&rsquo;ll be missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should’ve got married!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s why positive black imagery is so important. Moesha was a show that helped young black people feel empowered and proud about being black and kept the black men and women attracted to one another! T.V. feeds the mind!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big time 90&rsquo;s feels in this video. Missing those days a lot right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see the Chemistry and Kobe was so fine 😫😳🤦🏽‍♀️💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They both have those beautiful African eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo Kobe was smooooth asff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe and Brandy definitely dated and then some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“He has all the drinks! Sprite, Coke&hellip;”</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>“Is it working?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I STILL CAN&rsquo;T BELIEVE KOBE IS DECEASED &amp; NO DISRESPECT TO HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE, VANESSA BUT BRANDY &amp; KOBE&rsquo;S CHEMISTRY IS VERY NOTICEABLE &amp; CUTE IN THIS OLD VIDEO &amp; RIP KOBE, FOREVER A NBA LEGEND, GONE TOO SOON!!!!😭😢😓

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a kinda Tupac look to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s who he should have married. They made a BEAUTIFUL couple!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every girl from LA was rooting for Brandy &amp; Kobe after he took her to prom 😭 they were so cute. RIP Kobe 💜💛💜💛😔🏁🏁🏁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy, thank you so much for introducing the world 🌎 to such a wonderful man!!! RIP KOBE!!!!😢😢😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:16 “I’m more experienced 😏” Kobe think he slick 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He really didn’t age at all lol black don’t crack fr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were super cute together. I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s like a bad dream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s like they had a hidden language that nobody knew but them ! 🤞🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn brandy was only 17 and Kobe was 18&hellip; Man good old 90s.. 90s were good times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God he was so good looking. Such a shame we couldn’t see him grow into a handsome old man 🥺 R.I.P good sir 🙏🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looked nice next to an African American queen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it just me or did he look abit like Pac!?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The league didn’t want Kobe with a black woman, period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy was in lovvve and so was Kobe. So innocent and sweet. It would’ve been beautiful to have seen those two married. RIP Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy lost a lot people on that show 😢😢😢.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all can’t tell me Kobe wasn’t SMASHING😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe&rsquo;s real first girlfriend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can tell Brandy is more media trained/experienced then Kobe here because he is gives everything away when asked questions about them.  He was really into her cool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy is so beautiful.  I realized how close she and Kobe were and they&rsquo;ve know each other for a long time.  I know she must be hurting terribly right now, and hope she can find peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has nothing but love in her eyes.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn’t know Brandy and Kobe dated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These two would’ve made a cute couple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy is crushed right now&hellip;.They were really close friends. I don&rsquo;t think she is ready discuss about losing Kobe right now. It is going to take time to process this all in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chemistry between them was so  beautiful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember her cheering him on in the dunk contest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was so cute wow. Kobe face expressions  and brandy aww that was really cute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was so gorgeous, the smile, TV the eyes, his voice, everything. Just a beautiful person inside and out. Also he reminds me of Tupac. He has some kind of arabian vibe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy and Kobe need to get a room here.. Brandy is sooo in love with Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when she said “yeah it’s working” , you could tell how much they liked each other when she smiled so big @ 3:43. awww 💜 r.i.p. Kobe 💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would’ve been nice for him to have been with Brandy to see him with a beautiful black woman nothing against his Wife just saying it would be nice to see more of our talented black Men with with our talented Black woman ❤️🙏🏾RIP Kobe and Gigi from your loving black sista</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They both are in love and it shows they both were.Those smiles never went away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy can’t even do the interview. He is having problem forming a question? Kobe and Brandy were so cute together. Things might be different if they ended up together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i feel like he was doing a lot more than acting on set, the way Brandy looking at him&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ohhh she liked him, her face her voice it all showed it haha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This made me smile. It helps but it&rsquo;ll take time for me to heal. You can never take away our memories of Black Mamba. The man said it himself heroes come and go, but legends never die. He was right. R.I.P to Black Mamba, Mambacita and the other families as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was crushing hard on Brandy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They went to prom together and brandy was at the 1997 dunk contest cheering her friend on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sad. Prayers to his wife, kids and family and the families of the victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you know&hellip;this is when I first figured out who kobe was. I&rsquo;m 6 years younger than kobe and had a mean crush on brandy back then and I got jealous af when i heard she was taking kobe Bryant to the prom and I was like &quot; who tf is kobe bryant, I never heard of this guy&rdquo; so I watched a game and I was like &quot; damn he&rsquo;s good&hellip;.i see why &quot; and after that he became my hero 😔😢 r.i.p. Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro they look fine together.

<li>
<p>I remember when him and Brandy dated briefly!&hellip;&hellip;Rest Easy Kobe as well as his daughter and the other passengers!❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was crazy handsome when he matured (over 40)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s crazy how when some people age they tend to get more attractive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually looks tend to go down hill</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way he looks at her. 🥰🥰🥰🥰I like brandi better then Vanessa for him, 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Brandi was his first LOVE. 🥰😘 i watch this over &amp; over again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They made a cute couple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s here Hakeem accept for the part where they like each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and him being broke😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gianna looks just like him omg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:33 “you only live once”  and Kobe your 41 years on Earth were Legendary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They was crushing on each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personally I would have married Brandy and called it quits. Her voice, smile&hellip; damn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They would’ve been a cute couple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They really liked each other ! That was super cute ! 🙏🏽All respect to his Wife and family! RIP</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>He was just as happy and handsome had he wants to be ! He was very very intelligent!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy still look the same, FLAWLESS! 💙</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe will definitely be missed&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know Brandy and Kobe Dated that&rsquo;s so great. Is it just me or does Kobe kind of favor Tupac?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe was very Smart and Intelligent. They looked so cute together.

<p>Damn,</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Who would of thought. My buddy, Lou, on the set said afterwards that Brandy called him Kobe-licious, the rest has become history. Very tragic to think of it, now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Him and Tupac had an uncanny resemblance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He kinda looked like 2 pac</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man i just noticed how he look alike 2pac</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy was looking at him only how friends with benefits look at each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They had that puppy love. They were so cute. RIP Black Mamba and Gigi!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somewhere in an alternative universe Kobe married Brandy and had kids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They look like a couple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You wanna see the definition of the word « Love » ? Look at Brandy’s eyes !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She literally described his career! You can do it again and even better! Wow!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he asked about dating K.B was all smiles and they was crushing super hard !

</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe had so much swag at such young age.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Damn I love this. Wow how the hell did they not get married? Am blushing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at Kobe&rsquo;s face when the reporters asked if they were dating (2.04) too cute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That boy was smooveee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was during the times when black men dated people who reassemble their mother. The 80&rsquo;s-90&rsquo;s were the best times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He really looks like Gianna here. 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:05 the look he gave her ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like Tupac</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow he was really sprung. They would&rsquo;ve been such a beautiful couple. Not that he and Vanessa weren&rsquo;t. RIP Kobe &amp; GiGi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They definitely would&rsquo;ve been relationship goals along side jada and will, bey and Jay, Michelle and Obama, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KOBE WAS THE MAN! HOW CUTE IS THIS?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe’s parents loved the hell out of Brandy and they wanted him to marry her 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wow .. It seems like they might have been each other&rsquo;s first love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy sounding like Whitney. Rip Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A young Kobe and young Brandy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cute Couple.</p>

<p>Kobe could have been a great actor if he wanted to be.  He had connections as early as his rookie season with Moesha aka Brandy.  RIP mamba, ladies&rsquo; man Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is giving me Whitney Houston hear with her voice.  This is a cute interview and Kobe is very charming.  Sleep peacefully Angel!  Thank you for leaving a peace of you with us forever!</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Mamba got a 2pac look going here. LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should’ve been together</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe should&rsquo;ve got with brandy .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was banging that heavy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg brandy was a barbie doll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legend. Brandy is such a lovely soul. They would have worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thats right, Brandy was dating Wanye from boys 2 men, thats why they probably didnt date each other like that&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they both get married anyway cos they looked good together am just saying.

</li>
<li>
<p>Aw brandy 🥺 she’s liek so smitten she must be sad and this is so sad seeing his first interview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How sad 23 years after this he is gone. Life is short and untrustworthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brandy it&rsquo;s written all over your face, you don&rsquo;t have to say a word🎶🎶🎵🎼 lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought him and brandy made a cute couple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They really liked each other awww</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t things go further with them? They looked really cute together and had good chemistry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s weird now I can’t watch these videos of Kobe without getting teary eyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P. KOBE and GiGi. He aged Gracefully. Go look at Kelly Clarkson when he meets coach that&rsquo;s been diagnosed with cancer and his basketball team. R.I.P. TO all those beautiful ppl.on that helicopter. So sad so sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe was a handsome guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P legend</p>

<ul>
<li>Rest in peace Kobe and Gianna, and the other along the flight!</li>
<li>A lot of people who starred on that show ended up passing away&hellip;I’m starting to believe that show was cursed&hellip;.</li>
<li>Can you imagine if these 2 married one another instead of Vanessa?  I believe he&rsquo;d been happier, only because they were on the same level, same status from when they met.  She was a star he was a rising star</li>
<li>I always thought Brandy and Kobe should of been the couple meant to be.</li>
<li>Back then he said &ldquo;naah that&rsquo;s not my thing&rdquo; but unfortunately for Shaq and Jordan they didn&rsquo;t won an Oscar&hellip; You did Mamba. RIP</li>
<li>To all those people in the comments saying this video is disrespectful to his wife, no it&rsquo;s not.. most people over the age of 28 know they dated forever ago.</li>
<li>His wife sat at his press conference by his side when he admitted cheating on her. That didn&rsquo;t bother her why would this ???</li>
<li>Interview questions were lame!  They look like a couple.</li>
<li>Kobe was smashing lmao 😂</li>
<li>I remember he took her on his prom at lower Marion high school! but I don’t remember this episode. This is just devastating!</li>
<li>They totally dated back in the day maybe they weren’t in love but they had an appreciation for each other</li>
<li>Mans interviewing sound like Dj Vlad lmao</li>
<li>Man, sparks were totally flyin&rsquo;</li>
<li>If only he would&rsquo;ve kept driving in limos</li>
<li>Wow, they had great chemistry really, no disrespect to his wife but there&rsquo;s something about black love, I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s true.</li>
<li>He was so cute.</li>
<li>When I first heard bout Kobe my first thought was him denying that relationship he had with brandy 🤦‍♀️Stevie wonder seen that chemistry</li>
<li>Black men are beautiful</li>
<li>He was the 1rst person they came to for the lead role in &ldquo;He Got Game.&rdquo; He turned it down to focus strictly on basketball. Ray Allen was the 2nd person they went after and the rest is history. I would have loved to seen Kobe play Jesus Shuttlesworth.. But Ray Allen did his thing and Denzel was amazing as usual.</li>
<li>
<pre><code> Kobe understood what was more important to him at that time.
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>You know they smashed</li>
<li>So innocent.  They genuinely liked each other 😥😥😥. We will miss Kobe Bryant</li>
<li>Its weird and I know how blasphemous this is, but to me life started over again after Kobe died..</li>
<li>Kobe love to act he&rsquo;s into everything.  He looks great with Brandy.  Kobe was into her and she was into him.  They made a beautiful young couple.  Great to know Kobe can act too!   Very nice, nice work and he&rsquo;s very comfortable being in front of the camera.  Kobe is not shy about anything and that&rsquo;s why he is such a success on the basketball court.  Great job Kobe! I&rsquo;m loving this.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s crazy because when I found out he died I thought of brandy rip to him and his baby girl 💜🌹🙏🏾</li>
<li>I thought they made a cute couple. I thought they would had stayed together!</li>
<li>The passing of kobe brought me here. I&rsquo;m 51 so I&rsquo;m old enough to remember him dating brandy.  RIP kobe rest in power🙏</li>
<li>LMAOOOO damn brandy was smitten it was weird.</li>
<li>Much respect to his wife, but you can feel their chemistry throughout this entire interview. R. I. P. Black Mamba 🏀</li>
<li>He even sounds &amp; looks the same 🥺💔</li>
<li>Kobe was a straight baller in everything huh?😂 RIP Kobe</li>
<li>Bless his heart Kobe and Gigi 😭💜🧡</li>
<li>This is the cutest interview ever. Kobe had so much swag that at 18, even the reporter was getting choked up over him</li>
<li>Kobe literally was the Tupac of basketball</li>
<li>The look on Kobe&rsquo;s face when she shoots that ball 😂😂😂😂😂</li>
<li>They were so in love 💜💜💝</li>
