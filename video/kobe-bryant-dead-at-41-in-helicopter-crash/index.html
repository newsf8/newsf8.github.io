<li>
<p>Rest in peace to him and condolences for all lives lost.</p>

<p>I remember when juice WRLD died. We were all like “whose gonna die in 2020” I bet none of us will expect it to be kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive. Never surrender.&rdquo;</p>

<li>
<p>This is so humbling. Tomorrow really isn&rsquo;t promised to no one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me : 2019 was a bad year for me, I hope 2020&rsquo;s gonna be better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 : Iran and U.S tension</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me : maybe it&rsquo;s gonna be ok?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 : Australia suffers from major forest fires</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is to shorts to have grudges💯 prayers to Kobe Family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually get too sad when a celebrity dies, but Kobe and his daughter&rsquo;s death hit different</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My prayers are with Vanessa, may Gigi and Kobe rip. This is so devastating, mamba will live on forever.😔🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P to all five souls that perished. It just goes to show that death does not discriminate&hellip;..whether you’re rich or poor, black or white, we all end up in the same place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s happening to are world we are losing so many good people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yelling Kobe after throwing stuff with my friends ain’t gon be the same no more 😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worst thing about this tragedy is his wife who had to take the news of her eldest daughter dying. I&rsquo;ve had friends of mine mothers lose their daughters and a mother is never the same again it is the saddest thing about this whole incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She lost a lover and one of her children I can’t imagine the grief of his family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gigi friend + her friends parent + pilot were among the other 3 whom passed from what I’m understanding. Prayers for them all. I couldn’t imagine.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>750 million dollars and fame can never guarantee your life. When the Almighty calls you, you have no choice. I hope he had made peace with the Almighty. It&rsquo;s so sad also because he was only 41 years old and that is still too young to die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To God we belong to him we shall return RIP 😔

<p>2020 is going to be good they said, ( possible war with Iran, bush fires that’s killed over a billion animals, the coronavirus, and Kobe’s death) all within one month!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’know, I’ve never been into basketball, but this, this is depressing. Even if I didn’t care for the sport, I still had to respect the man, and I will from this point onwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was this really an accident is what i’d like to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip kobe and gigi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, prayers to that kid (gigi&rsquo;s friend and team mate) and her parent and the pilot. This is just tragic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its times like this when I dont like hearing the word &ldquo;dead&rdquo;. Sounds so insensitive. How about saying &ldquo;passed away&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone said that a famous person will die. We all thought it was gonna be the queen. But, it was our legend, Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m at a loss of words, RIP Kobe. One of the greatest to ever do it 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP kobe and his daughter, Gone but never forgotten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May his soul rest in peace  great Legend💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His poor wife&hellip;. I can’t imagine how she’s feeling rn.. 💕 👼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His soul still remains in our hearts. He and his daughter are both playing on the heavens team. R.I.P. Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This decade is insane already and its still January</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feelsbad for the other people that died with him cause they dont get acknowledged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Legends fall in the making” R.I.P Kobe, and his daughter Gianna, they’re in a better place now, make sure you score as many freethrows as you wish up in paradise! RIP Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip Kobe and Gianna you will be Missed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoyed the journey Mr Bryant&hellip;tell our father I said hello.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that the situation was not under his control, makes this even harder the wrap my head around the news! I can only imagine how helpless kobe felt when the helicopter was going down, and the fact that his daughter was onboard with him makes it again even worse.😞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow so sad he is so young. I can&rsquo;teven imagine how his wife n daughtersfeel right now&hellip;may he rest in peace🙏💕

<li>
<p>I feel bad for his wife and daughters. I was at the bar when I went to CNN.com I screamed &quot; OH SHIT&rdquo;.  Everybody there went straight to their phone.  R.I.P to the nine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever I think about Kobe I think about his legendary work ethic.</p>
</li>
<li></li>

<p>He inspired me to grind and work harder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP
