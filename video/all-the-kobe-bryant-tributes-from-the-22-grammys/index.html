<li>
<p>Just the fact that like a day earlier,Kobe Bryant passed the torch to LeBron James after he passed him in points&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..R.I.P. Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No more &ldquo;Kobe!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>but: &quot; &hellip;.For Kobe&hellip;.. &quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moment you give up, is the moment you let someone else win&rdquo; ‚Äî Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry because it&rsquo;s over. Smile because it happened. I&rsquo;m smiling with tears because I&rsquo;m happy, that Kobe existed in this world. He lived for greatness.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Thank you God, for allowing Kobe to exist. Don&rsquo;t know why you had to take him so soon. But only you know. Thank you for making a wonder human being, here on Earth. Thank you&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did the grammys put this together so quickly? He literally died the same day this aired that night</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t forget the others that died wit them are as important as Kobe and his daughter. Prayers for those who are family and friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe would want everyone to honor the star that is his daughter more than himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will never forget the quote Kobe Bryant said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the next Michael Jordan, I only want to be Kobe Bryant.&rdquo; Kobe Bryant was always humble and one of the best mentors the sportsbooks have ever seen. Thank You Kobe&hellip; You&rsquo;re a real one üòá üòá R.I.P. G.O.A.T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sad that no one mentions the other 7 people that died. üò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hope his wife has good people around her, the vultures are out in full force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had two friends die this past year suddenly, both were dad‚Äôs. They weren‚Äôt heroes or famous like Kobe was but they were heroes to all that loved them. Having Kobe die with his daughter brought up the memories of their deaths especially of one of them cause he was a huge Lakers and Kobe fan. His wife wrote on his Facebook about loosing another great and hoped he‚Äôd be at the gates of heaven to great him. We don‚Äôt expect to loose people so young. There‚Äôs so much hate in this world. You never know when your going to loose someone you love or care about, life is too short to hate so much. Remember to keep in touch with friends and family, you never know what tomorrow brings. You don‚Äôt want to live with the regrets of what you could have said or done. Life is tough enough for everyone, stop hating so much. My friends were 40 and that‚Äôs too soon to be gone, just like Kobe. Don‚Äôt wait until their gone to realize how important they really were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why it‚Äôs always like this, sacrifices like Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, etc&hellip; and now Kobe Bryant died right before grammy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is too short we never know what‚Äôs gonna happens next that‚Äôs why we live our life to the fullest Kobe,Gigi and the Rest of the Victims of the crash Rest In Peace You are all in the arms of Our Dear Lord You are all gonna missed‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the generation that hollered KOBE every time we threw a peace of garbage away &hellip;. don‚Äôt stop doing that

<p>A Goat is always a Goat. Greatest of them all. Gigi was too young and Kobe was too amazing. The thing is this happens all the time with regular people. Normal people die all the time.

<p>He is just so many steps higher then us as always but I am still crying inside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This almost made me cry!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate the times we had with him, those golden years of basketball he brought for us. Kobe lives energetically inside our hearts, we haven&rsquo;t forgotten about him, he hasn&rsquo;t truly died, and he will never. A great man with the heart and mentality of the world. Even his opponents couldn&rsquo;t help but love him, this is when you know you&rsquo;ve met a wonderful man indeed. Gigi is a beautiful, young girl overflowing with talent. Kobe is still teaching Gigi in peace, carrying her, helping her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are praying for all the Bryant family I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss my the Rest In Peaceüíúüíõ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This death makes me think about life. He lost his baby girl and that coach lost his baby girl and wife</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know Kobe is dead and everyone‚Äôs talking about him but one of his numbers was 24 and his daughters number was 2 that equals 26 and it happened on the 26th

<li>
<p>Yes it&rsquo;s going to make them all think twice about a Helcopter and plane, him and Daughter other 7 is Truly in a BETTER PLACE but he had a wonderful life, keep the family in perfect peace jesus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe is the best. This story is still relatively early in the situations development but I&rsquo;m troubled by the reports I&rsquo;ve been seeing about the incident. The weather conditions and visiability were pretty bad from what were seeing reported and they were so unfavorable the sheriff&rsquo;s department had grounded all of there choppers. So this has me going around in my head, there were 7 other people on that chopper who died a tragic death that could have been avoided had Kobe driven instead. The 7 others dead all have families too who are in mourning now seeing Kobe Bryant idolized after leading these u other people to there death.<br>

<p>I was born in 97. I started to watch him 00 or 01. I was alive throughout his all season in the nba. His the reason why I picked up a basketball and watched it. 3 peat with shaq. 2 peat with Gasol. 06 81 point game against the raptors. Tapping his finger and finishing the game. Him scoring his free throws with a torn Achilles. Off the court: the business him and his wife created. Him winning the Oscar. Him doing all those charities. Him building the academy that his daughter played in and he coached. Did the make a wish. He was my mike growing up. Basketball isn‚Äôt the same without him. Don‚Äôt forget Kobe scoring 55 points against mj, when mj talked trash to him.</p>

<p>Ah yes. The coveted celebrity opinions we all need to hear to make sense of things. RIP Kobe and Gigi. You were truly a hero to me. Picked up a ball because of you and enjoyed my youth so much more thanks to your shining greatness we could all feel. I never got to see you play in person but I feel like you were a part of my life for so long. I&rsquo;m all cried out. Strength the the Bryant family. Bless your souls!</p>
