<li>
<p>It really looked like a medical issue. Not buying it..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Um no something was clearly wrong with him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy it. Seacrest is 100% on point 100% of the time. That didn&rsquo;t look right, and it&rsquo;s concerning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan needs a vaca he’s been grinding since 98.7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He works a hundred jobs.  Travels a lot, diets, exercises.  He makes millions  as a single guy.  Take some time off and enjoy your life.  How many millions does one need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He totally stroked out&hellip;He’s hiding it because of what he said about being afraid of losing gigs&hellip;Poor guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We the people recognise when something is not right physically with others, and that&rsquo;s why that PR statement is a lie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That statement is such BS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan Seacrest is the hardest working host on television!!! He should take a well earned vacation&hellip; the guy is everywhere!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nope. 100% something happened to him. Migraine, stroke, tia, something. He needs to slow down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like a Transient ischemic attack, which technical is not a stoke.   Just a warning of one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is he still chasing? His dreams, money, fame? Slow down and let someone else have a few of those jobs. Ryan is not the only good host available. Can&rsquo;t enjoy your life from a hospital bed Ryan. So much money. So little enjoyment of his riches. Smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine people just being like &ldquo;Hey you look like you&rsquo;re having a stroke&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pfffft Thanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His clone is malfunctioning, eye goes black.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is afraid for his career and doesn&rsquo;t want to appear sick. He needs a complete physical as he more than likely had a TIA, a precursor to a stroke.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is either a stroke a light stroke or he had a bad migraine I have seen this before first hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly hes a robot, and was malfunctioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nah something happened..

<li>
<p>He looks like a younger David hasselhoff, if that’s how his name is spelt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He needs a HOLIDAY! Let the man rest!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is someone holding a picture of Ryans picture next to Carsens head, kinda unnecessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shape shifting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being exhausted can really make a person look out of it. He needs to sleep for a week straight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is everyone ignoring the fact one eye was totally different color</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was probably tired being on for several hours straight. He prolly also dropped an edible  or something. Started tripping out a lil! Haha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seriously tho, hope he’s okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait what&hellip; there’s not even a part where “Ryan Seacrest responds” like the title says! lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year in January I had an Ocular Migraine for the first time in my life. These are similar to migraines with aura and they are debilitating and cause dizziness, confusion, nausea, and partial blindness. That OC i had was accompanied of atypical aphasia and when it happened I though I was having a stroke. It was very scary and I ended up going to the ER but they were able to diagnose the OM. It still frightens me to think of that moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hope he got this checked out by medical doctors, and also COVID19 testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coronavirus can cause neurologic symptoms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s doing too much. Ryan it&rsquo;s okay to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a couple of things. Nothing can replace good health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MK Ultra affects one eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frequency is rising 🔥🔥🔥🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🧬🧬🧬 DNA is reactivating all 12 strands. Most elites and celebrities can’t vibrate at this new frequency, it’s all falling apart—the media. Everything! ❤️❤️❤️ We have a chance to create a new earth where we can restore nature to this realm!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pupil looks dilated. maybe eye migraine from stress??  I&rsquo;ve had that, my vision was like shattered glass for a while then resolved after a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a long time I noticed he has lazy eye maybe he’s exhausted  stressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translation : “he had a stroke”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would he deny having a stroke? How do y’all explain that then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan suffered some type of a stroke !! It was DEFINITELY s severe medical issue!!

<li>
<p>Now just for a moment, Seacrest out!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xanax kicked in😨😨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is bs. Something happened to him, probably a tia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending him lots of love!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a panic attack??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RYAN SEACREST USED BOTOX AND MESSED HIS EYE UP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>did he just say national geogra&hellip;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol &ldquo;work home balance&rdquo; he was drunk, obviously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy is one of the hardest working people in show business. He is constantly doing something. He needs to tone it down and take his health seriously. Take some time off brother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Henny hits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t just get one of your eyes half the size of the other over stress, this is something medical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude, stay safe&hellip;you owe me 12$!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That statement is pure PR. He definitely had some kind of medical event - but it&rsquo;s none of our business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was most definitely a Transient Ischemic Attack. Hopefully he gets that checked out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan, is so sleepy! He has to get some rest in between! 😴🎶🎤🎶</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American idol is still on? I thought it ended in like 2008</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mini stroke or a panic attack I had panic attacks that make me seem that I’m acting weird</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hope he okay - I&rsquo;ve seen a stroke firsthand (well it&rsquo;s after effects) and it&rsquo;s not a good thing.  Something is quite off with Ryan Seacrest and I hope he stays safe.  Thinking of you at this time, Ryan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like sleep deprivation to me. It could lead to stroke like symptoms and he needs to catch up to sleep debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get we papa Ry ❤

<li>
<p>Maybe there was something wrong and his rep didn&rsquo;t want him to share? Because it might affect his job? Idk. Still horrible, but not impossible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boy off the perc it make u do that. Especially when you gotta itch your stomach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something was off for sure and I hope he is well and rested .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best wishes to you Ryan and we want you back healthy and funny as always ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>270th!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had bells palsy strike me at work&hellip;..and let me tell you, it felt like a stroke. It certainly made my left side of my face stop functioning properly. My speech was slurred&hellip;I was disoriented.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Just putting that out there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I saw the video I got sooo worried for him. I’ve actually met him a couple of time (when does his rounds at children’s hospitals ) and he’s always so nice. And I listen to him every morning on his radio show. I truly hope he’s ok and get medically checked and they’re not just pushing this under the rug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who has done public speaking can attest that these types of imbalances can happen from nerves and energy level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh he&rsquo;s just really high</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did he get 2 different eye colors?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didnt even know American idol was still on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adrenochrome withdr&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could have been a panic attack 🤷‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like he got high during break&hellip; no problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drugs, stroke or straight up exhaustion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so bad for him. He won’t admit it so he doesn’t lose work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lies you tell! That is a stroke or some other serious medical issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When is enough enough. How much $$ does one person need??

</li>
<li>
<p>Poor thing got so tired and burned out he like microslept on tv</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think he needs rest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soon it will really be Seacrest Out if he continues down this path!😩</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s drunk af</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like he had Bell’s palsy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praying for him!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else got a migraine med ad?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually thought he was struggling to read the information, and not wanting to experience what happened to Steve Harvey&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glad to hear he&rsquo;s okay. He should take it easy though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was definitely more than needing rest. Some kind of Neurological event no doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seacrest out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t want to see him “Seacrest out” for the final time on live tv. Just an awful thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ummm his eye and speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a migraine while trying to read?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you are the biggest phony of all time!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s time to retire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So how you know what he does behind closed doors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks more like Bells Palsy. Something im very familiar with myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah okay &ldquo;Vince ShamWow guy&rdquo; what did you do with Ryan?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s high AF what do you expect

<li>
<p>It looked like migraine eye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+09</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could he have had a stroke in his optic nerve? I think that&rsquo;s a thing, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drunk?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over tired and or bombed&hellip; he’s been overworking himself for quite some time so I wouldn’t doubt exhaustion added to whatever it was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could’ve also been a panic attack. When I have panic attacks formulating sentences and my words slowing down is very common. A panic attack does seem logical due to all the stress he’s under.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s looked sick for awhile now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s exhausted</p>

<p>He was High off of the gunga, weed/Marijuana. Duh! He hit a Blunt. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s always Happy!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🥴</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Drunkiessss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I get migraine headaches my words get scrambled. It looked like he was fatigued &amp; going into a migraine episode..he may not even get migraines, but it&rsquo;s what it looked like to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also look at pictures and videos of him his right eye is smaller than his left. Most people have one eye bigger than the other or at least a lot of them do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something was medically wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I heard krlly is going somewhere else !</p>

<p>I respect that no matter what happened here, he powered through it and finished. But I do hope he gets checked out and get needed rest.💙</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maybe he was clenching a fart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought he was drunk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mini stroke?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how the &ldquo;handlers&rdquo; will say anything to convince people that there is nothing wrong. Come on guys Ryan is human and no matter how well he takes of himself he could still have a stroke. Thake him in for all the tests please. &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask what he feels like after he gets robbed and burned out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like he had a mini stroke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks as if he is coming down with Bell&rsquo;s Palsey ..probably due to stress&hellip;I had it severely 9 years ago and still have small discrepancies in my face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah no something happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He totally had a TIA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Umm so no one has ever had a drink before?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like.the oxycodone just hit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess having 430 million in the bank is not enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exhaustion can play havoc on a body and brain too. We all get quite loopy when we are extremely out of gas! Sad that the rich and famous never seemed satisfied and keep pushing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Ryan Seacrest have a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)?  I had one of those in Feb. this year and I still take aspirin to prevent stroke.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice vedio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really people? Bien Swatos! He simply looks exhausted!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe just exhaustion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan, I’ve commented on the packed schedule you’ve kept, and it appeared at the time of my initial comment, you were trying your best to stay relevant in the public eye. I was hard pressed to see how you could enjoy a personal life; family gatherings, trips, or just regular Sunday meals with you. You’ve created an undeniable host presence &amp; media empire now, which is commendable. But at what costs are you willing to sustain so much celebrity relevance if your physical well-being begins to suffer, and this time suffer publicly?  Your health has cried out and is willing to take you out of the game. I hope you take the time to reflect on what is most important to you personally. If it includes some sort of public acknowledgement, then you are living for the wrong audience. Enjoy your blessings and really take a step back to eat at the table with those who will really miss you if you depart this life early. I wish you improved health and happiness.🍀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was something. This isn&rsquo;t the first time this has happened. I&rsquo;ve noticed it before in a recent televised appearance. Please get plenty of rest. All the added covid-19 stress and stay at home orders, doesn&rsquo;t help.

<li>
<p>No one is more important than your own personal health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who cares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can see when they come back from the break he was just woken up, he fell asleep in a 2 minute commercial, he’s clearly exhausted as they stated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The robot is malfunctioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He lying about needing rest&hellip;somthing is wrong&hellip;ummm idk maby a malfunction or shapeshifting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bell&rsquo;s Palsy for sure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interesting how the media practically ignored his sexual abuse of Suzie Hardy few years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drunk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stroke? Get well, Ryan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apparently everyone is a qualified healthcare worker that can understand the signs of a medical issue.. (sarcasm)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has worked 3 to 4 jobs forever and it should be easier doing them all from home now.  I&rsquo;m not buying it either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we need to protect ryan at all costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah he’s addicted to adrenachrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DIdn&rsquo;t this happen to 2 Face from Batman before he became 2 Face?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No way. Maybe even popped a bar too early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was turnt that is all lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had, what my Dr. said, was a “mini-stroke” one time, all of a sudden I was slurring words and my legs felt numb, and I couldn’t stand on them.  I had taken too much a medication, to be perfectly honest—I was trying to get off xanax, and I couldn’t stand the anxiety because of a job I DESPISED, in which they were trying to get me to leave, and we’re treating me like dirt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So we’re all in agreement that his reps statement means drugs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reptilian?

<li>
<p>ambien, otherwise fine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he is the true idol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Can we start having a serious conversation about where hate comes from?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This dude NEEDS to take a freakin break like seriously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TAKE A VACATION RYAN YOU DESERVE IT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was thinking the same or it could be he was shocked to see the American idol voting results!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like Bell&rsquo;s Palsy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working from home isn’t the bestes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever it was, own it!  Stroke, heart attack, or hemorrhoids, lead the charge as spokesman for the condition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe he needs to learn how to say NO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bells palsy or a stroke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CGI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to take a rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn’t look like a stroke to me (I worked in the Neuro ICU)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He had a mini stroke.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like he has some inflammation in his eyelids like blepharitis. Maybe he should wear eye glasses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looked like possible TIA.. and he knew something was off on live tv no less, so he used his hands to try and offset. I’ve had them before, seems like one to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seacrest out.

</li>
<li>
<p>Yikes hes looking old- could it be an alcohol problem? If he was at home thered be more access to that stuff. Hope hes okay!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wasn’t worried</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was what is known as a T.I.A. (trans ischemic attack).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seacrest out&hellip;.late coppin drugs last night</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is he ok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was out of it..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like maybe a minor panic attack because I’ve had someone tell me my face looked a little distorted bc I had an episode. Nonetheless, he should rest and relax a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So he’s under so much stress from over work but he is ok and no stroke? Lol ya who’s buying that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his PR people will say its nothing..I cry BS&hellip;did he go to hospital ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan seacoast Stephanie long</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Umm, one word&hellip;.drinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be bell&rsquo;s palsy too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No stroke, his pills just kicked in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan seacoast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what they say&hellip;I am a nurse and I have seen more strokes than I can count&hellip;this looked like  a TIA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan Stephanie&rsquo;s Pratt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>كبر حتى كبر شنو هل سخافه</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was booze. He comes off tipsy. Or maybe pills. Remember when Paula was on something on live television?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% TRUE : Ryan Seacrest smoked a hit of DMT, a powerful and quick acting psychedelic compound during the commercial break. DMT only lasts for a few minutes, but he was still under the effects of the drug for a few moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take care of yourself Ryan. Your health is worth more than  fame or some show!!!

<p>I don’t know why they bring back American idol years ago I’m sticking with the old American idol from my childhood when I was growing up in the early 2000’s when It was on Fox Judges like Jennifer Lopez Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would take my money and retire&hellip;what&rsquo;s the point of making millions if you&rsquo;re dead?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He paid them to lie as there is no way he was ok or healthy! He will learn what he has been told is healthy isn’t like us basic people already know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a mild stroke and it probably led to nothing. My brother had a similar incident happen to him  and he is totally fine. Ryan should get a check up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the mfs in this comment section take being a fan to another level. yall know his mental state, physical state &amp; emotional state but couldn&rsquo;t warn anybody that he was at risk of something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan  seacoast Stephanie&rsquo;s Pratt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the man is tired&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extroverts cant handle social isolation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very Possibly a Migraine. Many people have difficulty with speech and swollen eye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You ALL need to get a LIFE! Some say his right eye is half closed,, some say his left eye is swollen!??? Dude just had to fart or burp when he covered his mouth while speaking.  Saying he had a stroke is signs of ,,,YOU PEOPLE AINT GOT A LIFE!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hollywood you truck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks as if it all comes down to a need for rest. Maybe he was just really tired and exhausted, and that’s why his words were slurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transient ischemic attack / migraine / or both</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illuminati confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he&rsquo;s on drugs helloooooo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yawner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why can’t they get a stand in host?? He’s obviously exhausted&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was littt up on opies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s stressing himself too much, he should rest and he also think about settle down with someone who&rsquo;ll take care of him when he comes home from work. I guess. He&rsquo;s doing radio, television   hosting and so on why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>looks like he was speedballing.

</li>
<li>
<p>yes very obvious with his speech.  Something is not right.  I hope he gets checked out ASAP.  Might be time to slow down a bit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks unhealthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ADRENALCHROME all gone folks!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now they start acting very weird!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Military/POTUS/Qteam have rescued over 50,000 kids held in underground tunnels from NY to Ca. That&rsquo;s what the ships were for &hellip;MERCY/COMFORT to treat all the very sick/deformed children/babies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s just bored of the idiocy of American Idol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% he had few cocktails, probably on an empty stomach, on very little sleep. Im sure he didnt think it would affect him like it did bc this guys entire persona is insanely sculpted. No way it was a stroke, for sure booze or he popped a xanax too early in the night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yea im no doctor but he def had a minor stroke at first i had doubts until i saw how different he looked and sounded seconds earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan did not respond to concerns about his health. Title is misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>drunk?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So he&rsquo;s been stressed and anxious, doc puts him on a xanax prescription&hellip;hes feeling especially stressed and anxious that night&hellip; decides to take 2, gets a little sideways. Next</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thats bc the eye and speech changed dramatically in the same few minutes. Since he denies stroke and says fatigue, still waiting for an answer why he wouldnt look like this through the whole show then. Assimilated to ai?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He got ahold of the wrong STUFF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nah he’s probably just full of drugs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This dude getting money!!! N yeah it can take a toll on the body. If you won&rsquo;t rest yo body&hellip; the body will rest on you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan seacoast   daughter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can also say it’s possible he could have been hit with a sudden onset of a migraine. If he was overworked and stressed as well as long hours reading screens and lights in his face could have caused it. Not to mention lack of sleep. It’s a perfect storm. And migraines that come on can sometimes cause some facial swelling, slurred speech, impaired comprehension(like struggling to read), he could’ve also been having sharp pain to one side of his head and if it affected that eye he could’ve been squinting that eye some to compensate the pain(making it look like just one eye was swelling.. and that’s just to name a few effects on the body. Regardless, I hope he gets some rest and feels better no matter the cause!</p>
