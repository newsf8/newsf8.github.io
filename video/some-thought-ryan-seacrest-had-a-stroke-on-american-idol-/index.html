<li>
<p>Oh my God&hellip;. I hope Ryan is alright</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he‚Äôs an android having a malfunction they will reset him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First of all, i didnt even know American Idol was still on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It definitely looks more like Bell‚Äôs palsy than a stroke.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I had to speak in front of that many people I would have a stroke too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs just his Botox wearing off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is probably having adrenochrome withdrawal üòÇ that or he is related to Nancy Pelosi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be honest I‚Äôm just glad he‚Äôs okay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they&rsquo;re covering this up that would be dumb and irresponsible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plot twist: he just wanted to wink but couldn&rsquo;t</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope he is alright he does look like he is having a stroke!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That left arm going up on the table is to brace himself . Trust me</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>He had a mild stroke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stroke or a big line of coke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like he had a stroke to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs low on Adrenochrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;With the added stress of workin from home&rsquo;.. Lol is that meant to be taken seriously?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like more than ‚Äústress‚Äù, but ok.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan is transforming into Dick Clark in self isolation&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúRyan Seacrest is still a hottie as he works through stroke on live broadcast‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s not having a stroke, that&rsquo;s just the face a person makes after a long night of crack and self wallow. Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúHe did NOT have a stroke but he‚Äôs enjoying a well deserved day off‚Äù&hellip; Well why he take a day off??? üßêSounds fishy to me üê†üê°</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who else just sees inside edition and clicks lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well obviously something wasn‚Äôt right here. But nonetheless I wish him good health</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a lifeguard who‚Äôs been trained to recognize stroke symptoms and has actually treated a patient that was having a stroke he looks almost identical to a patient who was in the early stages of having a stroke, it looked as though his arm was starting to lose its function as well when he sat up. It‚Äôs definitely concerning and not normal&hellip;hope he will be okay..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ON DRUGS,BRO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was sitting there watching, and I told my mom ‚Äú something doesn‚Äôt look right, this is kinda weird‚Äù I thought he was trying to read something behind the camera. And turns out I wasn‚Äôt seeing things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He may not have had a stroke but he does not look well. Something was wrong. I hope he is OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That‚Äôs a mind control glitch TELL THE TRUTH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cover up if I&rsquo;ve ever eeen one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress from putting shows on at home??? You&rsquo;re telling me that&rsquo;s more stress then traveling around the around the country???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just noticed that like he looks the &ldquo;sham wow guy&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if one of my clients did that I&rsquo;d be on with 911.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah&hellip;real stressful ‚Äúworking‚Äù from home putting on live television shows. Give me a break.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bull, when has Ryan Seacrest ever taken a ‚Äúday off‚Äù? Something happen to him and he and his reps just don‚Äôt want to disclose it. I bet he doesn‚Äôt appear on Kelly and Ryan for the rest of the week. It‚Äôs not a sign of weakness to admit that you had a stroke or have some other neurological issues going on. You‚Äôre human and life happens. Either way, he needs to slow down and give up some of his twenty jobs. Life is too short and you can‚Äôt take your millions with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan looks like he&rsquo;s 58 years old. They been dragging him around since I was a kid lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs drunk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To me it looked like one eye was suddenly bigger and staring.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He needs a vacation not just the morning  lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like he had a hemiplegic migraine coming on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone malfunction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It probably was Transient Ischaemic Attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He didn‚Äôt slur his words he stuttered like 3 words. It happens all the time an being on tv an everything going on is causing stress and I think his eye was twitching a stroke looks so different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just drunk and high stuck at home like the rest of us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s running low on adrenochrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I noticed his eyes it was so creepy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He definitely suffered a stroke and didn&rsquo;t even know it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He seemed wasted to me when I watched it. Never saw him like that before. Definitely concerned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought he was just giving the audience ‚ÄúThe people‚Äôs eyebrow&hellip;&hellip;..‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really hope he still gets checked out, it could‚Äôve been a mini stroke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another mk meltdown?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn him off and then back on should be good to go after that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I definitely had a &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; while watching this ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glad he‚Äôs okay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a dozen Budweisers I look out of 1 eye when I talk too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was just holding a fart that unexpectedly showed up&hellip;pffffff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migraines have stroke like symptoms too. Happens to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go with a t.i.a.

<li>
<p>Now everything they say I need to watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell who&rsquo;d love to be working from home right now: nurses!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That could also be anxiety, Somebody having a panic attack on national TV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait a sec. So inside edition uploaded this 10 hours ago and I just got the notification?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that his double or something he looks way different then when he comes out in American idol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;added stess working from home&rdquo; &hellip;.imbecils  ! That was much more than stress, obviously!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probably had to give himself his own botox injection since he&rsquo;s staying at home. Things didn&rsquo;t go well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was lit üî•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs probably been drinking all day and forgot to put his makeup on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hope he&rsquo;s ok!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love and prayers to you Ryan!</p>

<li>
<p>I love how we all become medical professionals (apart from actual medical professionals, in which I say Thank you) and diagnose him just by watching a 1 minute clip&hellip;Then get upset that he&rsquo;s not sharing everything with us, because naturally we  deserve to know everything about everyone.

<p>He was practicing the Rock&rsquo;s eyebrow as he&rsquo;s gonna be him for Halloween</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs Bell Palsy‚Äôs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man he looks old now. Like much older than 45</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homeboy talked during the whole video couldn‚Äôt hear anything. Come on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs ok üôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sure sign of an eye stroke..my mom and I have had them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok the whole side dropped a little. Hope he&rsquo;s ok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the eye that was very odd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:11 üêäüëÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He might have had that version of shingles that you get on your head. It can look like a stroke.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a friend of mine whose eye droops the same way every time she gets high on herb lol. Dude be hooking it up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stress caused one my üëÅ to go out as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8th</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He needs his meds ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs just an illusion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;as all of the drug/drink addicts nod knowingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just trying to keep an eye out for Selener.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like he did have a stroke. And his left arm moves down towards his left side of his chest as if he was going to touch his heart area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw that when it first came on his eye was ok  next thing I know  came back on and his eye looked like he had a lazy eye  glad he‚Äôs ok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well if he did have a stroke I guess he would really be like his mentor. Dick Clark

<p>Damn Ryan did they test the covid-19 vaccine on you my guy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I look when I have a migraine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes! Can you do please Ryan Seacrest Tonight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say what you want or Ryan can say what he wants, but until he sees a doctor and they do a cat scan or MRI I‚Äôd be more convinced he had some type of stroke or mini stroke.  It wasn‚Äôt normal.  Face drooped bad he was doing his best to cover his facial paralysis with his hands.</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>without makeup he looks so different ,its like his age is showing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HE&rsquo;S BURNT OUT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s a form of an eye twitch, brought on by stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when you do too much adrenachrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bull he took the morning off to get checked out I&rsquo;m sure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôve had migraines that do this it‚Äôs awful! Wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sure hope he‚Äôs ok. He‚Äôs so likable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s ok.  He just had a few too many beers before the show.  lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan needs to take it easy on that meth pipe!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dick Clark his master had a stroke also!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why everything always happen with him ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It bothers me how one side of the word ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù has this: ‚Äú and the other side has this: ‚Äò</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s higher than a kite

<p>1:13 That quote &ldquo;Ryan, like everyone, is adjusting to these times&hellip;&rdquo; juxtaposed with his eye literally popping out of his head. Lmao I&rsquo;m sorry but thats hilarious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He could have Mysthenia Gravis honestly it mimmick a stroke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn‚Äôt know it is really THAT grueling and stressful making millions working from home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The man works very hard. I hope he&rsquo;s ok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is what cocaine does to you after you didn&rsquo;t sleep at all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well honestly why does he do like 50 million different shows? I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt need the money lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan was in Rob Zombie&rsquo;s house of 1000 corpses with Dwight from the Office Ryan looks so different</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some dude was under the table draining his fun sack is all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He always wanted to follow in Dick Clark&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü•∫My boy is tired. He needs a week or 2 to relax!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bells play looks similar to a stroke.  I had it twice and recovered 100 percent. It affected my eye and mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe he had bells palsy

<li>
<p>How can you tell the difference, Baxter out!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a stroke. May be a reaction to Botox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the rat race. Already causing health struggles on him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just getting old</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11 th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He probably just got something sticky in his eye!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who wanna join up with me a do this song on zoom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it‚Äôs just stress. Doesn‚Äôt look like a stroke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs probably exhausted! He‚Äôs always busy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope he is truly ok&hellip;prayersüôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s lying and the industry is lying they don&rsquo;t want to admit that he absolutely had a stroke on the air</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm not a doctor but I play one on TV! Lol Ryan‚Äôs symptoms in the video remind me of Bell‚Äôs Palsy (nerve disorder not stroke), which many/most of the afflicted recover fully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:02 Kelly Ripa&rsquo;s hubby is fine AF. Go gurlü§©</p>

<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just funny looking. Glad he&rsquo;s ok though</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I call that the &ldquo;pirate eye&quot;Its when u had way to much to drink and didnt eat so now one eye decides it bedtime while the other keeps the show running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His following in Dick Clark&rsquo;s footsteps</p>

<li>
<p>Did they really have to make this guy host this show from his home?? Just postpone the damn thing, he&rsquo;s obviously being overworked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naw my guy was getting slurped down  by the broad under the desk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan needs to see a doctor.  I swear it&rsquo;s that girlfriend of his. She stresses me out lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malfunctioning puppet.!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He works too hard. Bro, enjoy your success, chill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being the typical liberal, he was just doing an homage to Joe Biden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I work all the time and I do it from home.  I don&rsquo;t slur my speech, nor do I have a drooping eye sometimes.  Something happened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He ate a gummy üêª</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He need eye drops!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The added stress from working from home'????</p>

<p>I hope Ryan is ok. Prayers üôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s 45?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mini stroke from working too hard.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>TIA! ü§î</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone malfunction lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not a stroke looked like Bell&rsquo;s Palsy attack treatable with Prednisone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITs obviously something. I hate when they just straight out lie and always say &ldquo;its from exhaustion or dehydration&rdquo;. But whatever. ITs not really our business anyweays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That guy is well known to work 100 percent of his awake time. Proabably did have a stroke.
