<p>I hope that guitar was over 18</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is bad ass, far out, edgy as hell in 2020. Imagine people seeing this in the late 60s?? People must‚Äôve thought he was from another universe (which he probably was)</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to wrap my around the fact that this legend actually existed and walked the Earth at one point of time&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being on that much lsd and just busting out a solo like that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His playing is so effortless he probably finds walking harder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This slaps harder than a Latina when you tell her ‚Äúyour eyebrows are uneven‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was this man trying to put a spell on me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will never understand how he can seamlessly switch between a rhythm riff and lead riff outta nowhere AND sing at the same time</p>
</li>

<p>smoking some purple haze listening to this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All those famous, dead musicians and authors and actors are not really dead. They‚Äôll be dead when they have touched the last one of us, and that won‚Äôt happen in a long time. The last fan of Jimi Hendrix is not yet born.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay strong and fight coronavirus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He really does look like he doesn‚Äôt want to betray the bossu.</p>

<p>Guess you guys aren&rsquo;t ready for that yet, but your kids are gonna love it.</p>
</li>

<p>I should just take my seven guitars and toss them in the dumpster  ü§•ü§®ü•¥.   Correct me if I am wrong, Jimi has flipped the guitar over, strung as a normal guitar low E on top and played it left handed &hellip;.  I think when a child reaches middle school, this video should replace the obligatory film strip of how bee‚Äôs mate üòÇü§£üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that god just needed a kick ass guitarist in his band so he took jimi .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one can convince me there has ever been or will ever be a better guitarist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that performance,that guitar made him a sandwich and ironed his shirts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right after the song, the guitar asked Jimi for a cigarette

<p>At 0:50 where Hendrix say ‚ÄúExcuse me while I kiss the sky‚Äù, it sounds like he‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúExcuse me while I kiss this guy.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason this guy is alone is because you can&rsquo;t get near him or you will get a deadly virus that makes you melt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun Fact: David Gilmore from Pink Floyd got the guitar strap from this guitar as birthday gift from his wife. He used it on most live shows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think when he came out of the womb he had a guitar strapped to his hands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 50 years ago today that you left us beloved Jimi. We will never forget you. You were the first person of Rock that I could identify with, because well you looked like me, as far as being black, and you made it okay to be eccentric, to dare to dream about loving Rock Music, I&rsquo;m sorry you didn&rsquo;t live long, enough to see just how you influenced all people. Thank you so much Mr. James Marshall Hendrix, a true fucking Rockstar!ü§òüñ§ü§òüñ§ü§òüñ§.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who saw him live back then don&rsquo;t know how lucky they are. They saw a true genius at work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>song is hard asf to play and he‚Äôs just dancing like bruh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More talent and soul in one finger than any modern day shredder could have &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People like Jimi, music like this, Woodstock and and all that love and peace man&hellip;!‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíó‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíó. Lol. That all makes me wish I had been there for those times!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many chicks said &ldquo;scuse me while i kiss this guy?&rdquo; And actually did it back then?üò∏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hendrix was just an alien who visited earth on vacation and had to go back to his home planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man was on lsd while singing and still rocked the stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s a legend! I was very young when I listened to him for the first time (I was nine or ten years old)..he changed my life musically. At that time I listened to various kinds of music but (I know it‚Äôll sound strange) after the discovery of Jimi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve begun to be able to understand all kinds of music! For example: the song &ldquo;Blues in F&rdquo; by Davis Spencer Group is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today is your 50th death anniversary. Miss you Jimi and I&rsquo;ll never forget you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an electric guitar could sing, this is what it would sound like!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we all appreciate how the drums complement jimi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifty years ago on this day we lost this legend. His memory and music will outlive us all! üé∏üé∂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a shadow of a doubt, I believe Prince Roger Nelson got his completed style from Jimi Hendrix one of America&rsquo;s greatest influence of the lead guitar. Now we know that Chuck Berry was before him and perhaps Muddy Waters, etc yet he stood out among other nations the most because he understood that African music was concentrated thus he watered some of the music down just so other nations could understand where origins of African instruments come from: the African and later the African American. I love listening to Jimi Hendrix&ndash;he was way ahead of his time in music. God speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 years ago. THE GUITARIST. RIP Jimi Hendrix.

<p>Back in the 60s Hendrix was like &ldquo;Extra-terrestrial&rdquo;&hellip;.not from this world.  The ultimate freak out on guitar.  But he did not see himself that way.</p>

<p>The podcast  &ldquo;The 27 Club&rdquo; did a series on Jimi which im listening to now, and I HAD to look up an example of him playing live! Dude was ON FIRE! üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jim was simply a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù who couldn‚Äôt help but to play the way he did. The ideas just kept flowing. A true artist in every sense of the word. Sorely missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing and hearing this for the first time is like discovering Plutonium by accident !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just imagine being there, tripping on Everthing, seeing a guy with his guitar upside down and being hit with that music. Damn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this song makes me want to abandon my friends due to my loyalty to my gang</p>

<li>
<p>Existe uma era antes e outra p√≥s Jimmy</p>

<p>This song takes me back to Coventry Road island and when I first heard this song my brother played the the eight track tape and I took it if you wanted back I am on Facebook dean.</p>

<p>GOLD EXPERIENCE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suonava anche senza corde questo perch√© aveva fame volere e potere voleva a tutti i costi essere il numero 1  √®  rester√† per sempre il n1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That moaning feedback to end the song was crazy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That solo at the end was literally the craziest shit I‚Äôve ever seen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two periods of time for guitarists. BJ (Before Jimi) and AJ (After Jimi). He was that influential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if that guitar just grew out of his body and became part of him.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time I found a new line of work.&rdquo;</p>

<li>
<p>JustTwenty years earlier people where dancing to Vera Lynn. Then jimi came along what a monster change. üò®üò®üò®üò®üò®üò®üò®</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s strung his Stratocaster upside down left handed got the idea from Dick Dale and the deltones but guess what you&rsquo;ll never hear surf music again</p>

<p>I was at that festival, too far away to see Jimi, sitting on top of a semi trailor at the back of the crowd. But could hear his amazing music! Will never forget that weekend - Jimi, Allman Bros., Johnny Winter, 400,000 brothers and sisters!</p>

<p>He would have been 78 in November. I&rsquo;d like to think he would still be pushing the envelope even now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was Hendrix thinking with that weird futuristic feedback ending?So ahead of his time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:11 Jimi could speak Guitar language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legends say that the frequencies in this song give you a rare, incurable, killer virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evryone talking about him playing with one hand but can we regard the fact that he is playing a right handed guitar left handed??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the grim reaper came for Jimi the first thing the reaper said was &quot; can I get an autograph? &quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo this is by far like the greatest thing I&rsquo;ve seen&hellip; Ever. This man. Fucking.ripped.that.guitar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just amazed at the talent and years of perfecting an art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timeless classic one of a kind the bruce lee of musician&rsquo;s..RIP jimmy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I regret that I never witnessed Jimi in concert because I am of that generation. He gave us so much in so little time&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw jimi at the Atlanta pop festival 1970 at 4am in the morning his playing was absolutely mesmerizing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And a great influence  on my own</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guitar style&hellip;thankyou jimi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate when people compare Hendrix and god.. Like yeah sure he&rsquo;s cool and everything but he ain&rsquo;t no Hendrix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I that was 15 years old in military school in Bamberg South Carolina when I first heard Jimi Hendrix he changed my life forever the greatest guitarists in the world

<p>Rip Jimmy :'( 50 years gone but not forgotten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i distinctly remember hearing this song for the first time &ndash; it&rsquo;s been well over 50 years &ndash; i carried the tune home over and over in my head waiting to find it on the fretboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Purple haze, all in my eyes&rdquo; attempts to get the purple haze out of his eyes 1:50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These lyrics make a lot more sense when you know what purple haze is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:51 is the best guitar solo ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Greatest. The epitome of Cool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Think Jimi invented the big ending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is what guitars sound like when they reach their climax.</p>
</li>

<p>See That Strap..Belongs To Dave Gilmour Now..Or Should I Say He&rsquo;s Looking After It For Jimi.</p>

<p>at 0:29 Hendrix needs to swing his sleeve out of the way with his right arm so he plays a one-handed riff of high speed pull-offs like it&rsquo;s nothing</p>

<p>GOD TOOK HIM AT 28 UNBELIEVEABLE WHAT HE DID IN HIS SHORT LIFE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in some ways its kinda sucks being 65 yrs old but I was there watching this concert&hellip;started with big fireworks display as it was July 4th. After fireworks he immediately started and first song was star spangled banner..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guitar that Jimi Hendrix is playing in the video is actually his stand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change my mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devil sold his soul to hendrix!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just ended a very enjoyable 1 hour Jimi Jam with this song.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chaz chandler was a genius how he handled this band.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the greatest guitarist ever. Made me smile and feel 50 years younger. Oh to be 18 again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no delay between his brain and his fingers. He just thinks the music. Noone else ever played the guitar like that. Maybe, in the future&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That guitar sound was the signature sound of 1970.  When I hear it I immediately remember &ldquo;1970&rdquo; and the styles of that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes he&rsquo;s good but pretty average for some guitar players that I know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me name 1 BIRELI LAGRENE</p>

<p>This in my opinion is the best version of purple haze by miles

<p>The best artist ever‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£ RIP Jimi  Hendrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t so much &ldquo;ahead of his time&rdquo; as outside of it. Outside of all time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:37 HE LOOKED.. GUYS HE LOOKED!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>playing it very close to the record here! Super Genius Talent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a closeup his fingers seem soo rigid, it&rsquo;s like he has a hard tims moving them, but his playing is so smooth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I first listened to a Jimi Hendrix album inn 1968 !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly too much for me to comprehend that a man like this, who could not read music and was self-taught, can play like that in just 13 years. I think it would take me that long just to learn this one song. No amount of fulsome praise can truly describe how much of a talented genius Jimi was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This song makes me want to summon my stand once and then literally never again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The greatest guitarist of all time.  Hands down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excuse me while I kiss this guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My man, sure do miss good playing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I know who Princes mentor was. RIP my Brothers until I Kiss the Sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And that my friends why my parents name me hendrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>~ Jimi Died 50 years ago today, Sept 18th 1970. Thank you for blessing us with your light. RIP Brother ~ *</li>

<li>
<p>one handed solo , Jimi cud hve play 2 strats at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope you can kiss the sky now&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loved him, and saw him in concert. Greatest ever!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevermind his guitar, somebody go get me this man&rsquo;s wardrobe asap</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>He came to visit and share with us. Then it was time to go home. There was  a small portion of us that where shared to. Don‚Äôt ever take it for granted because he is not coming back.</p>

<p>Even if you know nothing about music, you know this is great</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has those crazy long fingers</p>

<p>Jimi plays with one hand without strumming. He just grabs a guitar and it starts to play by itself.

<p>He plays that guitar as if it&rsquo;s an another extremity of his body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should not be forgotten that this gifted was left-handed and the guitars were made for right-handers, therefore Jimmy Hendrix played them to his left side, and that meant the guitar with the strings around. And well, everything was, is, and will be the best guitarist of all time. Any questions ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank god i read shiori experience and got to listen to a masterpiece like this</p>

<p>We were 20 in &lsquo;70, drove from Little Rock to The Atlanta International Pop Festival in my van. For us it was Friday afternoon, The Allman Bros. started things off. I was humbled by the entire festival being so beautiful.  Number 1 groups following 1 right after another. What I enjoyed of Hendrix was late Sat. night. He had his multi colored cape and clothes blowing me away. This was the biggest festival I saw. If my details are off I&rsquo;m disappointed yet not surprised? Peace lives on</p>

<p>SO WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM? WHERE&rsquo;S ELVIN JONES WHEN WE NEED HIM?!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was there in 1970 and Hendrix played late on the 4th of July and gave one of the great performances of his career. This was the second time I saw him play and there are great musicians still today, so don&rsquo;t get bored or broken spirited. Still those were the greatest times for me and the hippies were wonderful. We could have shared a nation and a world of brothers and sisters in one free rainbow unity, dispensed with money and wars, and gotten on with green solar and wind power for each and everyone &hellip;and we still can do it. Love to you all.</p>

<p>What is Purple Haze ? It&rsquo;s an acid drop to make people fly,  jim Hendrix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excuse me while I kiss the sky</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hendrix sempre bom de ouvi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when music required talent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just had LSD for breakfast, danke Jimi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That lick&hellip; like a wobbly dive he does&hellip;1:32&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Been listening to him all my life, and other guitarists&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never. Seen. That. Before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does anyone of you know, what happened to his guitars, after he died?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE GUITAR IS EXACTLY LIKE MINE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, Jimi is NOT dead&hellip;..he just went back to his home planet &hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guitar is like his body&rsquo;s organ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he&rsquo;s for guitar tortures what mr. Adam Ansle was to Photography; someone who sucks the marrow out of his instruments and show exactly what is ingenuity is all about. It&rsquo;s not the instruments that&rsquo;s going to break the rules, it&rsquo;s the human mind. Use it, live it, Show it. The rest of the World wants it Bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crazy how effortless he is playing that guitar. He was one of a kind. Incredible!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my favorite touch, just plug in the wound up telephone cord and go!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the reason why Rolling Stone named this God, #1 Guitarist of all time!!! He broke barriers and helped shape future guitarists sound, by emulating him.  Gone way way too soon üò•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, If he were only alive today the stories he and his guitar could tell&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six string magic üî•</p>
</li>

<p>JIMI Hendrix is the greatest rock guitarist that ever lived.  No one, I  mean NOONE can be compared to his unique and original music.  He will always remain an iconic and unforgettable, extraordinary musician!

<li>
<p>He needs to take some Guitar lessons and learn how to tune his Guitar correctly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imagine how good a Hendrix unplugged album would have been</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is the greatest guitarist of all time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 years later.  Everyone still compares. Is this a coincidence? No. Jimi was THEE SHIT.. I see that youngsters are capable of playing this, like Nintendo. Try to write it.</p>

<li>
