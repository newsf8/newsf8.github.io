<li>
<p>Obviously she just lost her husband and her daughter. Can y’all leave that woman alone? Tf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can’t imagine how she’s feeling, I just wanna give her a huge hug. All I want is no updates on them. Vanessa and the Bryant family deserve to mourn in peace..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously she’s gonna be broken SHE LOST HER HUSBAND AND BABY LEAVE HER ALONE 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I promise y’all we don’t need updates on this woman’s grieving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s literally like someone has ripped her heart out. Words can’t even describe&hellip;..may god protect her, comfort her in these tragic times😥💔🙏🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh no she’s not just shocked and heartbroken, she’s feeling way deeper than that. Imagine a husband and a child not coming home everyday for the rest of her life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just imagine being in Vanessa Bryant’s situation:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding out her husband and daughter are never coming home..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could never relive my life. But I hope Vanessa will feel better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His fame didn’t go to his head he was always such a humble guy who enjoyed every minute of his successes. Rip Kobe rip Gigi. This sucks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s more then heartbroken. And her 17 year old daughter was rushed to the hospital after the news. And I can&rsquo;t wait to hear Vanessa stay strong Vanessa #MambaForever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This woman lost not only her husband BUT HER CHILD!!! As a mother, loosing a child is your worst fear and she lost BOTH on the same day!!!!! Not to mention, Kobe and Gigi share the same birthday so just imagine when August comes around&hellip;my heart is BROKEN for not her and her girls, but for all the families and friends that lost the people they love on that chopper💔💔💔💔 I wish it could have panned out differently and the pilot would have said no😢😢😢😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Nobody is missing Kobe AND GIANNA more than Vanessa.”</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>There I fixed it for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This woman lost her husband but also her daughter.  Back off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worst pain any parent can feel is having to bury their own precious child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “source “ who put her business out is trash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7month old dang that’s crazy her father is Kobe and she will never have any memories of her father😭🙏

<li>
<p>don&rsquo;t do Vanessa like y&rsquo;all did Lauren London, leave that woman tf alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leave Vanessa alone and let her grieve in private.  It&rsquo;s innapropriate to display her grieving the loss of her husband and daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate when people say “don’t say RIP Kobe and post about him when you don’t even know him” like that bothers me because I feel bad and it gets me sad what their family, friends and fans are going through right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Time of God comes,  he will be resurrected,  he is just temporarily gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all are forgetting that Gigi had sisters&hellip; can you imagine how they feel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone  is saying she lost her husband.  Are they forgetting she also  lost her little girl?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man was an absolute legend he was amazing.\</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P Kobe and Gianna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She lost two important family members. Bless her and her remaining daughters’ hearts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever is the “ source close to the family “ needs to never be allowed in her house again. Let her grieve in PEACE. Without media around her/ anyone giving press info about how she feels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way she look at her husband in that interview.. like a proud wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he seems so sweet, i am devastated.. his youngest daughter didn’t even got a chance to properly get to know her father or her sister💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember there is a husband suffering deeply with 3 children under his care as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so bad for you Vanessa, your husband will always de remember 😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This just really shows that no matter how much money you got or high high your social status is, everyone faces life. The Bryant family in our eyes were untouchable but they are human too. So unexpected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP to ALL 9 who died 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God, please bless Vanessa Bryant with peace, let her realize she was loved by her husband, understand that he and their baby are together in heaven and to live in love the rest of her days with her 3 remaining blessings on earth.  🙏🏽 until they meet again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t need updates on the family’s grieving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let them mourn in peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capri: Mom what ever happened to daddy?

</li>
<li>
<p>This poor woman. I cant imagine how she&rsquo;s feeling.  My heart breaks for her. I hope she can some day be able to .. smile with great memories of her loved ones</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Just hasn’t hit her quiet yet once everything calms down it’s gonna be horrible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Shocked” and “heartbroken” doesn’t even begin to touch how she’s feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched Kobe play throughout my entire childhood, and I miss him and Giana so much. Giana was going to be in the WNBA too 😔</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>When I heard the news she was the one Who I thought of first just can’t imagine</p>

<li>
<p>&ldquo;No one is missing kobe more than Vanessa&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course that&rsquo;s his wife</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should talk about Gigi more she was a legend too. Rest In Peace Kobe and Gianna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last week everything was normal and she had no idea that next week her life would completely change for her 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you imagine you trying to process&hellip;. I lost my husband, childhood sweetheart, father of my children n best friend n in the very next breathe you realize &hellip;. and my 13 year old daughter is gone too💕🏀😪💔 My heart aches for Vanessa. I don’t usually cry for deaths of people I don’t know personally. However I keep crying for her&hellip; God please send your angels to wrap themselves around her right now n give her the strength to carry on 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💕💕💕</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such an intelligent man, I hope God blesses those that are grieving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is one of the saddest stories I have ever heard 😔 so many lives lost&hellip;&hellip; so many families torn. It really hurts my heart 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She never once took her eyes off of him , she truly loved that man .</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>this is so sad 😔 she doesn&rsquo;t deserve this, not only did her husband die but her daughter did too 😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved Kobe and always will. I feel so heartbroken for his entire family. RIP Kobe Bryant we’ll miss you 1-26-20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine your own child passing before you, I can’t imagine what she’s going through and too lose her husband aswell. Rip Kobe and gianna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, WE are shocked and heartbroken&hellip; What Vanessa must be feeling however is so much more and we can’t put it into words :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:36 that is in Philippines 😢 they made mural painting in a basket ball court to give honor to our legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine how Vanessa must be feeling, I hope someone is looking out for her health as she goes through these emotions. ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t even know him personally but I do know I’ve grown up watching him play basketball and I was hurt and shocked when I heard Kobe was gone. RIH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave that woman alone dang she just lost her husband and daughter rip Kobe my fav basket ball player and my inspiration and gianna to my bday is February 9 🤧😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a tragic end and loss to his wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May Kobe and his daughter along with other passengers rest in heavenly abode .Sincere condolences to Kobe' a wife and their daughters😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;m crying you can tell how much she loves him just by the way she looks at him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dear God let her feel the world embracing her. I can’t imagine losing the only thing I’ve ever known AND THE ONE I PROTECT  the most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine how to feel if i lost loved  ones so close to me like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is so heartbreaking! I can’t even imagine the pain her and her children are in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quote of the day: “Death ends a life, not a relationship.” –  this means that Kobe is not fully gone we still have memories about him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never has a death made me question my existence. Made me question what I’m doing with my life. Living your passion working hard at what I love. I have to change my life. Live everyday like it’s my last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i don’t think “shocked” or “heartbroken” even begins to scratch the surface of how she’s feeling. god let the woman grieve in peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t even like basketball but my eyes are in tears for this legend R.I.P❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I was her I would feel so sick to my stomach knowing that I’m going to have to wake up everyday never seeing my husband smile at me or hearing my daughter tell me that she loves me.😭😔💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dam when Kobe said that’s part of the deal I got chills

<li>
<p>What about his Mother, I’m sure she’s overwhelmed with grief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She lost a husband and her daughter. Now she has to take care of her 3 daughter by herself 😫 they just had a baby 7 months ago she didn’t even turn one yet omg 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People must not care about how his 17 years old daughter must feel.😣😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly feels unreal! Even though death is a part of being a human being just feels unreal especially in the tragic way it happened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where are his parents? His sisters? I&rsquo;m sure they are hurting too. 😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re were perfect for each other. My  heart bleed. Rest well Kobe and Gigi😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hopefully he was able to hold his daughter on the way to haven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She had the same look Lauren was giving Nipsey on that extra interview 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just imagine what he was saying to his daughter and how helpless he felt knowing he couldn’t protect his babygirl. that’s what breaks my heart. he really died two times. once knowing he couldn’t do anything to help gigi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I once said &ldquo;Kobe&rdquo; when I shot paper into the trash, now I say, &ldquo;For Kobe&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man why does this feel like a dream!!! Kobe comeback, ur not supposed to die yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s not forget Kobe’s mom, dad, and sisters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so sorry for your loss Vanessa. I can’t imagine the pain your going through. My thoughts and prayers go out to your family.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>RIP Kobe and Gianna</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She never expected to live her life without him. other than the time she wanted to divorce him. Rip kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope God gives her lots of strength 😞 i could never imagine being in her position</p>

<p>Who else was expecting the news to come on and say that it was a misunderstanding and that they not dead i was waiting for that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave her alone with her daughters to rest n breath,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe Bryant&rsquo;s death is the most shocking I had ever heard it&rsquo;s bigger that Michael Jackson Whitney Houston and Prince I am so heartbroken my heart thoughts and prayers go out to the family R.I.P DADDY KOBO AND HIS LIL PRINCESS GIGI⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking into her eyes looking at him it seems like she not only was deeply in love with him but she also looked up to him like we do!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Shocked” and “Heartbroken” seem like major understatements. God bless her for staying strong for her daughters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have never felt so bad for someone in my life, I’m so sorry for this Vanessa, Kobe and Gigi didn’t deserve this. May your souls find peace one day. Rest easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People more like kobe and daughter lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody actually caring about the wife, a mother who left alone in a family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s sad how they call the other people that passed others like can they have a bit of respect and at least say they name but rip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever “Friend” that leaked that info should be ashamed of themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P Kobe And Gianna And The 7 Others that lost their life’s in That Helicopter 🥺😔🙏🏼🙏🏼 ❤️</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>He’s the reason I started playing basketball and every time I shoot im say Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shocking accident happened in my family many years ago,  with the death of my basketball loving brother,  19 years old, a college kid, he had no chance to even protect himself a drunk driver.   No insurance, hit and run, to this day, 50 years later,  i wonder if the young driver is still alive.  My outraged parents never recovered, and neither did I.   Tell your kids you love them every day, do not fail to do this&hellip;instantly, that fast, they can be gone.  😥😥😥&hellip;.Wishing peace for the Bryant family. 😞😞&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really thought 2020 was going to be a good year and we’re definitely wrong. Just look at what’s happening already. Who knows what will actually happen in 2079.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is so sad,💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😭. R.I.P to everyone and my deepest condolences to the families..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s been with him since she was 17 😭😢 she lost her Husband, her Best Friend, the father of her daughters, her baby girl who was only 13 I hope she’s surrounded by loved ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we were extremely blessed to have been able to witness his greatness on &amp; off the court; THANK YOU, MERCI, HVALA, GRAZIE, OBRIGADO our dear sweet Kobe 🏀✨ RIP to all who lost their lives ❤💙🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a year , and she still doesn’t see him , it’ll hit even harder. In two years , even harder. Grief is a strange thing to predict. I do know it’s hard from the start. Prayers to both of the families 🙏.

<li>
<p>The way she looked at him 1:49 when he would talk is admirable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4th day and I&rsquo;m still tearing up remembering all of kobe carrer. He was such an amazing human to everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, why do the best people die early?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in a garden, which flower do you pluck first?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sure all of us are crying over this tragedy. My heart aches watching these tribute videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really wish this could be announced as a mistake, joke or a movie scene&hellip; This is heartbreaking!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine not being able to mourn with your 13 year old over her father’s death because she shared his fate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never take my darling Husband for granted, nor my precious children.  Life is a gift so take it 1 day at a time and thank God Almighty for everything🙏🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know exactly how she feels my husband of 11 years passed away two years ago I thought I would lose myself but instead I started a YouTube channel to speak out about my experience my condolences go to everybody that passed away that day and their families I really feel for kobes wife tho because I know what it&rsquo;s like to be a widow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine losing your husband and daughter and feeling ecstatic</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Ofc she’s going to feel numb. God I hate the media and press. Leave her be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few more other things that I would like to point out when Kobe was alive Kobe Bryant got a lot of ridicule about things and I can remember just like it was yesterday how the world turned on Kobe when they found out a white woman was saying that Kobe raped her all type of people in the NBA returning a back on them until he got found not guilty but that&rsquo;s in the past but I want to thank Kobe because he did a lot of things behind the scenes for black Americans and I never knew who Kobe Bryant was I wasn&rsquo;t a follower he has but I knew that he played basketball but I respected the brother most of all because he took care of home where a lot of Americans say that black African American men don&rsquo;t take care of their homes and Kobe was one of those he had a few more kids with his beautiful wife and I want to thank you as being his wife for standing by him when things were rough people criticized him and people loved him my hat goes off to you being a real wife in a real woman and thank you for standing by Kobe because a lot of women turn they back on African American men and that&rsquo;s why most of us buy out here living the way we live because we don&rsquo;t have a strong Queen in our life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you lose a love one/s, food is the last thing on your mind. You have rapped weight loss &amp; you listen to voice notes and watch videos a million times. You never get over it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just can&rsquo;t imagine what&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s going through. To lose a child and your life&rsquo;s partner is paralyzing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God Bless to the family and friends.</p>
</li>

<p>In this world pain and comfort visit every person time to time with a purpose but their meaning is not understood by every person. it is believer only who, in either situation mentions Allah (God) and attribute the good or the bad days to Him with thanks and patience. Here is a tearful video of one of the famous speakers of Islam from Australia,  who lost his son and brother in an accident few days back. What are his thoughts and how he reacts to the situation is worth watching. The wife of Kobe is indeed going through a severe pain, but all the goodness lies in the Hands of Allah. The more we are conscious of Him, greater will be the shower of goodness and mercy upon us. And more we are unconscious of His remembrance, severe will be the days&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the services, she needs to take her family and go away to give herself and her girls space to process. Now it&rsquo;s just shocking. Bless their hearts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAMMMM SO SAD STILL CANT BELIEVE THIS🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The source” who the hell knows how accurate that is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They werent just married they were bestfriends. People seem to forget that&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How they think she feel. This video is rude and inconsiderate messed up and disrespectful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is so sad 😞 I’m going to watch some porno to take my mind off this to sentimental</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like she’s never going to have time to fully heal anytime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soon  because everyone is going to keep talking about Kobe and Gigi for a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m married 14 yrs and my life is nothing without my wife so just imagine what she going through</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is there even a &ldquo;source&rdquo; come on man let her grieve ffs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi edagdwg she has a lot of love to hold on to hearing him even when he&rsquo;s not there in person his soul will always be with her true love never dies stay prayed up God is always around a mom Linda j peace ❤️💯🌈🌈</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s has to be more than this life, this life can’t be the end, 🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Don’t cry because it’s over. Smile because it happened”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We miss u Kobe</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>“And 7 others”? Ok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all dying anyway we just don&rsquo;t know when or how&hellip;. Meet you all in the afterlife.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>seeing Shaq cry, broke my heart.

<p>Sad thing is she wont be even able to see them when arranged for the last time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world lost 9 angels but Haven gained 9 amazing angels 💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa and Family ,the City of Brotherly Love have all of you in their thoughts and prayers here Philadelphia, Pa. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My gosh&hellip;.it feels like he&rsquo;s still alive. There&rsquo;s just no way to understand what Vanessa is going through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kinda wish they had a son so we could see kobe in him :( RIP bryants, chesters, altobellis, mauser♥♥♥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if she dreams about their death being a dream and then waking up</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>She probably can’t even sleep thinking about this.. Rest in peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “source” who aired her business should be locked out of the house. What trash! Like you don’t think we can’t fill in the blanks on this one ourselves smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gianna has her daddy&rsquo;s eyes #RIPKobeAndGianna 🙏🙏🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP to the 7 others who passed as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has been with him since she was 17 she doesn’t no anything else 🙏🏽🙏🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has the NTSB even looked into whether the pilot had a medical emergency or heart attack. Sometimes it’s not something so complicated but something so easy it’s overlooked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way she looked at him..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may take years to recover from one death. But having to deal with two.We can only pray for her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the thing that really matters is losing a child i dont even wana get close to imagining that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what’s sad is that death has no age, we just need to remember to say “I love you” to the people you love every single day, even if it’s random. Cause you never know what time will be your last time you say “I love you”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We love Kobe!

</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s the way she’s suppose to feel, barely making it. While trying to hold it together in front the kids. But if u need to breakdown in front of them, do so. She needs to fall completely apart, her family &amp; friends will take care of household, kids &amp; anything else. Let that Woman &amp; her kids mourn. She’s going through the most horrible never imaginable tragedy ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is so heartbreaking prayers to them all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even believe it still. My pain is for the wife 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave Vanessa alone. She lost her husband and DAUGHTER!! she needs time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the shock begans to fade the reality is very stark and cold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God bless every family member and friend that had a loved one to die that tragic day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May his peace wrap them in his loving arms for comfort and peace. 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so horrible for her. I can’t imagine losing a child. That just rips the heart out of a mother &amp;/or father’s heart forever. I hope she finds peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bless her soul I can&rsquo;t imagine how she&rsquo;s feeling daughter and husband they loved each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so heartbroken can’t imagine how Vanessa is feeling and his girls. God be with you in this sad sad moment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all leave her alone she needs her time to greave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excitement. Dreams. Memories. Thank you Kobe for everything that you were! You will always be in the hearts of every basketball loving Filipinos&hellip; 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:49 look at the way shes looking at him 😭😭😭❤❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one can relate to what she is feeling right now. So sad. Both died too young.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Mandela Effect is real, please apply it to this amazing human been. Condolences from Italy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these people complaining about “what about the other people on board” They are angry that Kobe and his daughter getting all the attention. These same people wouldn’t care if someone in their town, city or state died. I’m sure someone died today in their neighborhood and they didn’t care. Why didn’t they care tho? Because, they probably didn’t know them or have any connection to them.  RIP to all victims but you cannot force mourning upon people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would he die leaving behind 2 children, And a pregnant wife!? 😭 &hellip; Leave here alone Let her be &hellip; She needs time 😫

<p>What do you say to Young Widow who lost her soulmate and child at the same time. You are stronger than you know you are. But you are not alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is fragile. This is why we need to slow down, look at our loved ones, and say what we need to say&hellip;..say it now. Do not wait. Even if it is painful, even if it is uncomfortable, say it now. Remind them how thankful you are. Before they leave, look at them, and tell them, I love you. Don&rsquo;t keep things inside because of ego, or pride. Be true to them, and to your feelings. I lost the father of my daughter, an Army Veteran, greatest man I have even met. Never hurt a soul. I talk to him all the time, even in death, and I thank him for our daughter. They stay with us in spirit, and they remind us of that. Sometimes is a favorite song, or a memory, or a beautiful bird singing by your window. They remind us that life is still beautiful, to smile, and live life to the fullest.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>But kobe the legend I&rsquo;d dead😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you are 10 years old and you tell your friends you gonna win an NBA championship, you know that&rsquo;s in the realm of a possibility&hellip; but winning an Oscar? Bahhhh&hellip;.&rdquo; WTF did I just listen to? lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Philippines loves KOBE so much. We are all mourning his passing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After loosing my father in 2008,brother in 2011, my mother in 2012, sister in 2017 and 2 cousins and aunt in 2019 ( all a few months apart) I know exactly how she feels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t imagine how Vanessa is feeling rn, loosing the love of your life and a daughter that you both created. God please give this women strength and please look after her and her daughters. 🦋</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🌹💐🏵️Kobe and his daughter are in Heaven. 🌹💐🌼🏵️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praying for her and her family I know how it feels to lose a child, I lost my 10 year old daughter on the same day of 2018 so I know that pain but to lose a spouse and child oh man I can’t imagine. I just pray that God strengthens her and her children, family and friends it never gets easier you just learn to deal with it. Prayers up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>man you dont know  how it feels to lose a daughter and a husband man</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>that feeling of living happy as a family together ain&rsquo;t no more she cant see or hear the smile and laugh of her daughter and not even the warm hugs and smile of her husband they ain&rsquo;t no more it&rsquo;s gone forever and everything is numb for her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same feels. I lost my dad 6 months ago and I know what Vanessa and her children feels coz I have also seen my mom grieve. It&rsquo;s honestly devastating and during that time I also felt numb which I literally said in real life. Nothing seems to be real, youre in so much pain you couldnt feel anything at all. You would cry from time to time and not want to talk to people. I pray she and her family seeks the Lord in this very hard time. I totally understand what it feels to lose a loved one. Continue to pray and ask God for a dream to show you they&rsquo;re all ok. I dreamt of mine the day I told God I was in so much pain and I want closure with my dad bc I never got to say goodbye. His death was also sudden, i saw him alive in the morning and he died in the afternoon when he was away. He hugged me in a dream, he was also teary eyed and everything is full of light. The dream felt so peaceful. God is real. I pray they all draw close to God, who also comforted me in that trial. I&rsquo;m in a better state now since its been 6 months and he still shows up in my dream from time to time to let us know he&rsquo;s just around still watching over us. God bless, Bryant family. ❤️</p>
