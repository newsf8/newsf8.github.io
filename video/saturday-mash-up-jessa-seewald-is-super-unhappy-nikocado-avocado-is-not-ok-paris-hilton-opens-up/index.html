<li>
<p>Yeah I feel bad for Jessa. Out of the older siblings, she&rsquo;s definitely the perfectionist and the most serious. She definitely doesn&rsquo;t show emotion as all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was raised in a traditional Catholic family, and when I was 13 I almost became a nun because I had undiagnosed OCD and Depression and felt that only Jesus could make it better. I was so afraid I would be condemned for the thoughts in my head and had no knowledge that it was actually a mental health condition.  I‚Äôm still a Christian and do think that ultimately Jesus is the answer, but He also gave us tools to care for ourselves. What I never understood was why can‚Äôt medicine and doctors be viewed by Christians as a blessing from God. Christians believe we are given a calling by God, so if someones calling is to heal as a doctor, logically it would be because of God no?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She talked about how she USED to feel as if she hadn‚Äôt truly accepted Christ in her heart&hellip; she talked about how she was doing good in her faith but went through a ‚Äúdry season‚Äù in her faith where she hadnt been seeking God as much as she should have&hellip; then she found the book that talked about spiritual depression and she related to it because she felt as if she was letting God down by not always setting time apart to read his word! Jessa is not depressedü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and no she doesn‚Äôt feel like her parents have made her depressed LOL she simply talked about her testimony and how she realized she had to stop being so hard on herself about all of that! A relationship with Christ is much more than JUST reading a bible. I do agree with alot of what you say, but this was way off from what Jessa talked about.. Christians can go through dry seasons just like anyone else can go through dry seasons of life!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re right, Jessa doesn&rsquo;t know who she is, and she&rsquo;s struggling because at the end of the day, besides being a good Christian and have babies what else is she supposed to do with her life? It&rsquo;s hard when you see other people living their life and you just have to watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is probably suffering from PTSD from the ‚Äúlovingly corporal punishment‚Äù from JB and Shelly in addition the inappropriate behavior from her oldest bro. If she could just get the therapy she desperately needs&hellip;#freejessa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, it was more about protecting Josh to save face and, to make there selves look good for the cameras and to save there selves for the sake of there show. Rather than to take and, get these girls help. As if, they think there religion will take care of that healing and help them move on with there lives. The thing is, I am not condemning religion but, the thing is, sometimes you need more than what your religion can give and, that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. Yes, I agree, God put doctors outhere to help you as well as modern medicine. And, there is nothing wrong with needing that added help. She and her parents need to wake-up to the reality of this world. God didn&rsquo;t make us to be perfect, we are human and, sometimes you need some outside help and take care of yourself, don&rsquo;t be afraid to seek help if you need to. People in your church or family shouldn&rsquo;t think any less of you and, if they do, shame on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sounds like that Jessa suffered from depression from the many incidents with Josh. JB and Michelle didn&rsquo;t get the help that Jessa and Jinger needed (and still need today). Jessa also has three kids under the age of 5 I think she maybe suffering from postpartum depression. I can&rsquo;t believe that a doctor hasn&rsquo;t asked &ldquo;are you having any feelings of doubt after the birth of a child&rdquo;?  In this case I feel really sad for Jessa because if she was allowed to seek professional help and get treated for depression she might be able to become a better person. So sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of them have to be socially awkward. They were only socialized around each other. They never had a chance to see different perspectives on things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg&hellip; PLEASE do not give Nikacado the time of day. That&rsquo;s exactly what he wants. Let&rsquo;s not bring attention to him or his channel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have to remember, these kids are married off and create their own families before their brains are done fully developing&hellip;  it will take a while to unravel if/when they wake up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think she‚Äôs depressed because her and her husband didn‚Äôt get to be married, have fun, travel, grow, have chemistry, etc. They went into a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù lifestyle immediately. Living the same way your parents do is suffocating for young people. Anyone that goes from being a kid to taking care of a kid and has NO adult life in between will collapse inside at one point. This is your life. You didn‚Äôt ask to be here, the least you can do for yourself is take time to live your life before you again are living it for someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She needs to see the same counselor that Jill is seeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for stating that depression is a chemical Imbalance, not something that you can wish or pray away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nick should be demonetized. I do think it‚Äôs fake but I wish people would not watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes me wonder if all of this is from not really getting help for what Josh did to her and her sisters. Growing up my parents were from 2 different faiths. My dad is a devoted Catholic and my mom was Pentecostal, I never had an inclination to follow the Catholic faith. Going to church with mom was so vivid and every time I left the service I wanted to come back ASAP. So my faith is Pentecostal. Having gone to church in my country was everything, it was strict, no pants, no drinking, smoking, or going to dances, and to me it was normal.  When I came to the USA we went to a new church, and it was like 100% different from the other church. My cousin is.a Pentecostal Pastor, and he has a lot of strict rules too, but I am sure it‚Äôs not as strict as the Duggar‚Äôs. Totally agree, if we need the help and you need the meds take them, it‚Äôs not God in going to condemn you. Yes prayer works but u also need medical care. Please get help!! God will always be by your side guiding you and protecting you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crazy part is that Jim Bob would lock the girls room at night so Josh couldn‚Äôt come in &amp; molest them. Insanity!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really would want to see joy make a video, considering she struggled the most with accepting Christianity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s &ldquo;super unhappy&rdquo;? Wasn&rsquo;t the whole point that she USED to be?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jess needs to get professional help for her Depression.   It‚Äôs a chemical imbalance.   The anti depressants help you get to a point of feeling  normal.   Unfortunately her mom and dad  did her wrong by teaching her only their crazy  cult beliefs.   She never got help after being abused by her brother.   I truly hope she gets the help she needs to be a better person.  Remember no one is perfect Jessa

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jessa is not even thirty but has achieved all the life dreams she‚Äôs ever been taught to believe in: to get married and have babies. The aftermath of realizing you have nothing left to aspire to would make anyone depressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who watches Nick avocado??? I agree with you that‚Äôs disturbing but also the people who consume his content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has never had support to deal with the abuse she suffered &amp; she could possibly have some post partum depression.  This is a very sad story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are raised to push down &ldquo;negative&rdquo; feelings and plaster a smile on your face and deny those feelings, you will be depressed!    On top of that, you feel guilty because you have those feelings.  I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s prayed for help and blamed herself for the unanswered prayers.  This is so tragic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you remember when Jessa and Ben were first married, and she didnt want to be fat. I remember  Ben saying he didnt know what to do because he had constantly told her she wasnt fat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People really watch this Nick and Orlin bs?? That is crazy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding Jessa&rsquo;s statement, I would like to argue that her statement is also a typical fundamental Christian statement. Jim Bob in one of the books, Joseph and Kendra Duggar (<a href="https://www.joeandkendra.com/our-story/">https://www.joeandkendra.com/our-story/</a>) in their personal statement on his website, Erin (Bates) Paine in this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ_eymyD8Q4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ_eymyD8Q4</a>) all have a similar pattern. They became aware of their &lsquo;sinfull nature&rsquo; at a young age and got saved At a later age, ususally in their teens or early 20s, they started to doubt their initial &lsquo;salvation&rsquo; and did some sort of a second round. The idea that &lsquo;without true repentence&rsquo;, you can not be truely happy, seems to be recurring. I therefore wonder if Jessa&rsquo;s story is about real feelings of depression/anxiety (in that sense: if it would have been a clinical depression or PPD) or if she copied the storyline of the Christian fundamentalism and added her own story (including, feeling low and overwhelmed after a difficult year and having to deal with a first born baby), finding Christ and therefore finding happiness again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God gave us brains to use ie doctors, medicine , surgery he gave us the Will to use conmmom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I live close to Provo Canyon School. The place is a hellhole. It has a terrible reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, yes love dumping the junk. I had a junk binge last week. I&rsquo;m no fan of clutter. Re: content. Jessa almost seems emotionless. She is a bit of an automaton. She seems very robotic a lot of the time esp her speech patterns. She seems a bit more relaxed speaking to her kids but she is very tightly wound it seems - anyone else think the same?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They followed medical cares for Josie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im a Christian and i believe god put doctors here to help you and i have been through depression and went to a doctor and talked to god for help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jessa was talking about spiritual depression not clinical depression she explains this in her video, even that she wasn‚Äôt sure depression was the right word. She explained it well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing a deep clean always feels freeing afterwards it‚Äôs just getting the get up and go to do it :) I am a super clean person and my Hubble is a bit of a hoarder LOL :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I try not to talk negative but I really can&rsquo;t stand &ldquo;today&rsquo;s&rdquo; Nikocado.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jessa is totally talking about the fundy way of raising kids. You‚Äôre told you‚Äôre an evil, rotten, horrible sinner and your lucky God is even willing to waste his time with you. You‚Äôll never be good enough she probably wouldn‚Äôt have these issues at all if she hadn‚Äôt been raised in that fundy faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sadly the Dugger kids are so sheltered they just don&rsquo;t get things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is mixing up being sad because she is struggling with an actual mental illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean she might have it but in that family are they even allowed to get therapy and meds ?

<li>
<p>How do you as a child be able to conceptualize that you live in sin? She was just parroting what her parents said</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This breaks my heart. I can‚Äôt imagine how her childhood was when the cameras were off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you talk about the Netflix movie &ldquo;Cuties&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was never a huge Paris Hilton fan, in fact, I&rsquo;m a little too young to remember a whole lot about her. My first time seeing her was when she played Amber Sweet in Repo! The Genetic Opera. I always wondered why she would play a role like that or be in a movie like that. It seems totally out of her realm. But now knowing what I do about her it makes a lot more sense. It feels a bit strange to be proud of a stranger for reclaiming their power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched most of Jessa&rsquo;s vid. To me, I did not find substance that reaches deep to heal sounds, just surface Band-Aids. I find this a lot in the faith community. I have friends who suggest books to help and it&rsquo;s just more things that scratch the surface. Maybe for people who go through ordinary troubles it&rsquo;s enough, but for others who have had a multitude of crises it&rsquo;s just not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel bad for Jesse one bit. You see your sister Jill got away but you stay and are still having babies. You can go!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also you need to repent and  be baptized to be saved, not by &ldquo;praying the prayer&rdquo;. Acts 2:38</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your day sounds exactly like mine!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love you Katie. Your life is mine. Mega busy.  Love it. As for depression ect. Go and get help. God gave us doctors that can help us. So get help like medication or therapy and prayer. If that is what you want &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.         prayer alone. Medications alone and therapy alone doesn‚Äôt always work.  Find what helps and works for you.    I was brought up in a family where you never saw a therapist just pray and it didn‚Äôt help me. Finally when I was ready to do myself in (I was ready to drive off a bridge that I was finished with myself and ready to die). Instead I went to see a doctor and told him exactly what I wrote here. and he gave me a medication and set me up with a therapist. For depression,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ope, girl you‚Äôre from the Midwest! It‚Äôs You Guys not ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äô üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jessa really needs to see a psychologist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you please put in time stamps for the various topics because that would be amazing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well guess I&rsquo;m way early on this video because no comments yet. But yes just moved to Colorado Springs and getting rid of a lot of stuff. Thanks for updates. And gotta say I was subscribed for a long time from beginning until I was UNSUBSCRIBED one day. Idk why because I didnt. But anyways I still catch your videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never got the impression that JimBob or Michelle blamed the girls for Josh‚Äôs behavior.  Why are you saying that?  You have said this before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I liked nick. Never missed a single video for years. When this all started&hellip;.the fake stuff&hellip;.i had to unsubscribe from him. Its just sick. Fake or not&hellip;.its disturbing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What am I even watching with these eating YouTubers&hellip;this is the creepiest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. A ton of unhealthy food, does not give you a healthy mind&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched Jessa&rsquo;s video and I got none of those impressions. She was talking about struggling with understanding her faith more clearly. I noticed how you shot through her video without context. She was talking about how she was a bratty child, then when she truly accepted she actually started seeing how that was not good. And her comment about after she had her son is not proof of PPD, it was called being a new mom with a different schedule. She was referring to the fact that as a new mom she didn&rsquo;t always have the time to get to her Bible and the pod cast helped her see that was okay. Some religious folks may under diagnose mental conditions, but the secular world tends to over diagnose them too. You don&rsquo;t have to run to a therapist every time you feel a little blue.</p>

<li>
<p>No, my sister and I (we are 18 months apart in age) fought like cats/dogs. We still fight occasionally and we are adults. Of course, my sister has done some unethical things and while that&rsquo;s her business, she does worry me. She&rsquo;s a lot like the Duggars with her kids. Her kids are adults and they still run to &ldquo;mommy&rdquo; for advice, etc. (Although her oldest son remarried and I think it&rsquo;s funny her new DIL isn&rsquo;t a fan of her!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you Twitch at all? I use it more than YT, and it is awesome. We even have &lsquo;girls nights&rsquo; gaming and chatting, it helps keep me sane! If you use it let me know I will add you!</p>

<p>I had to skip over the middle segment I cannot give those guys any attention.

<p>The expectations were and are so high which sometimes can be good but the Duggars have created a really unhealthy environment. I&rsquo;ve said it before that I think it&rsquo;s nuts the image that is put out, it&rsquo;s not real and never is, the cracks are showing with this family and your right it is sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You would mock amber all the time and added so much hate, wow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loved the first part and the last part&hellip; but the middle why? I didn‚Äôt know who Nick was and now that I do I wish I didn‚Äôt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She needs to watch Zeitgeist people should stop letting religion control your life. Let it make you feel like your a bad person. Heaven and hell are not real , religion Has already caused Great War and turmoil in this world . Give me a like if you have seen it, and get it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You ask what child. Well that would be me. And I am sure many other children raised in cults. My family and the cult I was raised in was so against medication and antidepressants too and they would rather leave me at 13 untreated after a year of doing nothing but planning my suicide they still refused me professional help until the government stepped in. Can you imagine you would rather risk your child killing themselves over getting them help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i think these religions have less to do with baby factories and more to do with pedophilia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dead on with Jessa!  She needs help and has needed help but can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t disobey her parents and church.  What she has gone through is not only a fix with the Bible but a fix with therapy and medication if needed.  I feel for her so much.  It is just sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you are spot on with Jessa. At 17 her brain was at a point of development in which she‚Äôs individuating from her parents and growing out of what worked for her as a child (childlike faith). Neither of those things are affirmed in their family/culture so of course she was going to feel like something was wrong with her. She was going through something very normal but she was not raised to accommodate herself üòî so, so sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering i imagine the bafoon jimmy and wife michelle probably told her to pray for any and all emotions she had for answers and guidance..jessa i imagine wasnt given proper protection from her parents from the seriousness of what happened with josh so turning to god left her feeling confused and questioning. I imagine the parents use god as the family therapist and the bible is their dsm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yep! I love getting rid of stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your back drop is so trailer park!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Narcissistic abuse, ( as I grew up in a narcissistic abusive family) when you&rsquo;re under their thumb they want you to be as perfect as possible so they can presenter the world and say you look I&rsquo;m doing a great job of parenting when they&rsquo;re actually not. The thing is that prolong abuse results in depression anxiety trust issues so on and so forth. As for the depression, she could be suffering from postpartum and not know it, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll get the medication that she needs because of her belief system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im sad that shes listening to John Piper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt sorry for Jessa before but now I do. I don&rsquo;t know how they feel about psychologists or counselers, but I do know that kind of treatment costs money and you know how they are about money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome üòçüíã üíùüíñ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s only some sects that believe you can&rsquo;t use medicine- I&rsquo;m a Christian and the ELCA is pro LGBTQ, and has no issues with psychiatry or medicine. Actually I thank God I was raised in a part of the church where how you treat others and care for yourself were always emphasized.</p>

<p>I stopped following Nick and unsubscribed from his channel a long time ago.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t make ourselves perfect, what Gothard taught is unlivable.  Jessa will come out of this struggle a better person, when she does some realizing. I hope she will talk to Jill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please look into Phil and Alex Congliere on youtube!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Postpartum depression anyone??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really feel for the Duggar kids. I can understand why Jessa is struggling. I wish one of them would come out, or go to college or divorce (Joy). I think she is in an abusive marriage. If not abusive she is definitely not respected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weird somehow I ended up unsubscribed, this wasn‚Äôt in my subscriptions only the recommended ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<li>
<p>I think Paris is a human like all of us. We all have issues, some more than others because of our parents/family pressure. I‚Äôve always had a feeling that she was a kind person behind all of that glitter. I‚Äôm so happy to hear she is doing something good with her ‚Äúfame.‚Äù  I‚Äôm a fan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Off topic.. Props to you for having such thick skin &amp; GREAT CONTENT!!! I‚Äôm so sick of these disgusting haters on the internet talking smack about people they don‚Äôt even know.. I love you &amp; I love your channel &amp; I will defend you until the day I die.. #meanpeoplesuck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call police on one and ambulance for the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See she is a tad confusing and I will tell you why. If you watch the Jessa and Jill interview with Megan Kelly you will feel a totally different way. She was straight up hood. This women didnt let anything bother her. She let it run off her and didnt look back. Watch Jill and you will see her totally break down and Jessa is going to shed a tear, and she didnt. Not even close. Not for one second. She could have changed, this is true.. How would i feel if that was my brother that did those nasty things to me and my sister and Josh got away with all of it because their parents sided with him,  the child molester. For those parents to not protect their daughters makes me sick. Josh is worth more to them then all of their daughters put together. These parents are so sick. All over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow&hellip;speaking on Jessa that was way to much pressure to have on someone so young. It seems like she was expecting a &ldquo;spiritual enlightenment&rdquo; at such a young age. Most of that sort of self/spiritual enlightenment only comes with life experiences. Learning about yourself and learning to love yourself as who you are today not what other people think you &ldquo;should&rdquo; be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical depression really skews the way you perceive things.  It also brings with it guilt, confusion, hopelessness and a whole lotta self doubt.  Sufferers try so hard to ‚Äúfix‚Äù themselves which is basically impossible to do if you are truly suffering from depressive disorder.  For many people, a combination of meds and therapy can really help people to get out of the fog and become capable of living a satisfying life.</p>

<p>Katie how is your best friend doing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We sent my cousin to Provo canyon in Utah. It was the worst mistake ever. She is so much more lost now and the abuse she endured while there was horrible. My mother and Aunt both worked for Disney at that time so it was recommended and paid for. This was in 1999. We ended up pulling her out because her behavior got worse.  Breaks my heart. Thank you for bringing these stories to us Katie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And this is why I‚Äôm more spiritual now than Catholic. I can never measure up. Perfection ‚ÄúGod‚Äù doesn‚Äôt walk this earth. I‚Äôd like to know as someone who has BPD personality would</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like to know how to have a relationship with God someone I can‚Äôt see. It‚Äôs not about God .. it‚Äôs about the age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt follow the show but my sister lives in northwest Arkansas and has seen some of the Duggar‚Äôs our and about multiple times. She said every time she has seen Jessa she doesn‚Äôt look happy and no one would dare approach her. I don‚Äôt think she wants to live a public life and I don‚Äôt know why she continues to do the show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG üòçüíã üíùüíñ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around Easter one of my friends who is &lsquo;born-again&rsquo; did a video for her Instagram on her &ldquo;come to Jesus&rdquo; story. And she honestly is such a sweet and loving person, I know she is a true believer and is trying to spread something positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But when listening, I couldn&rsquo;t get passed the fact that at four years old, she was convinced by her church and family that she was bad. That she had something to repent for. Now she doesn&rsquo;t express it exactly like that, but it&rsquo;s what it meant. 4-year-olds don&rsquo;t understand nuance so &ldquo;sinner&rdquo; or whatever just means &ldquo;bad&rdquo; to them. I just felt sad for her when she was talking about it, even though she says now that she&rsquo;s an adult she &ldquo;understands God more and believes that nothing she does would stop God from loving her&rdquo; it just seems so awful for such a small child to truly believe that they are bad and have to repent. And apparently this message is very common in these Christian circles. Actually, I feel like Jinger Duggar once even talked about this-she said she was six when she &ldquo;realized she was a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nick and Orland have serious eating disorders. Yes, their fights are fake, but you can see physically they are struggling and obviously mentally. They need to quit YouTube before they lose years off of their lives.

<p>No medical care. Do you not remember Josie?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome that Paris is doing that. I went to a horrific boarding school in 94 that was similarly as bad. Long story short two boys ended up killing another &amp; those boys went to prison where one died recently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the stuff with Nick is completely trolling. I just can&rsquo;t believe people are still watching the crap. He learned from Trisha. That&rsquo;s exactly what she does. She knows if she is controversial that she gets views and Nick is doing the same. No one would really put that online if it was happening. Its nuts. But people watch it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nope</p>
</li>

<p>My  older of my two brothers and I used to fight as kids when we. Became older we ended up working together  have some mutual friends  my brother was friends with my husband before I  knew him  so joked at my wedding in his best man speech  my husband only dated me to hangout more with him lol  my youngest brother n  i flight even though I‚Äôm 12 years older  probably more that I mothered him a bit not because my mum made me like Jana but because I just am that way I work in childcare.  Yes  siblings fight no matter the age gap. I feel  for  the Duggar girls like Jessa.  It‚Äôs sad she feels that way I hope they realise they can get help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just watched the Paris Hilton documentary trailer. Will definitely check this out on September 14th. This just shows you never really knows what someone has gone through, rich or poor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YT won‚Äôt notify if a creator pumps 3+ videos in 24 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God makes us in his image. We don‚Äôt have to be anything else. I‚Äôve been through enough bs in my life. I get Jessa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for christians in general, especially fundies, because they do not really seem to believe in depression or other mental illnesses. They seem to have a &ldquo;pray it away&rdquo; attitude or say things like if you feel that way you are not &ldquo;godly enough&rdquo;. I am an atheist and am sooooo glad that I believe in science and medicine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expression you are looking for is &ldquo;flat affect&rdquo; which is what Jessica has all the time.  No joy, no excitement, no real anger, no real depression (because that would represent a failure), no curiosity&hellip;but lots of rules, tons of rules, to follow.  Whether it&rsquo;s PTSD, PPD, depression or disassociation, Jessa has conditioned herself to feel very little if not nothing.  She doesn&rsquo;t look good either, after an adolescence where she actively enjoyed make up and hair and what clothing they were allowed to wear, she doesn&rsquo;t appear to have anything she enjoys anymore.  Yes, there is a lot to feel pity for here&hellip;but ultimately Jessa made the choice to pursue god and only god from the bible as her source for all answers.  She is an adult.  She has mountains of resources online where she could look for symptoms of depression and the psychological consequences of being abused by her parents, sexually abused by her brother.   Instead, she and Ben would rather judge the world as a big ol&rsquo; pit of sin and avoid doing things as innocuous as attending Ben&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s graduation from the police academy, because women shouldn&rsquo;t work!  I can&rsquo;t feel sorry for her.  Jinger has reached out to the world to find answers.  Jill is embracing the outside resources the world has to offer.  Jessa could as well, no matter what her childhood, but she refuses so she can be the best Christian Evah!  Oh well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy is too gross. I lost interest in seconds. No thank you. Sorry. I‚Äôll catch you on a different one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well jessa needs to get help for herself. I don‚Äôt even like her anyways. I do feel bad for her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She never said she was in clinical depression, what she said was spiritual depression. Two totally different things. Some children are just perfectionists and put that pressure on themselves. I have a child that is this way. So do not sit behind your keyboard &amp; judge if she is happy or not. That is your opinion &amp; she does not need your pity or gossip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jessa should start to see outside the world of god and christians, simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have Josie who has serious medical issues.  There was an episode when she was a baby and JB and Michelle left her with the older girls.  She almost died.  I think she has seizures.  Also they treat Josie like turds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think meds are only good for clinical depression, not existential depression.  So, if Jessa was having existential depression, all the meds in the world would not have done any good.  I think Jessa was having existential depression in her teen years.  She probably was having post-partum depression after having given birth to Spurgeon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh poor Paris&hellip;.. Welcome to the real world w punishments that like you know real world people endure except you know far worse  for not rich folks typically. Ooo you got bullied and couldn&rsquo;t pay your way out ohh boo hoo oh boo so sad. The SA and drugging not ok. But some of  these kids that are so entitled need to know what having NO privledge is really like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its funny everybody is talking about what they should or shouldn‚Äôt do and at the same time talking about that everyone should be free to choose. If you don‚Äôt agree with them then don‚Äôt watch it and stop gossiping and talking bad about them and things that you don‚Äôt know anything about since you don‚Äôt know them personally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to live that life they choose that so stop complaining!!
