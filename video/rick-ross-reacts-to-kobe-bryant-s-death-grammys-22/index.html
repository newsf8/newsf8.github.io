<p>Wasnt even a Kobe fan hated how he tore up my blazers 5-6 times a year. But shit News instantly had me in tears. R.i.p Mamba</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im telling you life is to short to worry about others. Do you and quit trying to impress others, you never know when your time is up. Get off the coach and accomplish your goals!!! your time is clicking. rip kobe :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIANNIA WOULD HAVE BEEN A LEGEND!!! rest easy mamba and mamba jr.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person giving the interview knows how to do her damn job. She did amazing and very professional</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in Peace to Kobe, his daughter and all other passengers of this crash. my deepest condolences &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feeling sick after hearing this i love you kobe and giannia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our thoughts are with you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even keep up with sports at all, and his death still hit me like a rock. He will be missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never mistreat others life is too short. Let&rsquo;s end all hate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The secret to immortality is living a life worth remembering.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-Bruce Lee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe will forever be remembered so he will always be living. #MAMBAMENTALITY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legends never die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really depressing, as a tribute to Kobe, anytime you crumple up paper and throw it in the trash and say Kobe</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Never stop doing it, we cannot forget about such a legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During elementary school people would ask me “who is your favorite athlete” I would always respond with kobe, even though I never really watched a game of basketball, but I learned how amazing and talented this man was when I started to grow older. Thank you for everything Kobe, you will always be missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He and his daughter got their wings today as well as the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m 34, Kobe was an idol of mine as a child and teen and my god he was a wonderful man not just a wonderful athlete. He was a generous philanthropist, a loving friend to so many and a dedicated father that did everything for his family and kids. I was at work bartending when I found out and I had to sit down and cry. My customers understood and I wasn&rsquo;t the only one with tears in his eyes. This just doesnt make sense and this is a great loss for the world. I pray that he held his daughter in those final moments and I hope he had the time to tell her he loved her and reassured her shed be okay  even though he knew they wouldn&rsquo;t be. I pray for his family and for everyone the cared for this man. He was taken to soon. God has certainly gained 2 Angels today.

<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s such awful news, so many other celebs also reacted to his death on twitter and I put it into a video if anyone didn&rsquo;t see the reactions :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They wear shades to hide what they lost to selling out , they all have no feelings at all even if was their mamma or kids who get Sacrificed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel sick first they said 5 now there are 9 dead at the scene</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect to Rick for this.  Rip mamba.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless him and his daughter. May they take them to Paradise on the wings of angels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P To One of The Greats and to Gianna and All those who passed on the Helicopter accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope Rick Ross win something he deserves it his music is really on point, the best album of the year, May Kobe Rest with the Ancestors until it&rsquo;s his time to return</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are these deaths always happen right before the Grammys night is my question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hadn&rsquo;t really listened to Rick Ross being interviewed before. He is very well spoken and truly is a BOSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feels like someone punched me in the stomach. RIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish they cancelled the Games and Grammys tonight we can’t deal with the loss of Kobe Bryant and daughter in our minds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace to Kobe and his daughter, and everyone who passed today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a kid, I hated Kobe, he used to just run over my favorite team. But, as I grew older, I realized how much he loves the game. And I have nothing but respect to this man. Thank you, Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve know Kobe and his family when he live in Italy R.I.P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;KOBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&rdquo;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>(every time I take a basketball shot with trash I&rsquo;m throwing away in the trashcan)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most important thing is to be in faith,  belief of Jesus Christ. That&rsquo;s all that matters in the end. All else is null and void. Christ was the only person who walked a life of perfection and left the best legacy.

<p>“It’s is said it will be a very powerful night” that sounds weird.. hummm!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE WORLD LOVE ❤️ YOU KOBE ! 🏀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I prefer to believe that Kobe has assembled a ghost team to fight evil😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I find it very weird that there is always a big death around when it&rsquo;s grammy awards , but RIP to Kobe , his daughter and the other victims in the crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The leaked live stream video from his daughter&rsquo;s phone of the helicopter ride was terrifying&hellip; the yelling, screaming, then silence as the phone and everything else was destroyed in the blaze was so surreal to hear. So sad :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing how we idolize these multi millionaire sportsmen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was near in tears. But im very sad a great man like Kobe was called to the lord so soon. # in shock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is short.  Make it count and love those around you.  Kobe will be missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent interview. It&rsquo;s hard enough to spontaneously interview on camera, but in the wake of internationally devastating news. She did an excellent job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shout-out to all my Aquarius out there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip to a legend, a star, and an inspirational❤Fly high you will never be forgotten👼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That day I had my cousin come over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a respectful interview ♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn. Rick looks good. The news about Kobe was heartbreaking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought Rick Ross was dead 💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I gotta stop getting my news from Fifty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woooo, this hit me similar to the death of Michael Jackson it feels so unreal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am sad 😞🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

<p>Nipsy..then Kobe&hellip;I can&rsquo;t</p>

<li>
<p>It surprises me how many wealthy people intentionally move to the west coast when</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they could easily work in some other place.   I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t pay me enough to live in LA or San Francisco or anywhere in between.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential for natural disasters on that coast are wayyyy higher than I would want to risk.</p>

<p>I heard it on the radio in broken snippets where suddenly the name Kobe came out of the conversation. I thought it was some kind of prank at first then a repeat broadcast started without interruption. So sad and tragic. Condolences to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers.🙏🙏🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguably one of the best to ever play the game, for me, he comes next after MJ, but this is too heartbreaking 😭😭😭😭😭😭, I pray God comfort his wife, his daughters, and his extended family, so so sad. REST IN PEACE LEGEND</p>
