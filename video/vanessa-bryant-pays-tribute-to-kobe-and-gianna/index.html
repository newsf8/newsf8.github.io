<li>
<p>Everyone needs to respect Vanessa&rsquo;s privacy&hellip;this must be devastating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She must feel dead herself because she lost her husband, and a child&hellip;her kids must be devastated losing a father, and a sister.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can just imagine Kobe looking into Gigis eyes and knowing it was all about to end. That he couldn&rsquo;t save his little girl no matter what. Just holding her knowing that theres going to be no going foward. It all happened so fast it&rsquo;s just so heartbreaking. That&rsquo;s what makes me cry, the thought of how scared they both were, damn. . .💜💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughter that passed was the one that looked the most like her daddy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t even comprehend how scared those kids were in the helicopter. Condolences to the friends and family of everyone involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa lost her husband AND her daughter. She deserves nothing but love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can’t even imagine what she’s feeling at all. Losing her husband of almost 20 years and her 13 year old daughter &hellip;. praying for all the families 💜💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m still in shock about Kobe Bryant, his daughter and all the other people that died with them in the helicopter. I’m still so sad 😞 about the whole thing. May their souls rest in perfect peace and may God comfort their families amen. 🙏🏾 #GirlDad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a tragedy. Kobe was rich and famous, but he stayed humble and always was willing to help those in need. He will truly be missed by millions. Rest up big bro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t even imagine her pain because she lost her husband and her daughter! She deserves nothing but love and prayers for her and her family.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>But please don’t forget the families of the people who were in this helicopter as well..😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around Vanessa losing her daughter and looking to her husband to console her only to be reminded he too is also gone. Unimaginable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imagine losing a child and then not having your husband there to mourn with you and comfort you. absolutely heart breaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope those that died, died instantly. Didn’t feel pain. Didn’t watch the aftermath or their loved ones already dead. I’m still at a lost for words and I didn’t even know any of them. May they all Rest In Peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;Husband, wife and child who also were in the helicopter&hellip;and everyone else😥😥. It&rsquo;s very hard for their families to deal with it. They deserve LOVE AND SUPPORT 😥😥😥🙏🏾.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart goes out to all the families of the people who died in the crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He accepted death but I dont think he accepted watching his daughter in fear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is beyond sad and deviating! I can’t imagine the grief this woman is experiencing and the rest of the people that lost their lives in this devastating loss! We should be more kind and loving towards each other! Hug your kids and family members!! Rip Kobe and Gianna!!! May God be with and the family members that lost their lives!!

</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe, isn’t dead. He just woke up from this dream into his next experience&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn rip mamba everyone is hurting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip his daughter and everybody else who died in the helicopter😞🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s also remember there are 4 other families grieving just as much as the Bryant family. One of those lost both of their parents and a sister. Two kids without parents. So so sad!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m just curious on why all gossip sites can’t just let her mourn right now. Why does she have to be under a microscope. It’s just sad. The fact she had to learn about it because of TMZ it’s just all so disturbing. I’m here V.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew that the accident was cause there was no terrain module to alert the pilot how low the pilot was to the hills beforehand. Those type of helicopters don&rsquo;t have the terrain input. The helicopters that do have them are usually military helicopters. My information provided to me are from some of my friends who are military.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the twinkling of an eyeJesus will come back with his Angels. That&rsquo;s his promise 🙏🌻 keep holding on to his word dear lady .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the people who pressed the &ldquo;thumbs down&rdquo; icon, exactly what are they disliking? She did it wrong? She missed something? Or they just don&rsquo;t like her or Kobe?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It feels too weird. The fact that he’s gone, idk I’ve never experienced something like this. It’s just too weird.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t even imagine how vanessa and others daughters feeling right now&hellip; its totally devastating and heartbroken for me.. how about them ? Well, stay strong for everyone in the world :,) i know it would be hard very very hard to get trough this. What a heartbreaking early year for everyone :’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know this pain I lost my only son December 2019 tragically in a car that burnt is only God can take us trough this I pray strength for the rest of the family 🙏🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest In Peace Kobe Bryant ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“vanessa pays tribute” like click bait much. the video had nothing to do with that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What sucks even more is that his daughter GiGi died way too young. She never got a chance to become an adult, never got a chance to ride her own set of wheels, never got a chance to have her own kids, and so much more. It just sucks😥 R.I.P to Kobe, his baby girl GiGi, and everyone else that has lost their lives on that helicopter crash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they leave her the tf alone my God she&rsquo;s grieving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHY the hell is the reporter asking Kobe, a relatively young man about &ldquo;Death&rdquo;@ 1:58?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>please just let her grieve in peace. we don’t need to know this stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two thousand feet a minute, dear God in heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Vanessa and the girls need anything, LA is there for them. Just like Kobe was there for us 💛💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my heart is praying for Kobe Bryant family especially his parents the two  people who brought him in the world  y&rsquo;all deserve some praise so thank you any may God continue to cover y&rsquo;all

<li>
<p>Am praying for all the families who lost loved one in this accident.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>There’s been 6,969 days since the year 2000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VANESSA has SO MUCH ON HER SHOULDERS RIGHT NOW TO THINK ABOUT. SHE DOESN&rsquo;T NEED ANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS AROUND HER OR TOWARD HER FAMILY.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHE IS GRIEVING LIKE THE OTHER FAMILIES. GOD BLESS HER  family AND THE OTHER FAMILIES for thier loss. GOD BE WITH THE SOULS WHO WERE LOSS ON THE HELICOPTER.  IN JESUS NAME AMEN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cannot imagine what’s its like to be going through something like this&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s been in her life for so long and they had 4 kids&hellip;I just can’t imagine the pain she’s enduring. 😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace Kobe Bryant, Gianna and all seven people that died</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i was so heartbroken when i saw her profile picture bc it’s literally so cute 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa will be in shock for many years. I pray that she will find a bit of happiness in the coming years. Her beautiful daughters will keep her alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sad thing is i never heard jusus christ mentioned in any of this fact is this is a wake up call to anyone unsaved</p>

<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine what his kids are feeling and their mom 😥. Losing a very young daughter/sister and dad in such pain too&hellip;.it&rsquo;s more than horrible 😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a time where media should leave their family alone to mourn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip all who died ❤️❤️💔💔 and prayers for family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will all reunite again when the time comes&hellip;they&rsquo;re just gone from this physical world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow 😮 Kobe was a great dad amagine his other daughters and the new one and venessa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the twinkling of an eyeJesus will come back with his Angels. That&rsquo;s his promise 🙏🌻 keep holding on to his word dear lady .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine not seeing your child and husband not coming home everyday this is more than sad. The same thing happened to my grandma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Our hearts and minds STILL with Kobe Bryant and his family&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&ldquo;still&rdquo; ??? Bro you say STILL like it eventually isn&rsquo;t going to be. It&rsquo;s FOREVER going to be, get your words right. For real&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip kobe and Gianna it started on my birthday and that was not my favorite day stay strong Vanessa we love ya&rsquo;all ❤❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all a trip let this lady be in piece</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hero&rsquo;s come and go, but legends are forever. R.I.P to a Young legend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all gotta give her a break guys, not only that she lost Kobe she lost her 13 year old daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awww, I though this would just be solely about the tribute from Vanessa for her loved ones. All the rest of this I&rsquo;ve seen in other footage&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How sad, with a broken heart I can&rsquo;t imagine how Vanessa, her daughter and the rest of the family feel at this moment because she loses her husband and daughter at the same time. R.I.P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Watch your Jet Bro, watch your Jet Bro, WATCH YOUR JET&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like I want to live with Kobe in the afterlife</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing this to help someone. I lost my husband in an awful car crash that was caused by a drunk driver. It was 8 days before Christmas. He and I have 2 children. I come from a big family and he was in the military. I was swarmed with well wishers and family. While they all had good intentions what I needed most was time with my children and quietness. I needed to seek strength from a higher power than myself as I was at a complete loss in how to handle this time. The person I loved and trusted the most in life was gone.  I was paralyzed by fear at first but my faith was my saving grace. Respect this wife more than a dollar and allow her to heal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe was suppose to get old, own a team and watch his daughters play basketball. Damn it not like this 😢😭 #imbroken

</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t let these clowns try to cover it up, the news and media are covering it up. Kobe was in a lawsuit with the pharmaceutical company. And all of the sudden his helicopter just crashes? It was planned. RIP Kobe ❤️🕊</p>

<p>God is the way the truth and the  light  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏for all the families  God bless us all💙💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everybody has already moved on from this ballhog!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish the pilot had declared an emergency and would have allowed the air traffic controller to guide him out of the mess that he got himself into.  Ego can and will kill.  Knowing when to ask for help is the difference between life and death specially when you have eight other lives depending on you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😢💔😫 This extremely breaks my heart. My heart and prayers go out to Venessa and all of the families who lost their loved ones in that crash. 😞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can only imagine what she’s going through my thoughts and prayers go out to the families, I have a sister named Gianna and I have a four-year-old daughter and I can only imagine how Kobe must’ve felt during his last moments with his daughter as a father I know exactly what they’re going through daddy’s girl will always be the same. What a horrible tragic accident but legends never die I’ll be praying for you Vanessa and the rest of the seven victims we lost. 💛💜🙏🏼💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant imagine how kobe protected his child before it getting worst. Condolence to byant family.Be strong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless, may they all rip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was never been a fan or known Kobe, but heart aches for Kobe, and my eyes constantly crying for Vanessa and her children. 💕🥰🌹❤️🙏🙏😂😂😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is such a tragedy. Life is so precious. Every minute is important. It&rsquo;s time I make my life count for something. #Mamba4Life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, Gigi was so young&hellip;.

<p>Every time I watch one of these tribute videos I begin to get tears in my eyes and begin to think again how life is so beautiful but so short. I hope there is an afterlife. Rest In Peace Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip Kobe and Gigi,,,and to the other 7 people on the plane that lost their life..so tragic</p>
</li>

<p>Kobe Bryant’s Body may have died, but his legacy will live forever🙏🏻🙏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sorry for your loss! With all the good things you&rsquo;re doing with the flowers being into the plants those basketballs should go to the young kids who cherished him and love him. A donation of that magnitude and for the kids the feel that special feeling would be so great. After all he was an inspiration to all the young kids. For them to have a piece of somebody that they loved and cherished would be so great. Again so sorry for your loss and God bless your family</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>What a tragedy!  His  family is beautiful ! My heart goes out to them ! How did God  let this happen ? Maybe it was the fault of  you know who !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy doesn’t give AF about Vanessa or Kobe, just ratings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe, isn’t dead. He just woke up from this dream into his next experience&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing Shaq in tears shakes me. Always got that great, big, gold heart right there on his sleeve.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I’m not much if a basketball fan, but Kobe Bryant was a really special human, on and off the court. He passed away too soon, just doing his dad thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life is so short we needs to love one another ❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine what she might be going through. God, bless the bryants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have to be strong for your family and friends and 💟🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You never know when you&rsquo;re gonna go but know you are gonna be missed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disheartening 😞🙏❤ i will put this energy to do something positive for someone. Then say pray for Kobe&rsquo;s family and pay it forward sis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine the pain one must go through losing your loved ones like this or even losing your loved ones. I feel like I&rsquo;ve been blessed to not have that happened to me yet. My prayers go out to Kobe&rsquo;s family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t believe he’s dead. I was stunned when I saw the headline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not wish this upon any woman may God comfort Vanessa hugs ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This breaks my heart but they said they found Gianna in Kobe’s arms😭😭😢😢😓</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>This was one of the saddest day&rsquo;s of my entire life.Rip to every soul lost #Black #Mamba 4ever</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I really hope Vanessa and the rest of the Bryant family are able to enjoy plenty of privacy and quiet while they grieve. The last thing they need right now is a bunch of strangers and paparazzi nuts bothering them and demanding quotes every 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ooh my God ,😭,let God&rsquo;s comfort be upon this family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thing that breaks my heart, was that 3 young girls lost their lives that day.</p>

<p>Kobe was assassinated, may he &amp; his daughter rest in peace ☹💔</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Rip idol Kobe Bryant and Gigi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish Kobe Bryant family&rsquo;s all the blessing&rsquo;s and I like the picture of her and her dad together and she looking up at her dad smiling in Kobe Bryant looking down at his daughter smiling back  it&rsquo;s sad what happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine what she is going through, may she along with the other families find peace and may God bless and heal them through this trying time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow. Idk they were childhood sweethearts.  This is beyond tragic.  May her ❤heart heal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: grammar</p>
</li>
<li>

I’m so sorry for this horrible tragedy and pray that you and your family will have the privacy you so need and deserve at this difficult time in your lives. My prayers and thoughts go out to you all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So very very very Sad. My sincerest condolences to the families. 😞 Safety 1st people always. Make sure that your vehicles are equipped with everything that you need. And heed the weather warnings. There was very heavy fog that day, and one forecaster said that it was equivalent to flying through &ldquo;a  river of milk&rdquo;. A game or a wedding or whatever is just not worth your life.

<p>Truly heartbreaking for all the families, I do not care what relationship you have with your children, it will almost kill a parent to have a child die 1st and so suddenly. To Kobe&rsquo;s parents and all the parents, siblings, family members, friends, fans who had loved ones on the plane, I pray peace and that you find some measure of comfort in your memories 🙏🏾.</p>
