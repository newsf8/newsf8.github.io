<li>
<p>I wish they’d stop repeatedly asking Shaq the same questions. He’s already spoke on his feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these interviewers need to like leave shaq a lone and stop asking him about Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how they said “Gianna and Kobe Bryant” give honours to her name first since she was so young and didn’t get to live her life. That’s the way her father would’ve wanted it aswell I reckon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LEAVE SHAQ ALONE JESUS!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>y’all really need to leave shaq alone dude. let the man grieve in peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe didn&rsquo;t chase the dream, he lived it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am concerned for Shaq. He lost a lot of loved ones in a short space of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jeez I’m more worried for Kobe’s Wife right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After she said how are you processing through this, and once he said I&rsquo;m not.. they should have just ended it. Media is shady</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor shaq. I feel when the funerals role around, that he&rsquo;ll break down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is so sad. GiGi had such an amazing career ahead of her. Kobe still had much to teach her. I cannot not believe that either one of them died. Kobe was still young. Gigi was incredibly young. If you would like, say a prayer for everyone who died in the crash. 😪🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😪</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>feel for Shaq having to listen to that aimless interviewer spewing out empty questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s hard to accept it’s like we lost a family member</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t believe this tbh. Can&rsquo;t be the only one right? Rip Kobe and his daughter😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That reporter literally had to put her neck at a 90 degree angle just to talk to Shaq.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its obvious he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about it. leave the man alone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its time to stop interviewing&hellip;same questions &hellip;to emotionally overwrought people&hellip;.especially Shaq and LeBron</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enough!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Shaq said he&rsquo;d take care of Kobe&rsquo;s family

<li>
<p>how many times is ET going to interview shaq?? leave the grieving man alone!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is hard to adjust may the Lord give all the family peace in their heart may the Lord give Shaquille O’Neal a Peace in his heart This is a shocking Kobi Was a great example this shows life is too short love your family ❤️🙏🏽✝️ We come from ashes we go to ashes may the Lord receive them in Heaven all the nine lives ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interviewers are literally going to drive shaq insane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bron was NEVER the alpha dog, when Kobe was in the room‼️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has been so painful. I still can&rsquo;t believe it 😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please Jesus, give us back Kobe and you can have Harvey Weinstein in return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get over it&hellip;.All of ya&hellip;&hellip;1000 people died while typing this..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will always keep all 9 members on that helicopter crash in my thoughts and my prayers online with his family and her family may God bless them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let’s not forget about the others that also died in the crash RIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prayers to the families who lost a dear one last Sunday in this tragic accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe, you are missed. Gianna sweet angel, you had so much ahead of you with your Basketball talent..R.I.P all on that fateful flight 😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these interviewers need to like leave shaq a lone and stop asking him about Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On me and my African brothers&rsquo; behalf, every one here sends our best wishes and condolences&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KOBE WILL LIVE FOREVER IN MY HEART!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tell my children I love them every single time one of us walk out the door!  Life is short.  RIP Kobe &amp; GiGi💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superman is barely able to hold it together with his 2 recent passing&rsquo;s to those he loved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first people to acknowledge that 7 other people died that day. Just because he was famous doesn’t mean the the other’s lives weren’t any less inherently valuable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He played for the Los Angeles Lakers now he will be playing for Los Angeles in heaven. R.I.P. the Legend Kobe Bryant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On minute 1:17- Not a cross, gender symbol for female.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In life love hard!!! Life is short koby walk with god and don&rsquo;t look back

<li>
<p>Its disrespectful in my opinion for reporters to be asking Shaq about Kobe&rsquo;s passing, its obvious he&rsquo;s hurt so just leave him alone and let him move on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP KOBE&amp;GIANNA+THE OTHER PASSENGERS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it just me or does LeBron make everything about him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The happy music playing over shaq’s interview made me cry/laugh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really beginning to accept the reality.. finding solace in the excellence left behind by Kobe. Learn from him and push forward with Mamba Mentality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing him smile makes my heart hurt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear Jared Dudley is secretly in his 40s 😂😂😂💜💛🏀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those poor children didn&rsquo;t have a chance 😔😔😔💜💛💜💛💜💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear if Bloomberg was part of the superbowl, I&rsquo;m gonna go nutz ..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Bloomberg is becoming worse than the coronavirus going on &hellip; if anyone votes for Bloomberg..shame on them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:15 I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was the female gender symbol not a cross but whatever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A message: we forgot Kobe but we will forget him in our hearts ♥️ I LOVE ❤️ you Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The young man did a good job running with the. Foottball. On the Superbowl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please leave Shaq alone while he grieves, he clearly didn&rsquo;t like being interveiwed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is BS with these interviewers asking the same damn thing.  poor Shaq.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all have a day here in Earth. Seek God  stop 🛑 and do good. Be humble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Men have money everything. Cars collection wouuu. he took nothing that teach us something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq is a special guy.  You can tell being a military brat helped make home an incredibly well rounded and loving man.  Proud Shaq stopped through the bayou on his way to become this loving legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to get a shirt made with Kobe and Gianna’s beautiful faces on it

<p>The witch craft an idol worship right in front of our faces people are just zombies literally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant believe the pain that Gianna&rsquo;s oldest sister is going through she literally hyperventilated when she heard the news I&rsquo;m trying my best not to cry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish they’d stop repeatedly asking Shaq the same questions. He’s already spoke on his feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone should watch Shaq closely 😣I&rsquo;m scared for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like a legend Said “ heroes come and go &hellip;.. but legends are forever “</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still cant believe it&hellip; I find myself at work everyday just in disbelief for a few moments&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:17 uh&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s the symbol for the female gender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful show of respect from the NFL, The Celebrities, the whole 🌎, giving an incredible tribute to Kobe &amp; Gianna Bryant and the other 💘 one&rsquo;s in the 🚁. We will forever keep them in our ❤. Prayers &amp; 💘 go to their families.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>When I think about kobe I&rsquo;m asking    myself &ldquo;is that really happened?&rdquo; It feels like it&rsquo;s unreal&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so upset this has all happened 😭😭😭 but I just wanted to point out that 1:44 is just&hellip;well the only thing that sorta made me laugh but still I still can get over the fact that kobe and Gigi and the other 7 people have died&hellip;god clearly had a better place for them 😭🙏🙏😇</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Wicca symbol for women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember being 19 years old working at the famous Varsity downtown Atlanta, Georgia and Brian Nichols killed four court employees before he had a come-to-jesus moment and turned himself in. The year was 2005. I wept as I watch my favorite team disintegrate. Eating chili cheese fries in the breakroom, I watch CNN instigate the beef between Kobe and Shaq by broadcasting the drama. The family was destroyed, a trade ensued, You know the rest.. . Shaq and Kobe FOREVER♡♡♡♡💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for the 2 kids that lost their mother,father,and sister.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq Repeating himself in every interview 😂😂😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Shaq said he&rsquo;d take care of Kobe&rsquo;s family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOW DO PEOPLE DISLIKE THIS MEMORIAL!? Rest In Peace Gianna and Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t even a football  ball player</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s dead yeah it was sad but who really cares?? You guys are all sheep! Wake up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is pretty telling as to whaf really happened

<p>You know what’s eerie? Gigi kinda looks like Aaliyah and they both left in similar fashion. A lot people cried over this incident, grown men, I also have to say this is the first incident by a celeb and someone who I have never met that really hit me deep. I was in such shock and disbelief, I really felt for Kobe &amp; his daughter, I send my respects to all the victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can this reporter have a little more respect?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaq lost a friend&hellip; someone close&hellip; of course he still in pain, it hasn&rsquo;t passed more than a week.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t the media just be respectful in this cases?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we&rsquo;re still on his death?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when i heard that he died my uncle told me and i thought he got mixed up with someone else but i found out that he was actually gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing way to pay homage to Kobe, Gianna and the other victims of the helicopter crash! May y&rsquo;all Rest in peace!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it when someone famous dies they are on the TV for the next month or two and when a citizen dies it&rsquo;s just another day Kobe is just another person yes it&rsquo;s tragic but  it&rsquo;s life get use to it we are all on borrow time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s so annoying!! You see Shaq in pain and your still trying to ask questions!!!😡😡 HAVE SOME SYMPATHY! Y’all do anything for clout and money SMH 🤦🏾‍♀️😡</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: R.I.P. Gianna, Kobe, and all of the other victims!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is great and all but&hellip; where&rsquo;s sweet victory for the ocean man?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave Shaq alone already let him grieve enough with the Interviews he already told y&rsquo;all everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Cant Understand Why The Legends Dies???!!!!</p>

He spoke on his feelings already lets just show him love and pray for him for during this hard period during his life. He lost his sister than a brother.I pray he remains strong and has people around him to keep in a good place.</p>

<p>RIP Kobe and GiGi. I have been watching Kobe play since I was 12 years old. I&rsquo;m 34 now. It was the only bonding moments I had with my dad and to learn of Kobe&rsquo;s close relationship with his daughter is powerful. I will miss him with all of my heart and soul. Please leave Shaq alone. He spoke on it already. Let the man grieve. He can&rsquo;t process anything because he hasn&rsquo;t been given the proper time and opportunity to. That angers me so much. Let people be human.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip kobe gone but not forgotten</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in shock&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give these people space to grieve, it’s all so fresh!!! Honor and you paparazzi and news journalist stop asking the same questions!!! RESPECT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lebron never cared about Kobe so stop being a hypocrite cuz no one believes you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe was definitely the alpha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish that the entertainment  media would just use some class and integrity and leave Shaq alone. Let the man process his grief alone without you having to get sound bites from him.</p>

<p>So why were ppl saying he didnt get a tribute also people need to leave shaq alone man hes going through it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When&rsquo;s the funeral?  Or did they already have a private one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss Kobe Bryant I think it was a great basketball player</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This makes no sense! What does Kobe have to do with football? Am I missing something? Ya’ll acting like this man was some sort of God or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rip kobe da goat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another video of y’all using Kobe’s name for clout let the man rest you don’t gotta reuse stories you already used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe HER.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big deal we all gotta dies sooner or later!! Why my older son died at the age of 11 years old his name is Cody Lee and yet no one cares how much I been through and just because some stars basketball or football players dies what make it any different how all these come into sense? Oh, because they were famous?!! We all will dies soon we all have our own expiration date so you see DEATH COMES TO US ALL💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about our troops&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how they (the superbowl people) recognized everyone in the crash but this channel is only highlighting Kobe &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; ite disappointing 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol at 2:01, Look at the height difference of Shaq and Nischelle (interviewer).</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Shaq: looking up and can&rsquo;t see her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would have been very cool if the teams stood on the 24 and 8 yard lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kaepernick designed them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time and tide wait for none&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 1:17 they had a upside down cross. That&rsquo;s that illuminati satanic stuff. They did that for Kobe&rsquo;s tribute. That circle is the necklace and the cross is the peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KOBE BRYANT WAS THE YOUNG MICHEAL JORDAN, JUST LIKE MUHAMMAD ALI WAS THE YOUNG SUGAR RAY ROBINSON!!!!! RIP 🙏😎🦋🐝</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest In Peace Kobe and Gianna Bryant. You&rsquo;re with God now. Your Wont ever be forgotten. As a person and a Legend&hellip;..
