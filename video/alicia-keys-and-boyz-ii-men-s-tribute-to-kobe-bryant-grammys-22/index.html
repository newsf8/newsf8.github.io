<li>
<p>Let’s not forget about the seven others that died along side Kobe Bryant and his daughter. May they all R. I. P.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i can’t imagine the pain the people close to him feel, especially his wife and other two kids .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so bad. His 7 month old daughter and 3yr old won’t really have memories of their dad and big sister. That breaks my heart :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P. to all the people that died and God bless Kobe pregnant wife, I can’t imagine what she’s going through right now losing not just her husband but her child as well 😪</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all know that Kobe and his daughter will never be forgotten! They are loved by the world 🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP 🕊❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about when she threw out tripple 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Former NBA legend? More like NBA legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t believe all these tribute events after he only died 24 hours ago</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please also remember the 7 others and their families who are also hurting. They may not have touched as many as Kobe but to their families they were the world!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude I&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist but it&rsquo;s kinda weird how he dies the day after lebron passed him up and the same day of the Grammys where Kobe&rsquo;s home was?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never thought I would ever feel this pain for someone I&rsquo;ve never met it&rsquo;s insane, just as I would feel with the passing of a family member . Also may the other passengers on board R.I.P including his precious daughter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m now at the stage of anger per the 5 stages of grief.  But I was bewildered when I was looking at flight data early yesterday.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The METAR  this pilot was looking at would&rsquo;ve told him preflight that they&rsquo;d be delayed.  METAR is basically all your weather and atmospheric conditions at each airport, updated every day and night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gesture at 2:15  left hand, seems very suspect to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the heck was that hand sign she did when she said we love you Kobe? Illuminati confirmed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t believe this, Kobe had so much more to give.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dear Kobe and to all the other 9 people in that helicopter, we will always love and charish you, we will always miss you, may you RIP in gods house. We pray that the rest of your family will be alright my heart goes out to them may it all be ok Lord in jesus name&hellip;.   <br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Too bad the media is not paying the same attention to the others that died. There was a JUCO baseball coach who died along with his wife and daughter, a mother and daughter from California, one of the instructors at the Mamba Academy (Who leaves behind a family) and the pilot. Just because they weren&rsquo;t celebrities does not make this the least bit less tragic for them or their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything is about money, why isn&rsquo;t her performance up. I found that to be really sweet of her, but they won&rsquo;t show the video, don&rsquo;t tell me it'&rsquo;s gonna be on VEVO?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WTF! The hellicopter goes down on Sunday, and these Mofos Up here Already, done rehearsed etc etc and IN our faces&hellip;. That was Fast!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did anyone els noticed Alicia keys hand symbols when she said &ldquo;we love you kobe&rdquo; at the grammys. if isn’t that an illuminati sacrificing shit, I do know what it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That hand signal at 2:15 Alicia Keys did don’t sit right with me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why she throw up that 666 when she said we love you Kobe smdh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They seem a little &lsquo;too&rsquo; prepared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was sacrificed thats what you paid for being with the Elite. LeBron paid Tribute to him one day before his dead, and He died the day of the Grammys coincidence?. I dont think so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:16 “We love you kobe” throws up 666 after sacrifice in plain sight smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everything was already well rehearsed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wake up people, he was sacrificed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s up w/ her hand gester at 2:15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did she do that thing with her hand when she said kobe name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:15   Look at her Hand&hellip;.. you know when you know&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sad so unreal. Rip Kobe my heart aches for their families 😔 but Alicia don’t ever sing that song again you be quiet when boys ii men is singing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for Kobe&rsquo;s family and friends, losing someone close to you his beyond painful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t stopped crying &hellip; I still cant my heart is so heavy with what happened I pray for all the families that have been touched from such a tragic thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is my testimony,  Last year I was at a West Virginia gas well being bored, so I pulled out my cell phone to look at old cars on eBay,  every once in a while I look at Ford fairlanes there, the first Fairlane that came up was a 1958 in Greenup KY so I clicked it on, then I clicked on the seller&rsquo;s other items and he had a photograph of my grandfather who died in 1958 when I was a 4 month old baby!  My grandfather was a police officer in monessen Pennsylvania back in the 1930s  there and I&rsquo;ve always lived nearby, I began to pray to God around 9 years ago for some reason about the loss of my grandfather 61 years ago with all of my heart and have had many unbelievable experiences over several years that leaves no doubts in my mind,  utmost, believe in the holy name of Jesus, repent of your rebellion, be baptized in the name of Jesus and pray to receive his word into your hearts, Amen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia keys was throwing up 666 sign. Wake up people to what is going on. Grammys are a joke. Rest in peace Kobe

</li>
<li>
<p>Repent !!! for the kingdom of Yashaya is at hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:16 Look at her hand gesture. Clear 666 sign. This was definitely an Illuminati sacrifice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She throwing up the 666</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got teary watching this. I still can’t believe he’s gone. My condolences to the Bryant family and the other families that were also affected by this tragedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all see her hand at 2:14</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s like everyone is so focused on Kobe  they don’t even notice the others that died they should’ve put his daughter up there instead of nipsey 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just got back from church that day than I hear he dead that’s sad bro💕💕</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP to Kobe, his daughter and everyone else on the helicopter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia put up the 666 symbol 2:16 something smells fishy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>İluminate killed him. she did the 666 sign with her left hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now why the f would she do that hand sign when saying r.i.p Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m just here to watch her throw up the 666 sign.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Rest in peace to Kobe his daughter and the other. Seven people who lost there life January 26 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people are forgetting about the other people that died in the crash nothing for them i guess because there not famous but they are still people to it makes me sick to be honest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Grammy Award ceremony turned into a memorial for Kobe Bryant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:15 the hand gesture confirms my intuition. They sell their souls for nothing and people give theirs away  by worshiping false idols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y&rsquo;all noticed she threw up the 6 when she said we love u Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She threw up the 666 symbols after. Stay woke people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrong Alicia Keys. There&rsquo;s 1 other thing that brings us all together, and that&rsquo;s sports. RIP Mamba</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:16 “we love you kobe.” Peep the hand 👀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@2:16 you can clearly see keys throws up a 6 but little do you know it&rsquo;s a 666 but some are blind to understand this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sad that happened, though I was more sad when Paul Walker died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When someone dies, they disappear, no matter where you look, they can&rsquo;t be found anymore, they are just gone, like dust in wind. We live our lives seconds and minutes at a time, we forget that it can all end in a blink of an eye. So love life and everyone in it because when the time is up, your loved ones only have the memories of you and how you loved them and life. God bless!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe Bryant and his daughter  with others in that crash are living after death. Never gone or goodbyes, just well see you again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nice, keys. nothin like throwing up your satanic association right in front of everyone after you say we love you kobe. you people need to open your eyes to these celebrities. go watch a call for an uprising&rsquo;s channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would&rsquo;ve been a great video if it wasnt interrupted by constant unnecessary narration???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She did the sign with her left hand 😮😮😮</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>02:15 unreal&hellip;.completely no need to assume that gesture&hellip;don&rsquo;t know what meaning could have, I&rsquo;m not into this bullshit&hellip;but clearly made on purpose and by some kind of pre-determined composure&hellip;like was sending a message&hellip;I&rsquo;m frozen guys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is a sheep n wolves clothing. Hand gestures and all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grammys Illuminati confirmed..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P. Kobe Gianna and the other passengers on the plane my Deepest condolences to all the Family 🙏🙏🙏 and Friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This hurts! I&rsquo;m still heartbroken about everyone on that helicopter 💔

<li>
<p>Don’t forget the other passengers.  Their families are hurting too 😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P to everyone that was in the helicopter 🚁 ‼️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There wasn’t a single dry eye” I didn’t see a single tear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never forget what MSNBC said on air Los Angeles n&hellip;. yea they did look it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:15 why would you need to do the Hand gesture?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Hmm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought it was love not the angel of music..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@ 2:15 why did Alicia Keyes do her hands that way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music is a Powerful, Spiritual Energy, Which Can Be Used For Good or Bad. Combine That With Those Three Sixes Alicia Keys Flashed, as She Said, &ldquo;We Love You Kobe.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m still amazed that Ariana can fit into the seat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like LOOK AT HER DRESS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actual video was just trending #1 then they just privatized it right now wtf?</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>2:15 she throws up the 666 symbol. Kobe was an Illuminati sacrifice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please explain the signage at 2:15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So your telling me nobody saw the Illuminati sign Alicia Keys was showning off while talking about #Kobe just saying something ain’t adding up here. 😢😢😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont want to be rude but dont get me wrong I Love Kobe ❤ R.I.P T^T</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but they havnt even mention Juice Wrld and hes an artist .-.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P to kobe! But those gestures are sick. Yeshua is the most powerful and only way to the next. People are waking up. The breaths are ready to return to the owner. God bless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God I cried so hard when I watched this live. Kobe did so much for the game man, it still doesn’t feel real. We love you so much Kobe.💔</p>

<p>All the celebrity well-wishers seem dark and satanic!🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are we going to ignorne the fact I. 2:15 her throwing satanic signs after saying we love you Kobe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boys 2 men coincidentally already performing alright I&rsquo;m calling this a fake illuminati ritual look at her hand @ 2:16</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP to the mother and daughter that died in the crash RIP to the other mother of 3 children waiting for her to get home RIP to Koby and GIgi Bryant and The pilot and all the 9 souls on that plane ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>oh no I&rsquo;m crying too.😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music is powerful&hellip;got me through a range of emotions and circumstances, different genres depending on the situation or state of me. A healing element for all of us no matter the race or religion. Amen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The illumanti sign at the end when alicia was done singing made me realize that I dont think kobe was saved..

<li>
<p>Alicia Keys did an amazing job at both honoring those lost and preparing the evening as the show must go on. A job well executed. Thank you 🙏</p>

<p>the elites run the industry and once  you sign with them you have to do what they say to</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a sad situation! Praying for this Family!💗🙏🏽🙏🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😭😭😭 got a teary eyes again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey ET - Why didn&rsquo;t you POST the Front Angle at 1:03 mark instead of the side view???? Why does the Hollywood elite do things in Plain Sight but then try to HIDE IT when people call them out?? What exactly was the Meaning behind the &ldquo;6&rdquo; hand sign Alicia Keys Made at the end of the song???? If it was so important why hide it??? CSTAR took their video down. Why??? If this was a TRIBUTE to Kobe - and shouldn&rsquo;t be anything more - WHY Was it Necessary for Alicia Keys to Make the Hand Gesture that the Hollywood Elite tend to make???? Once it is on the Internet - it is ALWAYS on the internet!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@2:15 666 hand gesture&hellip;. wow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am confused, I have never seen a Music award show, pay tribute to an Athlete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody see the hand symbol 🤨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As tragic as this is at a human level it is still all about bread and circus. Kobe payed his part with sincerity and dedication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did they put that together so fast it alrs months of prepping I guess they knew what was up I also Kno they had rip Kobe shirts that morning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sad I loved watching #24. Kobe Bryant play he had not only talent but such energy r.I.p mamba you will be missed

<p>The Greatest Drummer ever, Neil Peart dies a few weeks ago, but lets talk about someone who never made music on a music show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guys Kobe was sacrificed, every single person in that room is a liar, satan is real and he completely runs hollywood, all those artists have sold their soul. This is a massive show being put on and its just the TIP of the iceberg. Jesus Christ is the only way, hes the Truth the Way and the Light&hellip; God Loves you SOO MUCH and wants you out of this mind control media lifestyle. God Bless you All</p>
</li>
