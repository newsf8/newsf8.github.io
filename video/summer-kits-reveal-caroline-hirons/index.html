<p>Caroline: we‚Äôve tripled our capacity&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me: pretty sure we‚Äôll crash the site again&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this bag sadly can‚Äôt afford the kit this time been off work nearly 4 months but both kits look amazing hope everyone gets one good luck üòâ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So given the charities that will be helped with the summer kits, the beauty backed to help people in the beauty industry the generous personal donations to the black lives matter movement and countless other things Caroline has done I think our girl deserves proper recognition. adding to the New Years honour list ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And also a huge thank you to everyone behind the scenes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love that they‚Äôre going to Teachers, my best friend is a teacher and they do such a great job and often with little recognition, especially during the pandemic. Love kit 1 for myself and love the bag üòçüòçüòç.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh Caroline you‚Äôve made me cry!! Today, A level results day, where teachers assessments/grades have been undermined yet again, having come under fire for being ‚Äòselfish‚Äô for asking if it‚Äôs safe to return to normal classrooms, it‚Äôs so lovely to see someone like you, a role model to so many and a Liverpool fan, speak up for us. Thank you üòò</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish I could just purchase a bag. I can‚Äôt afford a kit. But the bags are amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an ICU RN in a covid unit, I truly appreciate you donating to NIH and teachers. I don‚Äôt live there but it is incredibly thoughtful. A huge thumbs up to you!!!!! Hats off to you!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what a woman&hellip; I mean, where on Earth will you find someone who puts THIS MUCH into what she does and she does it for all of us, for charities and for all of the beauty people out there&hellip;. Absolutely amazing kits as always, i am so so so excited and i will forever support your work Caroline. Your passion for work and support is incredible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG&hellip; In case I can&rsquo;t get a kit&hellip; ARE THESE LUSH BAGS GOING TO BE SOLD SEPERATELY? Any chance???? Pleeeeease!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a gesture!‚ù§Ô∏èthe shit that I‚Äôve read about being a slacker in lockdown for being a teacher has shocked me beyond belief. You also influenced me into doing a mass order of neon from house of neon&hellip;my bank balance is hurting,in the best possible way!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ooohhh&hellip; I called the REN cleanser and a Mother Dirt product. I‚Äôm using the Medik8 C-Tetra Intense atm - it is AWESOME! üòçüòçüòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching at 1.5 to get to the good stuff quicker!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to thank my dog for getting into a coughing fit and sounding like she was going to get sick. Turns out I didn&rsquo;t hear my alarm or snoozed it and it 10.29!  BUt nothing rises you like thinking dog is getting sick. Got my kit, Doggy is fine and getting a treat :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíï for turning down Klarna. Their whole business model is to encourage people to spend too much. When people fail a payment they will be sent to the debt recovery company Klaran owns and where Klarna make the real money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers have been amaazing! My son is autistic and at mainstream secondary school. The head of year rang me every week to ask how he was he was doing. He went in one day a week for the last half term to help with routine. I really can&rsquo;t praise them enough!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could not agree MORE about Pestle &amp; Mortar Caroline! I used to work in the beauty industry and had the opportunity to meet Sonia from P&amp;M, plus the WONDERFUL Emma Hardie on a photoshoot where I was just a (usually) invisible marketing exec, both women were BEYOND generous with their time (especially putting up with a skincare freak like me - you can imagine the questions I had!) and both were a pleasure to work with, on and off set. xxx

<li>
<p>When you work in education but not in the UK. Damn.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>And I‚Äôd be happy with just purchasing the bag, don‚Äôt even need the amazing product in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good Luck to everyone who wants a kit. I loved the spring kit and the stuff in these kits looks awesome. I made full on notes and slightly gutted to be missing some of them so might buy them separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄòOh she loves her fanny charity‚Äô - ü§£ü§£ü§£ bloody brilliant!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caroline: first of all this is all your fault ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a teacher after today&rsquo;s results (not good in tears earlier). Thank you for thinking of us. Doesn&rsquo;t happen often and most appreciated!! X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the comment about watching what gets raved about in the freaks group - tested on humans - and proud!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need just the bag!  ü§û I wish she would sell just the bags when she does these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of these kits are screaming my name!!  As though you were thinking of my angry rosacea skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good collection. ..glad the gifted kits ae again going to a good cause rather than fellow bloggers!! The effort put in coming up with these combos keeping most folks n skintypes in mind is commendable. . i could have gone &hellip;i cant afford to spend that much at one go..plus shipping n customs .good for those who can afford. ..i realise they are worth the price for consumers n good business n profit for Caroline n team.. i would  need to save up for 6 months . .needn&rsquo;t purchase again for next 6&hellip; but again moved to tret in PM  n a much simpler AM routine plus need to finish all the horded stuff &hellip;with these kits never want all products. .this time can say wouldn&rsquo;t have minded either! !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you sell just the bags?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äòm a teacher in training and when Caroline said, that some of the kits are going to the unspoken heros (the teachers) I started crying. Thank you to Caroline and her Team for recognising us. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It feels like Christmas eve!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers in schools are walking back into the unknown in September I for one feel scared but the kids will never know. Thank you for the recognition xxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a teacher I appreciate so much that you‚Äôre acknowledging our work during the pandemic. It‚Äôs been a challenge and the tough time we‚Äôve been getting from a lot of the press (and some corners of the public) has made it much harder.   Appreciation from someone as influential as you means a lot. Thank you! üôèüèª</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 20:34 Caroline says ‚Äú&hellip;there‚Äôs a big thing about hyaluronic at the moment‚Äù - what‚Äôs the big thing about hyaluronic??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching hoping I‚Äôll get a chance to get my hands on this kit this time&hellip;I was sitting in front of my computer for hours and no luck last time. Also being unlucky with the time difference far in Japanüò¥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a way of nominating a teacher Caroline?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Drops everything and watches with rapt attention</em>

<p>PS: Much love to teachers in the UK and elsewhere; you are in my thoughts and I hope you all can stay safe and sane in the next few weeks and months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So nice to think about teachers, it&rsquo;s been a tough ride especially for those with children at home who have homeschooled their own whilst safeguarding and teaching 100&rsquo;s of children from home.  There&rsquo;s been so much teacher hate online we&rsquo;ve felt disheartened.  Thank you x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i was able to snatch a kit 2 and could weep with joy!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the de mamiel skin recovery compares to may‚Äôs blue cocoon?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IM SO EXCITED! i missed out on spring but am hopeful for getting a summer kit.  I think you could pull off doing 50k kits especially if you only did spring and autumn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there likely to be a few discount codes for the brands involved? I can&rsquo;t afford a whole kit but would love to try out some of the items anyway. And the bags look amazing!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for everything, Caroline! Hoping to get my hands on Kit 1 - loved my Spring kit! :) xxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Update</em> amazingly I managed to get my hands on kit 1!!! So excited to get those products on my face! I absolutely loved all the products from the SpaceNK box last years! üíõ***</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately working tomorrow so probably won‚Äôt get my hands on the summer kit but just wanted to say you are an amazing woman Hirons!! Supporting all these charities and businesses and using your platform for good calling out our shitty government!! I work in early years. We‚Äôve been working throughout however seeing ‚Äúdaily fail‚Äù criticise ourselves and teachers for being lazy and work shy even though we‚Äôve worked every single day from home, worked in the hubs to look after the keyworkers children. Those kits mean a lot to the teachers. You angel! I hope you get the recognition you deserve! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my goodness! TEACHERS ‚ù§Ô∏è that‚Äôs incredible, thank you!! Wow üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;re selling a product, but your priorities are the charities and to discourage people getting into debt. What other retailers do that?! Bloody amazing üòÄ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is wonderful. Thank you so much for making these kits possible. I‚Äôm really hoping I can manage to snag one. Crossing my fingers and attaching my phone to my body and credit card to my face so I don‚Äôt miss it. Good luck everyone üíú‚ú®</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AMAZING KITS!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish I could afford kit 1 üò¢‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm a teacher in Denmark and often feel like our job is overlooked or that people look down on us üò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work in a special needs school and we have still been teaching all throughout lockdown, we never closed to allow our children to keep up routines and minimise frustrations. So many of my colleagues really deserve that. Wonderful of you Caroline. Such a good egg. Going for kit 2 hopefully ü§û If not I‚Äôll sulk in the freaks group üòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I work nights, but instead of sleeping after my shift, I waited till 10 AM to purchase one of the kits :) I wouldn&rsquo;t miss sleep for anyone normally:)) This is how much I love you and grateful for what you do. Thank you so much, Caroline xxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sound amazing. I talked myself out of it. I have skincare that will last me months upon months probably until the next fall winter kit if there is one. Hopefully ü§ûüèΩ I‚Äôm glad for all the donations. I know this isn‚Äôt just about my wants and needs.

Just saw this video Friday pm and alas, all kits are gone.  Maybe my union will spot me a kit. Couldn‚Äôt have afforded one anyway, because you know&hellip; teacher‚Äôs salary, coupled with childcare in the London fringe=skint!  You rock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolutely fantastic charities.  Well deserved.  Teachers this time is brilliant.  Fair play to you, your team and everyone involved  üëè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing! That bag looks fabulous! Worth setting my alarm and getting up in the middle of the night. Here‚Äôs hoping I work out the time difference correctly!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First I wanted kit 1, then kit 2, then kit 1 again! I‚Äôm so confused! 37 with normal skin, want kit one for Luna, and kit 2 for pestle and mortar!! Pls help!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAMN! I want both kits! TBH I think I am edging more towards kit 1 although I so want the Sunday Riley A+ Lol.  I think I will get Kit 1 and I will see how how my brain takes me tomorrow morning and it might be Kit 2 OR I might even have a total &lsquo;It is for the best and I need to treat myself after all I have been through&rsquo; and end up getting both Kit 1 and Kit 2? Lol. I am loving the bags especially as I love camo. I am so looking forward to tomorrow morning at 10am. Woooo Hoooo x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just incredible, the products in both kits are lovely, I really hope I&rsquo;m lucky enough to buy one tomorrow. Even more incredible are the charities chosen to benefit from the donations.  Well done team CH üòÉüòçüíû

<p>Can‚Äôt wait, hope to get my hands on the kit!</p>

<p>Good old Phil sorting out the back end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi Caroline‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for all that you are doing, I really appreciate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I may ask, If I live in a country where the kits don&rsquo;t ship to, can I use a mail forwarding service to order the kits to a US or Uk address for example and then to me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yay! Thank you from a teacher! It‚Äôs lovely to be recognised&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So frigging excited right now. I had a meeting booked for 10 tomorrow. Moved it. Am so ready for Kit 2. Got a spring one - very lucky. Going for another x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday Riley A+ gave me retinol burn, so i would to try Luna. Iso skin is killing me!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want both kits! Waking up very early over here üá®üá¶ to see if I can get something this time. I waited patiently last time and luck was not with me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bags look amazing! And Im obsessed with the inside camo design. As always thank you for these amazing kits! ü§ó</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahh I so wish I could afford one. I have not been working since March and spent all my few life savings to pay rent and such and I&rsquo;m broke as hell. But wonderful ‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing Caroline! Well done to you and your team ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for the mention Caroline. You have no idea how much it means. I&rsquo;ve been teaching for 30 years, but have never felt so misunderstood and unsupported. As most other teachers and many other professions , I worked willingly all through lockdown ( including Easter and half term), at the same time as providing online learning,  juggling looking out for my own kids at home and cooking and shopping for grandparents who were shielding. I will happily return to school again in September to help my pupils resume their schooling, but as with many other teachers, have lost my resilience and passion from the criticism that has been thrown at us.  It tears me apart to admit that the lack of support has driven me to consider leaving the job I once loved so much. Too many great teachers are now leaving because of this - so sad. Thank you for the mention and love!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok - for the guys at work and on a break, it&rsquo;s 14 minutes in approx,  to see what&rsquo;s actually,  in kits. You can always go back and watch the start, which is interesting, when home üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a skincare fanatic and a teacher - so this video made my day. Thank you Caroline!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don‚Äôt complain about the lighting , it‚Äôs making your skin look amazing xx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kit 2 starts at 29:00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi team, are both kits pregnancy &amp; breastfeeding friendly/safe? I know what you pick usually is but, just wanted to check ü§ûxxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great kits. Love some of the products in kit1, but I think I&rsquo;ll be going with kit 2. Fingers crossed I&rsquo;m lucky enough to bag one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow!! Keep up the great work Caroline xx

<p>Yaaaaas! Can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow.  Also just burnt my dinner because I was too engrossed in this video ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alarm set 4:30 a.m. in the US. Could never get on site to purchase gift 2. Just buffered endlessly. Not whining just stating my experience. And yes I signed up for newsletter!</p>

<p>Bless you Carolinaüíã These charities are wonderfulüíï</p>

<p>Wish I had one like you here in US</p>

<li>
<p>Yess. Can you also sell the bag separately?? X)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for all that you are doing with Beauty Backed and supporting the industry!</p>

<li>
<p>Amazing as always. Thank you for all of the hard work and for thinking of the teachers!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolutely amazing woman!! I hope each launch you do is bigger than the last. Thank you for recognising the teachers! Xx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done Caroline, I love the way you state your ethics.  You do such good work and I love the way you will tell a company you don&rsquo;t like the way they work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for supporting teachers. It can be so demoralising hearing constant negatives from everyone about your profession but to hear someone just say thank you we appreciate you makes the whole job worth it everytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg brilliant products, well done! ü•∞üëè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caroline at 40 mins in you said kit 1 but I think you might have meant kit 2 because you described it? Sorry if this is my mistake but just wanted to let you know x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anybody 3 mins 24 seconds from the end she meant kit 2 not kit 1! Kit one Ren cleanser, Kit two Kate‚Äôs goat milk! Xx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t afford the kits but these are amazing! Such great products xxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for all you are doing!  Any idea of about what the shipping  costs might be to the us?  Many thanks.</p>

<p>Really chuffed that the teachers are getting some love. As a member of the NHS and as a parent I salute them! Soooo excited about the products, the bag and that part of the money goes to great causes. All round winner in my book! Just hope all of beauty industry can get back to work tomorrow and then perfect day x</p>

<p>Hi you are so right about how you look on the Instagram uploads!!!!!  Tonight you look normal not like a big cheeked caricature XXX</p>

<p>Wow these kits are awesome! I&rsquo;d love to mix and match from the two.. sadly maternity pay won&rsquo;t stretch to a kit but if the bags ever go on sale I would looooove one. Well done Caroline and team for your awesome charity work and ethical stance on retail. X</p>
</li>

<p>They both look amazing but kit 1 with the Sunday Riley Luna wins for me! I&rsquo;ve never tried a skincare product where I saw a difference in the morning after use. Also thank you for gifting the press kits to teachers- will keep my fingers crossed! x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Countdown is on! Card at the ready!!</p>

<p>This is incredible ü§©ü§©ü§© Kit 2  is calling me</p>

<p>Had never tried Zelens before, but you rave about it, so I got small trials of the A, D and C. Of course, you were right - why do I even question anymore?? üßêüßêüßê</p>

<p>Thank you for donating your Pixi sales to Black Lives Matter and other social justice and equality causes, Caroline. Your solidarity, I know is so greatly appreciated!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caroline, your makeup is SO beautiful in your new book.  Could you please do a tutorial with the products you used?  I love your book so much I‚Äôve even given it as gifts.  These kits will be perfect accompaniments to the books!  ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>Who is Sunday Riley, which country is it from, I see it in Space NK ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow! Great kits and thank you CH!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like them, but can&rsquo;t afford them. Maybe put together kits on a budget? Holy grail products you can find at a pharmacy or drugstore?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we know if the SR Luna in kit 1 is the small or large size? Only because I am sharing with a friend and we are trying to calculate who will who what share of the bag&hellip; xxx</p>

<p>Hi Caroline I was wondering if you could do a vlog  focusing on products that are cruelty free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ù§Ô∏è so excited for tomorrow ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>Haven‚Äôt watched the whole video yet but how many of the products are cruelty free ? Or are they all cruelty free ? üòÄ</p>

<p>Waiting on a link to buy a kit for my girlfriend..absolute nightmare, no email..no link, no shop to just buy them from, infuriating and stressful trying to get these things</p>

<p>Yaaaaaayyyyyyy ü•≥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So happy you are using Dermalogica in the kits. My all time fav brand</p>

<p>can someone explain which one is for oily/combo and which is for dry? i didn&rsquo;t catch it in her explanation. thank you!</p>

<li>
<p>I have to say how grateful I am for all the work that Caroline and her team have put into not just getting these two amazing kits together. So happy on the other side of the world to being able to access so many products it‚Äôd still cost me a fortune to try even if I could get them all from one website!</p>
</li>

<p>Typically for me I‚Äôm going to miss the launch of this. I‚Äôm a shiftworker so that‚Äôs just my luck. I‚Äôm on a rare day shift tomorrow and will be in full ppe (icu Nurse) so won‚Äôt be able to access my phone.  as a positive though this will give me chance to save a little for the autumn kit.</p>
