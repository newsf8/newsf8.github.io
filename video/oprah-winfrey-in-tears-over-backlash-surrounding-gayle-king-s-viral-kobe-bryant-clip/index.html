<ul>
<li>
<p>You know who isnt doing well, VANESSA BRYANT and the kids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Oprah thinking about the tears Vanessa Bryant and his girls are crying or is it just Gayle that Oprah cares about&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah&rsquo;s school in Africa had students sexually assaulted, where&rsquo;s the same energy at though?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa hasn&rsquo;t slept either, neither have Michael Jackson&rsquo;s children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares if Gayle hasn&rsquo;t slept for two days?    Michael Jackson didn&rsquo;t sleep for years.   And Kobe is now sleeping forever.    Oprah - get over yourself and your unbelievable arrogance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa Bryant is not doing well. She lost a husband and a child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle and Oprah are done!  There’s no fixing this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah that’s how we cried when you interviewed those grown ass men who accused MJ of sexual abused AFTER he died and couldn’t defend himself!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle needs to be fired.  She has no talent anyway.  She got famous just because she&rsquo;s Oprahs bed buddy. Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa’s family isn’t doing well. Nor are the 7 families who lost their loved ones in this tragic accident. Gayle got what she deserved. Please have the same energy and ask Harvey Weinstein these questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle’s interviewing style is just horrible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am sick of Oprah and Gayle. They play victims when they victimize our community. Bye Felicia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why should anyone care how Gayle is doing? How is Kobe&rsquo;s family and friends? Kobe&rsquo;s name and legacy has been dragged through the mud since the day he died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle, said she was mortified by the clip CBS posted. However, she wasn’t mortified</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when she was asking those questions of Lisa Leslie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle isn’t sleeping - Kobe and GG will never wake up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle and Oprah are the 2 biggest Aunty Toms ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel sorry for Kobe&rsquo;s daughters, especially the oldest one. Image waking up one day and watching the interview, I would have been pissed. Gayle didn&rsquo;t have to ask the question it was up to her. The man hasn&rsquo;t been buried yet damn it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has Nothing to do with Race! But Respect! Why when discussing Kobe&rsquo;s Legacy, would Gayle even bring up charges that were dismissed!! Shameful&hellip;

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah is such a phony&hellip;.and can’t stand not being the center of attention&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see any compassion in Gayle&rsquo;s interview. She was being forceful and mean spirited. She was trying to appease mainstream media and it backfired. Take the L and eat crow Gayle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s not doing well? How bout some sympathy for Kobe&rsquo;s wife! Your stupid friend should&rsquo;ve never went there. All for rating$. Trust me Gail is very happy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bloody snake Oprah is feeling sad for Gayle just like she was feeling for her bff Harvey Weinstein</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah is one of the most dangerous black women still alive&hellip;.She’s a great actor and she’s still hurting from her past&hellip;.She knows nothing that’s going on around her&hellip;she loves every train that goes into “ Blast Men City”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This proves that women aren’t held accountable for their actions. Gayle asked a inappropriate question at the wrong time and somehow she flipped the narrative and now we’re sympathizing for Gayle. Smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest she thought Lisa was going to be on her side because she&rsquo;s a woman and kudos to Lisa for not taking the bait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah sold out to the devil long ago!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Them tears came and went in a moment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah and gayle hate black men period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somebody need to interview Oprah an ask her why she hasn&rsquo;t spoken out about H.W🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emmitt Till&rsquo;s murder is out free, &amp; bragging about his murder, &amp; this bulldagger hasn&rsquo;t said one word!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah, maybe you and Gayle need to stop singling out black men to cover for your friends like Harvey Weinstein. #JustMaybe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever, she shouldn’t had spoke on that period‼️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she shouldn&rsquo;t be doing well, but it was you Oprah that coached her to take down black men. If it was dismissed why are you bringing it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if they showed the full interview it wouldve still got the same reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah now knows how Michael Jackson&rsquo;s fans and family feel when she bashed him on her TV show though he was declared innocent.  The Bible says we reap what we sow and vengeance is mines says the Lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry Oprah you can’t save your friend Gayle this time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle added more insult to injury when she didn&rsquo;t accept the fact that she disrespected to the late Legend, Kobe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got no sympathy for Gayle.  She knew what she was doing when she asked those questions.

<li>
<p>&ldquo;Get you a bestie like Oprah&rdquo; Miss me with the use of black lingo while sympathizing for this rich trash bag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t care that Bill was texting from jail😂. She was trying to take some attention away from the situation by telling on Bill. She is a real piece of work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cry for Venessa Bryant!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Gayle and Oprah lack empathy, that’s obvious; but then to do an interview about him when he’s unable to defend himself is beyond appalling. It’s a low down dirty shame!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle and Oprah are Partners if you know what I mean. They&rsquo;re so far in the Closet they&rsquo;re in Narnia!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe has 3 daughter&rsquo;s and a loving wife he left behind, and now they have to deal with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It wasn’t the clip that was the problem&hellip;. it was the fact that she really thought that was okay to ask in the time of his passing &hellip;. you literally had over 10 YEARS to ask him that question.  Instead of using ur Network as an excuse just simply APOLOGIZE and own up that you were wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobie&rsquo;s wife hasn&rsquo;t slept either . Gayle, YOU CANCELLED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares if she haven&rsquo;t slept in two, days who cares what about his wife in kids they haven&rsquo;t slept in weeks ???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Lisa Leslie deserves a nod for class and decorum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way I rolled my eyes - I’ve lost all my respect for Oprah</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gail and oprah are an embarrassment to the black community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s not doing well? She wasn’t thinking about how Vanessa was doing or her children when the Kobe questions were coming out her mouth. R.I.P Kobe and Gianna 🙏🏼❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t Gayle discussed her co-worker and friend Charlie Rose? Why not discuss her friends Les Moonves or Harvey Weinstein? Where&rsquo;s her interview about Roger Ailes after he died?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She deserves it.  Kobe went through all that already. He proved to be a great man and a legend that continues to inspire people to this day. No need to reopen the wound when his friends and family are still dealing with his loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares about any of this? Wow&hellip; Rich people problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3D - Disappointing, Disgusting, Disgraceful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;She not doing well&rdquo; How you think Kobe wife and childern are doing&hellip;There was no respect for a grieving family who lost two of their love ones who haven&rsquo;t been even buried yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;2 DAYS&rdquo;&hellip;..???? I&rsquo;m sure VANESSA  BRYANT haven&rsquo;t SLEPT in TWO WEEKS&hellip;.Damn Her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart goes out to the people families&hellip;why did GK not interview their friends?  Looking forward to it and if she does ask them negative   question.  Waiting!

<li>
<p>I just love how every Oprah video nowadays has mostly dislikes. Karma really does exist!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harpo doesn&rsquo;t represent Black People so who was she pleading too?.. and How about how Mrs Bryant&rsquo;s tears?.. not One mention of that. Where&rsquo;s her Harvey Weinstein interview?. Boycott Gayle and Harpo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah &amp; Gayle lying through their teeth. We ain’t buying it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares if Gayle hasn&rsquo;t slept for two days?    Michael Jackson didn&rsquo;t sleep for years.   And Kobe is now sleeping forever.    Oprah - get over yourself and your unbelievable arrogance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sale out!!! Smh heartless!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BooHoo,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pound Me Too has backfired in her face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cry me a river.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t care that she’s not doing well .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s the last thing I want to worry about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the most disrespectful question to ask !!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His legacy should not be complicated because he will and always be a legend!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Vanessa&rdquo; is not doing well!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That weave or wig on Gail&rsquo;s head has to go, with all that money, your hair still looking like a lion mane.lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmaooooo Oprah trying soooo hard to squeeze out a tear 😂😂😂 you have to have a soul to cry Oprah!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know Gayle King only got as far as she did because she rode on Oprah’s  back, never thought she had any chance of being on GMA &hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mo&rsquo;Nique is doing the &ldquo;told ya so&rdquo; dance somewhere my beloveds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“She’s not doing well.” Imagine how Kobe’s family feels. There were literally eight other people on the helicopter who died. Including his own daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle could have shown some compassion to the Bryant family before she started digging for skeletons..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She trying to excuse and blame the network but she knew that question would be aired thats the one thing that shouldn&rsquo;t have been even brought about&hellip;and when lisa answered the question she reinerated that the witness did not testify&hellip;.which made lisa go further into defending him!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah’s fake tears! Haha! Gayle the one that started it. Now she’s acting like the victim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When she tried to bully Leslie into making a bad statement about Kobe. I don’t get people sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah works for the devil!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle had no problem sleeping the day after the interview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love seeing Oprah having her friend&rsquo;s back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah promoted John of God who said he faith healed but rain a baby farm for pervert elites in South America. How dare she .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is Oprah acting again, like she is in &ldquo;The Color Purple!&rdquo; &ldquo;I had to fight all my life for Gayle!&rdquo; 😭😭😭 (PLEEEZE)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She and Gayle  continue to denigrate the &ldquo;black male&rdquo; always the aggressor, thug etc.  Continuing on with the white folks mentality that we are lesser beings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now the questions she asked is part of her legacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know who else is not doing well? Kobe Bryant&rsquo;s widow and children 😢😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So where is Oprah&rsquo;s expose on Harvey or the Playboy Mansion?!? The mansion held some of the dirtiest secrets in Hollywood. Nope, Gayle and O only go after a certain market, I see..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill crazy ass tweeting from the joint😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah, sitting there explaining to 2 white girls. Why isn&rsquo;t she talking to black women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a question to ask King - how does Oprah taste?</p>
</li>

<p>Monique is somewhere laughing 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah and her girl Gayle has a well documennted history of digging up dirt on BLACK men for whatever reason is considered a sabotage on the black male image and masculinity. Michael Jackson, R. Kelly, Kobe Bryant just to name a few. WhatEVER is their motivation for doing this as a black man myself is beyond me. I am beginning to WONDER is they motivated by the white control media for ratings ? or are they BOTH so miserable with their OWN lives, after all it is OBVIOUS no black man WANTS them , if so Im SURE they can use the power of their wealth to BUY themselves a man. I&rsquo;m SURE there are a lot of WHITE men they can find to talk negitive about in the entrainment world, but they are SMART enough NOT to cross THAT line, because of all the big time WHITE owned TV executive&rsquo;s that has POWER or control to ship BOTH of their Black men bashing asses completely off the airwaves PERMANENTLY.( YES , i KNOW Oprah is a billionaire), but the REAL power to control black network and all OTHER runs through the WHITE WEALTHY ELITE, Oprah happen to just have a seat on the front ROW with her money. These are SADLY two of the WORST at dishing and digging up dirt on the FAMOUS black men in America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opra wouldnt see the harm that gayle caused.she just wouldnt see it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Oprah, you as her friend you wouldn&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo; 😂🤣😂🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect the family !!! 1, 5, 10, 50 years later, this should have never EVER been brought up !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She don’t expect that backlash I hope Vanessa Bryant sue her!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤬Gayle was INAPPROPRIATE, OUT OF LINE, &amp; OUT OF ORDER!</p>
</li>

<p>👍Lisa HANDLED THE SITUATION WITH CLASS, DIGNITY &amp; RESPECT! 💝</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second 49 when Lisa looked her up and down like r u kidding me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Gayle wasn&rsquo;t Oprah&rsquo;s GIRL FRIEND she wouldn&rsquo;t be where she is in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ll tell you who hasn’t slept in days&hellip;Kobe’s wife! 😭💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah, in her no- tear streak makeup, makes Cosby sound like he was guilty and not part of a conspiracy to take down successful black men.   She&rsquo;s a sellout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the dumbest that I&rsquo;ve ever heard Oprah lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should have said &quot; It was a perfect talk&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When is Gayle King going to apologize for bringing up that situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hahaha “she hasn’t slept in two days”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hoda, fr: Hoda and Jenna Today&rsquo;s Show, HAD more  emotions mtg Oprah than Oprah had for defending her BFF, Gayle King. Oprah did NOT shed one tear&hellip; 🙄 Oh, did you notice, the media/network, #NBC showed a clip of OW defending GK to push the narrative/promote, Hoda/Jenna Today Show (Crickets)&hellip; Both Oprah and Gayle are throwing the media/network, #CBS (GK employeR where OW got her a J O B) under the bus&hellip; now, GK refused to go to work and has to walk around w/security&hellip; 🤭 Uh&hellip; you don&rsquo;t get pd $11M and not expect to get your KNEES dirty! 😉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We love y’all Oprah and Gayle keep attacking black Community ✊🏻🇺🇸</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bryant family is not doing WELL!</p>

<p>What about accountability, condolences, a sincere apology?  The blame is not on the network, because the question should of never been asked.  Where is her moral and ethical compass, on zero?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah and Gayle having their &ldquo;aha moments.&rdquo;  To bring this up and for Oprah to come to her defense has revealed them for what they are.  Gayle is a liar.  She new what she was asking in that interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time someone do a documentary on Oprah and Gayle, let&rsquo;s see what skeletons come tumbling out their closets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I might think twice about this if I hadn&rsquo;t seen the interview with R. Kelly.  I was disgusted when I witnessed that interview.  Disgusted with the lack of neutrality.  Clearly she didn&rsquo;t believe nor like R. Kelly but as a reporter, your feelings are irrelevant, you must stay neutral.  In this particular case, I don&rsquo;t think the question should&rsquo;ve come up at all.  I&rsquo;m not into bashing my brothers and sisters because I understand the divide and conquer game. I think we should be assertive and correct our brothers and sisters in an effort to keep us grounded in love but I don&rsquo;t think hateful abusive rhetoric is going to resolve anything.  These are some horrific times we&rsquo;re living in.  We have to figure out how to love even if it has to be a distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aght aggggghhht! Don’t start that crying now 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah you did the same thing to Michael Jackson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release the whole interview!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah really! You too..Omg Oprah you are breaking my Heart. I wanted you to run for President someday. Well if you someday do run. I don&rsquo;t know if I will still vote for you. Ill prey for you Oprah. Love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear what Tommy Sotomayor has to say about this! 👍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting death threats for just bringing up Kobes rape case hmmm 🤔 I wonder why his accuser dropped the charges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has any one asked how the Bryant family is doing how many sleepless nights they have had along with the other families 🤷🏽‍♀️Oprah is digging her OWN grave .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WE ARE AT THE END OF THE SYSTEM OF THINGS AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED! DARKNESS HAS ATTACKED US ALL ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE LOVED THE BEST! WE NEED TO BE MORE DISCRIMINATING!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I looooove fake tears! Good job Oprah!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In January 23, 2017&hellip; Madonna said on National Television that she was Angry and Outraged and thought about blowing up the White House&hellip;. Remember ?  Where you at Susan Rice ??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;d do well leaving your friendship, O.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why didn’t they ask Oprah about Harvey Weinstein?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so upset about Gayle bringing this up after the case was dismissed. Kobe and all on plane are dead. let him rest in peace. every man on planet are not rapidity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never disrespect the Deceased &ldquo;Period&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s family, fans are not doing so well either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re actor&rsquo;s they know how to cry if you know what I mean.🐰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah&rsquo;s just FRIED HER LEGACY!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle did that to herself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry she needs to &ldquo;not do well&rdquo;.  Such a dishonor to the family, shame on her and also to those who decided to air the interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watch the full interview. And to tell you the truth when that question came up, I said in my mind why at this time is she asking this particular question. It didn&rsquo;t make sense to me that question could have waited. It wasn&rsquo;t even necessary. So, I&rsquo;m sorry Gail you were wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle should interview Dwyane Wade next 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Galye hock and spit on Kobe before he even got buried. SMH! Because she&rsquo;s as worst as Oprah</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She talking about Vanessa Bryant or Gayle King? Who&rsquo;s not doing well, Oprah? Foh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video makes me smile. The way they did Michael Jackson I&rsquo;m surprised all y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t need security. Get em Bill!!! Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, Gayle brought it upon herself. I hope she finds the clicks worth her total disrespect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MJ KIDS ARE NOT DOING WELL DID YOU CARE OPRAH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I find it funny how everyone wanna pretend that kobe Bryant was such a saint and dismiss all his demons cause he is dead now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cry for Vanessa Bryant&hellip;.. She probably has not slept since she lost  her husband and daughter&hellip;. Use your common sense and heart. Opps,you don&rsquo;t have one&hellip; STHU Gayle, you&rsquo;re dismissed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to see the whole interview to see that was petty effed up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the phone bs! She meant in the bed with her!</p>

<p>Gayle the questions to ask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its sad that &lsquo;your&rdquo; so called  network played YOU out👀👀👀👀..they didn&rsquo;t even give YOU the respect to be apart of the editing🤦😮😮why??🙅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares if Gayle is not doing well. Vanessa is doing bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Old witch Ofra Winfrey!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boohoo people are mad at us!! I&rsquo;m going to cry into my never-ending wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then she snitched on Bill Cosby lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dont feel good when the finger pointed on you lets make a oprah and gayle secret lovers documentary see how they like their lives being interrogated and judged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prayers and healing  to The Jackson family for the  pain and tears that Oprah Winfrey caused you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah-May I say she isn&rsquo;t doing well??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me- No you may not Ms. Oprah 🙄 I&rsquo;ll tell you who isn&rsquo;t doing well Vanessa Bryant and her daughters, Kobe&rsquo;s Mother &amp; Father</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah I need your help. I can help with your place in Hawaii. All I need in a cozy cabin. I know we go way back. One of your old 4 door sedans will be fine. Im in SC. Love you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw the interview and I was disappointed the way it was presented was very poor, trying portray a victum will not fly .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was no context missing though. She was literally being condescending and at one point even said &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t see it you&rsquo;re his friend&rdquo;. They actually left that part out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe&rsquo;s family is not doing well f*** Gail 😎</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess we will never know the real reason about the case drop 🤔. There&rsquo;s always a first time yet people should not take money. No one knows a person behind close doors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just OWN IT Yoda!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah crying for Male king, word on the street is SNOOP COMING FOR BOTH Y&rsquo;ALL OPRAH, ALLEGLY!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one forced G king to say those things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah is doing damage control G king is only losing sleep because the tape hot out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHE HASN&rsquo;T SLEEP IN TWO DAYS&hellip; REALLY&hellip; AND KOBE FAMILY WHAT? HAVE YOU THINK HOW MANY DAYS THEY HAVEN&rsquo;T SLEEP SINCE KOBE🌹 AND GIANNA🌹 GONE 🤦‍♀️ (RESPECT HE&rsquo;S FAMILY) WE LOVE YOU KOBE 🏀 NO MATTER WHAT 💝

<p>Give me a break. Gayle, you knew exactly what you were doing&hellip;precisely what you doing. I don&rsquo;t care that your network showed you asking a particular question, you really shouldn&rsquo;t have asked that particular question. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get whoever&rsquo;s &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; fired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle you have plenty of time to get Kobe&rsquo;s and take on the entire situation if you wanted to know that bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idc if the interview was an hour long &hellip;. it should not have been brought up PERIOD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah doing her immediate damage control. Regular protocol that&rsquo;s all 🤣🤣🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When someone dies especially Black they find something from the past to dig up all the time &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah&rsquo;s a mess. She name dropped Bill Cosby Tweeting from jail, which is not a crime. Here&rsquo;s part of his Tweet, &ldquo;My heartfelt prayers are with Kobe and his family, as well as with Michael Jackson and his family. May their legacies live on forever.&rdquo; Oprah is very arrogant and i honestly haven&rsquo;t supported her in years. After I heard her in an interview saying, &quot; When I act, the god Set comes into me&rdquo; I was done. He&rsquo;s the god of chaos and violence aka Satan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U spoke it was your words and cbs ain’t got your tung u are to blame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah just taking up for her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, her acting skills is impressive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle, if “no means no” when a woman says it, then WHY did you keep verbally harassing Lisa Leslie after she said “NO”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also remember oprah&rsquo;s interview with Jennifer Aniston when brad divorced her. It was not also nice! It was done againt Angelina Jolie and absolutely unfair. Private life is somthing that doesn&rsquo;t need much discussion especially when the both sides Brad and Angelina made the statement about their private lives at that time. It looked like taking revenge by Aniston to talk about already the previous relationship, it was not cool ar all !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah you have dominated the media your whole life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re complaining about the media?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Gail sleepless? AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT KOBE&rsquo;S WIFE AND CHILDREN?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA and they shall eat their own!!! You helped create the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Girl Bye 👋 welcome to the Real World Harpo 🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such fake tears&hellip; Oprah is full of it herself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somebody at the Network new exactly what they were doing when they broadcast those 90 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gump does Cosby tweeting from jail have to do with any of this??? Someone please try an explain 😂.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the best croockodile tears, the Oscar goes to &hellip;&hellip;. Oprahhhhh!

<p>Oprah put her on the map. She was Oprah&rsquo;s favorite thing. Maybe Oprah needs to bring Gayle back the the obscurity she pulled her from. Then she should follow her there. All that crying stuff is all so women can rally to her side. And maybe some will. But this ain&rsquo;t no &ldquo;me too&rdquo; thing. This is a being a scumbag thing. And I think people are fed up with their BS. Oprah and gayle are buddy buddy with Harvey Weinstein. Oprah&rsquo;s spiritual guy is in prison for some sexual charge. Why don&rsquo;t she do a documentary about people in her own circle?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exactly, ”it&rsquo;s the other people who take these types of interviews and act out on them”  as a educated woman of color with a black son( Ms King) &hellip; You should understand the importance of opening the door to that next level of fools&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certainly journalistic Integrity has its place, but where is your respect for his family or your responsibility to your community???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont belive Gayles excuse Operas tears or that the network took anything out of context. Cbs did what they do to anyone they interview not set up Gayle. So there are no apologies needed from Cbs. Please stop it! How much sypathy did Steve Harvey receive reading from a teleprompter what the network asked him to say?  Oprahs attack on black men has brought attacks on innocent black men by others. Her feelings of entitlement to attack men  consistently over allegations rather than evidence has brought these things to fruition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They r sell out long time so it just coming to show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misogyny&hellip;Bwahahahaha?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess it’s just toxic masculinity. JFC, grow up&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle King and Oprah Winfrey are the most sell out black journalist in history why the hell you going to ask about Kobe rape charge didn&rsquo;t have nothing to do with his death😠🤬😡that happen years and decades ago&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guess what Kobe&rsquo;s family is not doing well either..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many INTELLIGENT black folks!!!!! Makes me feel GOOD!!!!!    👍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harvey Swinestein?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y&rsquo;all female love that self victimization. that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gayle&rsquo;s fault, she has nobody to blame for that dumb stuff she was doin there! I am glad Lisa didn&rsquo;t fall for the B.S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no puedo traducir los videos a español para poder entenderlos, y los subtitulos tampoco estan en español.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oprah is guilty of similar. With Monique, and MJ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s her job to all those questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get you a bestie like Oprah💀😂 WHO WROTE THAT FOR HER?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, spare us the sob stories, Oprah, cause we don&rsquo;t want to hear it.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Your bestie sabotaged Kobe&rsquo;s legacy the same way YOU sabotaged Michael Jackson&rsquo;s legacy&hellip;.but kept quiet in regards to Harvey Weinstein.   So, both of y&rsquo;all are just pathetic

<p>Oh well! Cry for attention and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be some type of mandate in place that says whenever you talk about Oprah and reference Gayle you must address Gayle as &ldquo;Oprah&rsquo;s Best Friend.&rdquo;  For the last 20+ years it is always stated that Gayle is Oprah&rsquo;s best friend.  Isn&rsquo;t that something you do when you are kid?  So and so is my Best Friend.  We get it.  The world wouldn&rsquo;t know who Gayle if it wasn&rsquo;t for Oprah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was a bad performance on Oprah’s part&hellip;.and Gayle’s apology?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched the whole interview and there’s no way to “spin” that interview!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lisa didn’t appear “fine”&hellip;she was clearly upset. But, Lisa handled herself extremely well!</p>

<p>I’m female (white) and I’m appalled!</p>
