<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of the figures(from America too) resemble the Aboriginal Wonjinas in Australia .Could the petroglyph of the squares with dots inside be a map of the valley below showing how the settlement was back then?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like a desk at a field construction site. It has a perpetual calendar of sorts (90 day quarters) and a 3d map of the valley below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Hunting scene&rdquo; Not quite. The guy with the golf club is p-oed, because he just missed the put.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes! Also Mexico, South Africa, Australia, Middle Near East! Our home is the Stars!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like Happy Gilmore, chasing the guy who stole his pants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinda sad but I like all the time you have to make all these videos for us, a Huge thanks and keep up the good work :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:22 that&rsquo;s Orion as depicted of 4 main dots in the outer and 3 dots in the inner frame to Sirius</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>03:37. guy&rsquo;s dancing, playing a musical instrument, the triangle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@3:00 - those petroglyphs look like it is definitely a map.  There are petroglyphs of houses with thatched roofs at the base of it, which makes it seem even more likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That map cut into the rock of the valley view is remarkable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I instantly thought of Urfa Man as well when I saw that &ldquo;V neck collar&rdquo; on that drawing&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:13 helmets,bent knees,pointed toes, and arms stretched? Could it be obvious that they are in the air holding strange artifacts? That&rsquo;s interesting. Also pointing out how there are no wings to depict them flying but you have to wonder if this is what they actually truly looked like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The squares with the round divots remind me of that site in Central or South America with the long line of divots or holes across the mountain. Thanks for the videoüòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:16 these triangles they are holding, are these proto man-bags shown by the Sumerians etc.? Most likely they were depicting plasma structures they&rsquo;ve seen in the skies at the time, forget UFOs&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hope your brother has got his fly up when he&rsquo;s throwing clubs.üòÇ thanks for the video, btw. Fascinating as always.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just read of a &ldquo;Grid like structure&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Ufo) seen in the sky!?! I think it was on Leak proj.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urfa man.. looks like that familiar bag in his hand! Would love to know what that represents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANKS C.Füëçüá≠üá≤

<li>
<p>The three stick figures have triangular legs and almost mirror the great pyramids ü§î.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the figures at 4:45 or thereabouts were  social distancing. Arms stretched out to about 6 feet. üòé Really enjoying the videos lately, thanks for the hard work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one on the left of thumbnail is a window washer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one with the &ldquo;golf club&rdquo; is clearly holding a bag with handle. Like in Sumerian  depictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The golfer is holding a bag the same size and the ones you see in Egypt. What‚Äôs in their hands?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe there was contact with aliens or beings from another dimension. Also probably some influence of hallucinogens. I know many people rule out these ideas but it&rsquo;s just my opinion. Great video, thanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The figures with lines xoming from the head look like Star People drawings from American Indians. Ha!! You said the same at the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:19 I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s a landscape drawing. We could be looking at the world&rsquo;s oldest landscape painting .</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>if you count the &lsquo;boxes&rsquo; from top to bottom&hellip; it&rsquo;s about 7.  If you look at the landscape from top to bottom  it&rsquo;s about just more than seven fields.   Counting left to right the scale is a close match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The man with the radiating crown opposite the female reminds me of Sogmatar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plot twist- these are kids drawings &amp; homework assignments.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;something hanging beneath the belt there&rdquo;&hellip; uhm, maybe we need to have the talk, chuck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from up there where the petroglyphs are,  some are tons that they could see on the valley  down below</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very cool Chuck, thanks! You&rsquo;ve probably already done a vid on &lsquo;Blythe Intaglios: The Impressive Anthropomorphic Geoglyphs of the Colorado Desert&rsquo;, huh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretty awesome. Especially at 5:06 it seems to depict a village.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people w halos are clearly a man &amp; a woman. What happens when they overlap those triangles&hellip;? What figure(s) does it create&hellip;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:50 &hellip;..thats gotta be Chuck one hoppin a par 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This, just now, makes me wish I had a giant picture book of all know petroglyphs from all over the planet.

<p>Some of those are very intriguing, i would simply go with the easiest guess, &ldquo;they&rdquo; were already here.üõ∏ i immediately thought about the Urfa man when you showed the V-collar depiction, obviously you&rsquo;re a very brilliant man Chuck.üôÑ I know some people think you see Orion everywhere and i have to agree with them, ironically for them i also think your assumptions are correct. Anyway, it was quite interesting to see some rock art from this part of the world. What&rsquo;s less interesting is to wake up a 5 am to go work tommorow&hellip;at least things are getting back to normal up here in QC. Thanks a lot Chuck, like always, it is much appreciated.üëä</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haha. I thought about the guy throwing a golf club! üòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:00 looks like a shaman dancing great stuff!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At minute 4.45, the figures are walking on a world map, I can see Florida on the right, Iceland and Greenland and Ireland, etc. in those squiggly lines beneath the feet of the figures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those haloed petroglyphs kinds remind me of the haloed relief carving at sogmatar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The similarities to others elsewhere, are stunning. I think the Europeans travelled all over the world in ancient times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thx Chuck, great job. What you&rsquo;re leaving behind is so important. Cheers!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You read my mind when you said partying like 1999 cuz that&rsquo;s totally what I gotfrom these petroglyphs maybe Prince had something to do with this&hellip; but I doubt it.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Jk, there&rsquo;s always seriously good videos appreciate the hell out of you ü§òüñ§üòÅüëçüïâÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ancient man&rsquo;s attempt to record what he saw that&rsquo;s what he saw it looks extraterrestrial to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the inspiration. I have done a follow up to your, Ancient Equator vid, from the, 24 May, 2014. Global knub network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the animals similar to those found in Wadi Hammamat Egypt.  Another great vid. Thanks for sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, very interesting. Those three with the round thing on the top, look like the usa moon landing with a flag. I love those figures with something around their head, and the way you dont say anything that you think, but ask us. Brilliant! Also amazing that they still exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depictions of humans in different states of excitement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gee I would be interested to know what period they claim the figure riding something (a horse ?) is from ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who has any idea about these sites? Thank You for the work You do for us!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My thought is that those ancient alien guys never skipped leg day at the gym and had some great calves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very interesting subject Chuck : thanks for sharing your research about these petroglyphs. The region in which they are located is indeed beautiful, thoughout all seasons. I had the chance to explore it on many different occasions, and I must admit that it is one of the nicest parts of the Alps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmao the golf clubs tho üèåÔ∏èüòÇüèåÔ∏è

<li>
<p>Great reporting and Thank you. I am new to this and far from a scholar. What I see is a depiction of worship of the sun, possible mapping of an area, and beings/people that look like they are wearing a helmet or some round head-dress. I have subscribed to your channel and look forward to updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@4:48 r those beings walking into a StarGate of some kind??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just as we write today. What we observe and what it means to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two figures with the rounded &lsquo;&lsquo;head&rdquo; looks similar to what is interpreted to be a sun - circle with rays. Maybe people coming from the &lsquo;sun&rsquo;? They seem to be holding some triangle, some sort of a device. Maybe this was a &lsquo;map&rsquo; created for the &lsquo;people from the sun&rsquo; (faraway galaxies)&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know how when people are tripping they see unusual &lsquo;Beings&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üò≥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§î</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the tall figures, aliens with rays from their heads, lightning brothers from australia is when 28 plasma currents called birkeland currents are visible then this kind of morphs into a toroidal field, a donut like they say, thats the head or the horns, the circle which then goes into 56 currents.. so plasmastream creates electrical field creates magnetic field, these magnetic fields have the shape of a donut (look up ferrocell magnetic field) and pinches the plasmastream of &ldquo;charged particles&rdquo;.. they were seen from different angles in many varying state&rsquo;s of the process, when the Peratt instability is fully formed it would have been very dangerous to look at it, lots of radiation, to be specific synchrotron radiation, deadly for sure. this is rarely depicted in petroglyphs and are 9 toroidal fields stacked on top of each other with a central plasma stream and &ldquo;horns&rdquo; on top as seen in a few examples from around the world.. just read the paper its free at</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 3:19 the figures look remarkably like those at 5:41. The difference is what they&rsquo;re holding in their hands, hmmm&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can change the subtitles to English in the Italian video and understand most or some of what they&rsquo;re saying. The translation is not that good. I saw the entire video. Never does it mention sci-fi, ancient astronauts, ancient outlandish technology so prevalent in american videos. Italians try to keep that nonsense out. The video mentions that the strange characters depicted are part of a &ldquo;mythology&rdquo;. That makes sense. We all show monsters in our art, drawings, movies, it does not mean we actually saw them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a beautiful valley Chuck - thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very cool indeed! I have seen some of those glyphs before but I did not realize their source was Northern Italy! Interesting! Oh, and those at 3:20&hellip; clearly it&rsquo;s a representation of a 60&rsquo;s beauty parlor&rsquo;s hair dryers&hellip; Thanks, man. You rock!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love your dry humor, a lot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also can be some adolescent making art.  Abstract and no deeper meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched &lsquo;Unusual Anomalies &amp; Discoveries&rsquo; - about the nasa moon photography smudge over. It covered historical fotos of Mars also. Tying in with these amazing rock carvings&hellip; really makes us question <em>what the heck did people see in our past</em>? .. Are we just a straggly tail end of great civilisations?? &hellip; We certainly should be in better condition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emanations are white/ light/ golden. Sun, hair, antlers. Apparently they were depicting the fair haired giants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re finding similarities between petroglyphs and building/engineering technics all over the world, from a time in history when world travel was supposed to be an impossibility (or at least we think no-one was travelling around the world back in those times).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent report, you are working hard, I hope you get even more subscribers!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those look like settlement maps and the &ldquo;golf club&rdquo; guy  looks a shaman or chief. Fancy &ldquo;v&rdquo; thing and depicted with a &ldquo;staff&rdquo; like baton.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your brother to put on pants next time he golfs. Lol

<p>The one at 3:41&hellip;looks like the rod and ring. It appears circles where hard to carve in that rock. And he definitely was trying to kill the halo or enlightened figure below.  Awesome place! Thank you for sharing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Chuck.   lol your brother golfing  :-)</p>
</li>

<p>Some of those just scream &ldquo;maps&rdquo; to me. But if they are, that means whoever made them had a pretty good grasp of visualising things from a different perspective, and it indicates a relatively advanced society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dots in the square</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be animals they have in a pen</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Which would be valuable enough in their life for them to represent in art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The triangles. Crossbows?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would appear that the drawing shows a human egg surrounded by 32 sperm and On right 2 fallopian tubes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tentacles / lines emanating from the head is long matted [like dreadlocks] hair &hellip; in the petroglyphs where it looks like the figure has a helmet is long hair that is woven into a specific style representing a particular [now long deceased] clan !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Petroglyphs predate the comb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I recommend Andy Hall&rsquo;s presentations at the Thunderbolts Project. He covers the plasma cosmology origin of the chevron thoroughly. It&rsquo;s been sculpted into the planet on every continent. That was some wicked shit kicking that caused the geomorphology. We&rsquo;re due for another. Ice ages are cyclical. @4:05 I count 17 on the left 15 on the right. Never seen that before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cool stuff. Were those corona-virus heads?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar depictions in Australia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great video! These were new to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guy with the stick could be Dagda. Maybe just another name for Orion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The man with the golf club has a handbag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thunderbolts Project&hellip;. THUNDERBOLTS PROJECT!!!!!!! Anthony Peratt, Dwardu Cardona&hellip;&hellip;. they‚Äôre not a mystery, we have figured out already what these mean!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either depicting ceremonial garb- or, aliens..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The figure you call the sun, I think, is more than that.  Perhaps that&rsquo;s a depiction of a solar eclipse with the corona.  That being said, the figures with outstretched arms could likely represent panicking people.

<p>The not &lsquo;Alien&rsquo; figures - are they holding crossbows ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some older figures will have been catholisised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice .Really cool stuff.. Keep up the great work.üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funny and interesting   üíù</p>
</li>

<p>05:41. Are the two helmeted &ldquo;space&rdquo; figures holding triangles, fighting with barbaric mini-crossbows, just for kicks?  Or, triangles symbolize a lot of diff stuff to humans, just google triangle meaning. Could have meant almost anything to the figures if they were just gesturing at each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve already covered this?</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see coordinated effort to see the similarity, globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of then look Hopi and other native American style</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The little indentations or peak marks look like material removal from Sardinia. Also Australian aboriginals used peak marks then joined them together with a deep groove</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>definitely fascinating pictures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That V neck comment was cool. You have a very nice day&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A man holding a cross of Jesus and a man with a bow. Both with hallows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hunter carries a bag or bucket in his left hand, much like Shamash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bless you all</p>

<p>I reserve judgement on the meaning until Alex Jones has spoken on the subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many times i&rsquo;ve said to myself &quot; that stuff looks like imagery  when I was tripping on acid. If you have ever taken an hallucinogenic ( LSD, peyote, etc), ,many of the shapes and forms make sense and may explain why they are so similar all over the world. That would be a video I would make. Research drawings and images made by subjects tripping on LSD, there are many in research records. Egypt had a secret religious sect central to their government that relied on psychotropic substances like the Nile Lilly etc. Mind altering was a large part of early human cosmology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the deer/moose animal Petroglyph has 13 horns on each side that branch off of the two main horns.  They were luciferian, so this number was significant to their luciferian religion.  It also shows that they were advanced enough to have a number system and could count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The halo/auro dog people/chemeleon vampires. Cain. Cannibals.  Cenocephali. Baal/Baphomet/Orion/Nimrod left path world. Wardens. Nazi werewolves. Werewolves of London. Scripture mentions they eat humans like bread. Thank you for your work. Seeking/researching OT peace/blessings</p>
