<ul>
<li>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not white and try to run for the presidency, you&rsquo;re not a natural-born citizen? 🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bunkerboy McLie just can&rsquo;t help himself. Like tourettes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I question if Trump is actually American. Look how orange he looks, he must be from Mars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A natural born citizen is anyone who was born in the united states, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. By Trump&rsquo;s definition, he shouldn&rsquo;t have been president because his mom was an immigrant from Scotland. What a buffoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one is impressed or surprised of this b.s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jared is the weakest sycophant  of all in Trumps failed administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Trump still hasn&rsquo;t shown his taxes 🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strange he mentions about not meeting requirements when he&rsquo;s appointed several people who didn&rsquo;t meet requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so as his first lady Melania Trump as she is born in Slovenia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to see PROOF that Trump was born on this planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kamala should charge Trump with slander.  Lying to the public about her,  spreading vicious gossip,  trying to ruin her career,  and that&rsquo;s just a start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not believe Trump was born int he US. He must be from the planet &ldquo;liar.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good old birth certificate talk all over again…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typical trump, throwing dirt in the water to blur the view. The US Constitution (which trump obviously has never read) states that ANY PERSON born in US is a Natural Born American Citizen, no matter the nationality of their parents. Trump and his GOP lackies will push the lie, just like they did with Obama, to feed their racist base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone who&rsquo;s not originally from Europe aren&rsquo;t Americans apparently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy will never stop lying, insulting and creates chaos until he is dead !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But but, we still haven’t seen Trumps Taxes so&hellip;he should shut the eff up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know Trump is losing support when even FOX news defends Kamala.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aka he has no dirt on her so more made up lies and conspiracy theories.

</li>
<li>
<p>What is your tax return forms, there’s something on there that’s missing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Trump started Birther movement against Obama every Racist in America bow to him. He is the Racist King for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She must be good, get insulted like Obama and Clinton put together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just listening to his way of slyly lying about it, makes me sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same card again 😡</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump should realise his wife is an immigrant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the mouth of the man whose children&rsquo;s mothers are immigrants except for Tiffany! Such a Hypocrite!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Just shows how scarred Trump is of a smart intelligent woman!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol&hellip; Anglo-Saxon is migrant right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if this is right, then the president should be a red Indian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone even mentioned something about where he was born or where his parents were born basically his ancestry, he would fight tooth and nail just prove that the investigators are corrupt or come up with a reason to not show his birth certificate or just say &ldquo;really I mean look at me I&rsquo;m &lsquo;white&rsquo; so what do I have to prove&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor Americans been putting with this guy way too long! He is NUTS!😵</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course he does this. And the sad thing is&hellip;. there are probably thousands of people who will believe him, hook line and sinker!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crazy when the focus should be on the American people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The line “according to the Constitution” doesn’t really correlate with the Criminal far right ideology of the President. At the end of the day, he’s in it for himself, not you, not your fellow American. It’s all about “me me Me” with this President. That’s one of the fundamental positives you will gain with a Biden Harris Administration, integrity and maturity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is everyone so surprised?  This is what 45* does.  It&rsquo;s going to get so much worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it says he&rsquo;s muslim?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is religion included in birth certificates? Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Jesus Christ himself returned, Trump would have him removed from the country.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was expecting it actually. That means he&rsquo;s scared af; his campaign is running out of ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just when you think it’s impossible for Trump to stoop any lower he does!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaders wouldn&rsquo;t say like that, just blame people blindly without knowing himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about your tax returns? Every other president has disclosed that information. Maybe there’s something you’re trying to hide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why doesn’t he show his tax returns, high school college transcripts, and yes, his birth certificate? John Stewart hounded him about it and he never produced it&hellip;. so clueless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re wrong when even fox news is saying otherwise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My words to Trump: &ldquo;Stop it&hellip; Get some help&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the foolishness of fools is folly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I heard&rdquo; &hellip; I like how your president hears all this things but never reads or research about them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trumps ads are the most hateful from a politician in a long time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is scared. He&rsquo;s intimidated and you can clearly tell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting really old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also I heard you weren&rsquo;t from the US trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how &ldquo;talented&rdquo; Trump is like his &ldquo;wife&rdquo; and his whole &ldquo;family&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump anyone who was born in American soil to parents with citizenship or not is automatically a citizen of the United States of America</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“She doesn’t meet the requirements” - a president who hasn’t learned how to read yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t he show his tax returns or Mueller report or his school grades which he &ldquo;aced&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there something on them he doesn&rsquo;t want us to see?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The liar in chief is really scared of Kamala what a weak little child and his cult will believe him.  they all love to hate together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear to god if trump gets elected even after how he’s handling the issues going on in this country right now I’m moving to the moon

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s getting desperate. He knows his going to loose this election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a shame that we have a sitting president of the United States who is a liar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s pet is repeating all his flopped tactics all over again. Can&rsquo;t wait for him to get out and into jail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t have to hit below the belt, just face the challenge like a man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KAMALA HARRIS was BLACK for 55 years now that she&rsquo;s gonna be Vice President in November now she&rsquo;s NOT BLACK  and she was&rsquo;nt BORN in the  USA SMFH 🤯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I expected this, but it’s honestly laughable he even has the audacity to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is a fool 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why they not questioning his wife&hellip;😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still hasn’t shown his tax returns, since he can’t follow suit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re American, please vote with us to get this clown out of the White House</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump gives a pass to immigrants and people who are not born here as long as their skin is white, for example&hellip; Melania Trump 🤷🤦</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Trump finishes reading the Bible, he should have a go at The Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that trump mentioned “Maybe it says he’s muslim” like what’s wrong with that? It’s a religion not a race. also i’m pretty sure it can’t state your religion on your birth certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He truly is a horrible and disgusting being of unknown origin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people still support Trump after 3 and half years of his Presidency, nothing new revealed about how deplorably racist he is at this point will cause them to stop supporting their cult leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was expected. Anyone surprised?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thar he blows again, banking on his favorite uneducated followers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about it. I just heard about it&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somebody should tell Mr. Fatty McLoud Mouth that if he doesn&rsquo;t know about something he shouldn&rsquo;t talk about it. Especially considering the fact that he&rsquo;s an influential person and also the POTUS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is a saying in my mother tongue: the tail of a dog will never get straight

<li>
<p>We should demand that he shows his tax returns before he can be in the ballot this time!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here we go again with lunacy from Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of Trumps parents were from another country? His Mum should have dropped him in the Toilet and flushed twice🤣 As in 2 full flushes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is what happens when you run out of arguments or when you know that you are going to lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that case, ship Melania back to wherever she&rsquo;s from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about his children ? Most of his wives are not American born</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he&rsquo;s in a pickle, he makes rumors on the birth of people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why hasnt Trump released his tax return? What is he trying to hide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does that when he can&rsquo;t find any fault with a person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HERE WE GO AGAAAIN..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So that lawyer was a sore looser and the President is a sore “about to be looser”!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trumps mother wasn&rsquo;t born in the US maybe someone needs to look in to his birth certificate 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, some people are saying&hellip;&quot;. His go to opening when he&rsquo;s ready to spew a lie or conspiracy.  Sad..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where was this at when ted Cruz was born in Canada? Oh right, he&rsquo;s white.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s  so stupid it&rsquo;s not funny trying it just like Obama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I may not see her as &ldquo;African American&rdquo; per se (more West Indies American) , but she is definitely a natural born citizen and trump needs to stop being racist!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I heard only&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>President of US now earned the awards for &lsquo;hate speech&rsquo;,but I don&rsquo;t know,I heard only</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe Trump is Russian , we can&rsquo;t tell , he could be a child of an orangutang , he could have been born in a zoo in NY  .

<p>President Pinocchio using his special powers to take down the enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sort of thing has gone from outrageous, to a disease. The only cure is to vote Blue in Nov.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s more of an American then trump ever will be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did this to Obama, to the group of congress women, and now to Harris. The dude just deeply hates people of color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is everyone agreeing that Harris will one day be President?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This why Biden picked her. Because the right will take the bait</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don &ldquo;The Hoax&rdquo; Trump needs to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know anyone with a parent who wasn&rsquo;t born in this country? The Showerhead President.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I don’t know about it I just heard about it I’ll take a look” is not promoting the theory&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Democrats did check the requirements before announcing her&hellip;that&rsquo;s why they announced her duh and she serves in Congress which requires you to be a US citizen as well so just more stupidity. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant believe people still listen to this bad,sick soul</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol and his parents were immigrants we should start asking him for his brith certificate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is embarrassing. How can the leader of a country encite so much hate between the citizens?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He says I dont know if its true. How about you find out before you talk about it? Someone should have JFK&rsquo;d this guy by now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To take over land where peaceful natives lived for ages, then claim everyone else who comes in is an immigrant, is just about the most evil and ignorant thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its about time that the press listed just the stuff that is true coming out of his mouth.  A much much shorter list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should say &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s make it a double reveal. I&rsquo;ll show my birth certificate and you can show your tax returns&rdquo;. He has less than 100 days to fulfil his election promise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How stupid can Trump and Pence be to come op with the same conspiracy. It didn&rsquo;t work before and won&rsquo;t work this time. It&rsquo;s birthtir conspiracy recycling gone bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they her this was Obama also??? Rolls eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here we go again

<p>Here we go again! Of course he gonna try this ol’ trick, but it’s not gonna work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just scared to kamala</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone who actually saw the press conference knows this is not accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont see why anyone would prevent Harris from running&hellip; paired with sleepy Joe, this garentees Trumps re-election!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John oliver: guys its jarred&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>IT IS JUST JARRED😂😂😂😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attention (!) We will do our best to end america’s existence as a country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump: I only heard the news this morning, we&rsquo;ll see how the investigation goes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liberals: WACIST!!!! REEEEEEEEE!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s promoting it.&rdquo; Are you kidding? He&rsquo;s the president of the US. According to him, he&rsquo;s spreading a racist conspiracy theory when he &lsquo;doesnt even know if it&rsquo;s true.&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geez, America sure did downgrade with the current president. 🤦‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dang sounds like he’s QUOTING what someone said about her, literally said he didn’t know anything about it&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t he show his tax returns?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar argument he thrown about Obama. Duh! 🤦‍♂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Jared was any sort of man at all, he would spare/save his family from being attached to this malignancy we call an administration and go against the lunacy of his father-in-law. But, no. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s competing with his wife and in-laws to be &ldquo;daddy&rsquo;s favorite&rdquo;. The moment disgusting rumors were floated about Ivanka he should have had the good sense to go private and not have her involved in something that could only do her and his family&rsquo;s public image harm in the long-term. Donnie&rsquo;s not gonna be here forever. They will be here for quite a while. They&rsquo;ll have to deal with the blowback for possibly the rest of their lives. But still he continues to do the sick old man&rsquo;s bidding like a faithful trained poodle. What kind of man worth his salt would tolerate that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When anyone says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be honest&rdquo;.. don&rsquo;t believe them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer.&rdquo;  Says the guy who met Michael Cohen and decided  &ndash; this is the lawyer for me!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn’t he just clearly say “I hadn’t heard anything about it”?? How is that pushing the theory? He didn’t bring it up. He didn’t write the article. What are you talking about?

<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s disgusting bringing that up again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That &ldquo;very highly qualified very talented lawyer&rdquo; should answer some questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmaooo that &ldquo;very talented&rdquo; lawyer is SALTY! With a capital S! 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are we talking about Willy Browns ex girlfriend 😂 who cares she&rsquo;ll never get near the Whitehouse thank goodness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait until he&rsquo;s out of office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can tell he&rsquo;s completely lying. I&rsquo;ll be glad when we never have to hear him speak again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geez chump seriously? I&rsquo;m embarrassed for both of us 🤦</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since when being a &ldquo;very qualified, very talented LAWYER&rdquo; is a testemony of being correct, or at least not being a spawn of Satan for that matter&hellip;.sorry to all lawyers out there, but you guys know its true!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hes doing this because his DHS is illegally given a job he can&rsquo;t take</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So for trump everyone that looks slightly brown/dark wasn&rsquo;t born in the United States? Thats not racist at all mr trump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does he ever hear himself ? Like&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice how he says the issue is &lsquo;she wasn&rsquo;t born in this country&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s really that her parents weren&rsquo;t born in the US. So where was POTUS&rsquo; mother born?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a joke! 😂🤣😭.. Vote him out!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This whole video is a lie, NowThis just assumes your won’t look into it for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That makes the entire Trump clan ineligible because Donald&rsquo;s father was born in Germany.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just dusting off a classic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man does not know when to stop with his insults and lies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s crazy the amount of lies he tries to spread!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The donald and his family didnt have an issue with her when he was a Democrat and donated to her . Duh&hellip;.. why now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guess Fox news ain&rsquo;t getting paid enough these days😅😂

</li>
<li>
<p>The Cheeto in Chief is just a verbal version of The National Inquirer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remember when trump did this to obama? apparently obama won the election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘The historic peace deal’&hellip; the unrest between UAE and Israel has had zero impact on the western world, it is not a priority right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s a citizen of the United States of America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess anyone that doesn’t look like him must not be born here 🤦‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean he clearly said he didn&rsquo;t know if it was true in the whole press conference video but it&rsquo;s okay we have a very objective/honest press right ????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone that is taken in by his rhetoric and propaganda wants to be lied too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They must do, his lies so transparent and completely without substance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump said “I don’t know about it, I just heard about it. Il take a look.” Leftist deceit as per the usual. Promoting a lie? You’ll hear far more negativity/slander coming from Kameltoe and Biden about Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He literally just answered the question😂🤦‍♂️ didn’t say he believed that she wasn’t eligible at all. You liberals continue to baffle me🙄😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange guy then: Where&rsquo;s Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange guy now: Was she born here, her parents are immagrants.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Dude: Where are your taxes and that Great Wall you were gonna build? Look at America, it is in it&rsquo;s WORST status, NOW. Not great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t he show his tax returns? That&rsquo;s the non-conspiratorial, legit, non- bigoted, question that still hasn&rsquo;t been answered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am stunned at the level of incompetence and pathetic lies that surface out this administration .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His wife wasn’t born in this country&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never got a job because of my skin color or gender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s qualified people saying that&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I keep hearing&rdquo; what an obvious and smeary way to promote ridiculous innuendos.  It&rsquo;s a filthy way to divide and still this person has a chance to be re-elected?

<p>No the lie is that Trump has anything to do with the story. He said I don’t know. More fake news.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“this is news” actually this is propaganda but okay i guess people who aren’t old enough to vote yet will get brainwashed lol as if that means anything to the real world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a blunt liar!  People what have you got for a president?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harris is the Illuminati&rsquo;s choice but she will going down with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when Rubio was born in Canada?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birtherism is only back when your a POC   🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If she became President. Microsoft&rsquo;s head, Google&rsquo;s head and me (no one) will be very happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we fail to speak up when lies are propagated, when truth is thrown to the air&hellip; Just to serve an objective&hellip;. Well, welcome to the matrix, what we face today is our collective failure in not standing up against falsehood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s worse then COVID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:52 Since when do birth certificates say anything about someones religion? Isn&rsquo;t that something a person chooses later in life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liar liar America is on fire in California, where Kamala was born.🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I was his son I would separate from him, and anyone who supports this kind resources wasting non-sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many Americans voted for this man?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Politician: isnt white</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Republicans: ZOMG R THEY EVEN BORN FWOM HEERE?!??1!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our federal goverment knows exactly how to pick the masters of deception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s scared of her!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who needs lies when Harris locked up people she knew to be innocent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are they all just fighting over whose voice is the loudest?</p>
</li>

<p>I love how you guys misrepresent everything and twist it to fit your agenda.

</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, right. Now it&rsquo;s something that is out there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uttered en passantly by an orange that knows just that: if it&rsquo;s out there it will be being spread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same activists who say Ted Cruz can become president even though he was born in Canada?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s grandfather came from Germany, how is that different from Kamala&rsquo;s parents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:39 the most complacent and most smug smile you will ever see&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Republicans don’t speak out against this nonsense, that means they’re ok to present themselves as racists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude needs to sniff his uppers, he is WAY down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can he actually speak without lying?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:39 Jared Kushner on the right has a very punchable face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first obama, now harris, i like how, according to them, anyone of color whos running against them CLEARLY must not be from America, just noooo way am i right? way to have a mindset from the 40;s, idiots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So basically any black person that’s running for the White House is actually from another country. Gotcha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He literally  didn&rsquo;t  even bring it up,  the journalist brought it up and he gave his comments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happened to draining the swamp, building the wall, Mexico paying for the border wall, repeal and replacing health care, do I need to continue more Trump&rsquo;s failed promises?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any suggestion by this &ldquo;president&rdquo; , that Kamala would in any way not &ldquo;qualify &quot; is an absolute outrage,  he himself was never qualified for anything, I wouldn&rsquo;t let him walk my dog!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest&hellip; Is anyone really surprised by this? 🤦🏾‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is he smiling what the whole family even the walk ins are a different kind ofSpecies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can we start questioning trumps place? he always projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
