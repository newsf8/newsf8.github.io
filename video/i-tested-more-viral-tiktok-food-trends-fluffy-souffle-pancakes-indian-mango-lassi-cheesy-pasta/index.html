<li>
<p>MANGO LASSI was quite authentic. It&rsquo;s available in practically every single Indian restaurant in the US. It&rsquo;s the bestttt 🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a former cashier I can tell you I am just thinking about how I want to go home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David’s college nickname was “a creamy chicken surprise”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I drink Mango Lassi practically everyday as it is summer now. The canned kesar mango pulp that you get in the indian stores here works wonderfully!!!😋😋😋</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a baker that&rsquo;s been separating eggs with my hands for years. Only a heathen would dare separate eggs without washing their hands first. Also, egg shells are jagged and sharp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just wash your hands really well before separating the yolks from the whites. That&rsquo;s the only way i do it and it works every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to mention thats its ok to seperate eggs with your hands as lomg as you wash them this will not only save you time and will guarantee no broken yolk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we all just take a second and appreciate the fact that his video has an ad for Philadelphia Cream Cheese!!!! 😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t use the shell to separate eggs not only does it introduce bacteria from the exterior of the shell but also it can cause the yolk to break.  Using your hands is fine as long as you’ve recently washed them. Washing your hands obviously makes this more sanitary but also reduces the oils on your hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet every cashier that meets David thinks he insane, just buying Oreos, Pasta, Spinach, Artichoke dip, and garlic knots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David! Take advantage of your blonde and add some temporary purple or something!! It&rsquo;s a youtuber rite of passage to have crazy colored hair at some point 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indian here. I’ve lived in the US for a couple years. Mango lassi tastes very different in US even if the method is exactly the same. Maybe it’s the taste of the milk or mango. Also, we add a touch of clotted cream on top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought it was pretty hilarious that David was talking about Molly being proud of him for his pasta water salinity while simultaneously POURING OUT HIS PASTA WATER 😂🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>damn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got here quick with no notifs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice! Everyone knew what the soufflé pancake would look like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That off aftertaste in the alfredo dish is the starches they coat the pre shredded cheese with so they don&rsquo;t clump.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Cream of chicken soup is basically chicken stock and heavy cream with a butt ton of salt

<p>I work in a restaurant and have to seperate eggs every day for Meringue’s. We all use our hands because the shells break the eggs. Never had a problem with the oils in our hands&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should have Rie try to &lsquo;Make It Fancy&rsquo; with the canned chicken soup mix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I just say thank you for a bizarre reason. When I was in grade school I moved from the NJ/NY area down to WV about 33 years ago. I had a half memory of grocery store named Food something and there was a local grocery store named Food something else that shutdown 20 or so years ago. I couldn&rsquo;t remember which place had Foodtown and which had Foodland&hellip; Your vinegar finally answered my question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David: indian mango lassi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: finally some indian cuisine!😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never put cream in with lassi. We usually go with just yogurt as the dairy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please stop using metal on nonstick pans. It hurts me deep inside whenever I see people do this. Use wooden or even better, silicone on nonstick pans. Metal will erode and scratch the nonstick coating away. Please no more metal on nonstick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this channel a few years ago when you had less then 100k and I instantly fell in love with these videos. Definitely the fastest I’ve ever subscribed to a YouTuber. Keep up the good work!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mango you used won&rsquo;t provide the sweetness and richness that of a Indian/Pakistani Mango.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best would be to have a fresh mango from that country (very seasonal and expensive) or alternatively canned..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think someone else mentioned it aswell, but try the Canned Kesar Pulp. Most restaurants use that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude you are working the plaid and your hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15 year old tik tokers and Rachel Ray 🤣</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: David drop your skin care routine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;can someone explain what “gmg” on his lil white board means? I feel like I should know but I cant figure it out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love mango and I was wondering how that would taste! I will definitely try to make it when I get the chance! 💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those soufflé' pancakes look SO yummy and your styling is just fine! These videos are so fun, keep them coming David!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:22 Here&rsquo;s a tip David! Next time you wanna separate a yolk, try using just your wet hands.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might think I&rsquo;m kidding, but it&rsquo;s the best way to separate the whites from the yolk. The shell of the cracked egg usually bursts the yolk. ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanna try that FIRE Mango Lassi tho!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love a good Mango Lassi! I always get one when I get Indian food</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: spelling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should try this Chanel named &ldquo;Emma&rsquo;s Goodies&rdquo; it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always tried to make suffle pancakes though they always shrank after I transfer them to the dishes hm anyone can give me some advice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did anyone else think back to Disney&rsquo;s: Pass the Plate with Brenda Song when he first said mango lassi or am I the only one?!?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could just smell that cardamom as David was blending them, I love that smell!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:51 he lives with his parents right? And there is a wrestling match going on upstairs&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When David starts testing Tik ToK Recipes:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Why has the plague taken you too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m glad you enjoyed the lassi, it wasn’t the most authentic as we here in India and Pakistan use milk instead of cream but people like to enjoy it differently in every family. The mango definitely wasn’t what we have here but no problem if you liked it. Also it’s pronounced as “luss-eee”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey, never quit YouTube. We need you right now lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David: Takes a green mango ( Raw) , makes it into a weird form of lassi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North Indian: cuss tends to infinity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breakfast timpano when?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ayyye. Wow. One of the first comments. Love you my dude!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low-key cringing at David&rsquo;s pronunciation of lassi. Protip: it&rsquo;s luh-see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like you went into the pasta with a negative vibe. I don’t know what it tastes like since I didn’t make it&hellip;.but my family makes quite a few pasta dishes with cream of chicken in it that are amazing&hellip;. but they also don’t have dried oregano in them 😂

<p>Hey David somebody probably already told you this but I wanted to let you know. You&rsquo;re pancakes probably deflated because you used one of the squirt bottles. It takes a lot of the air out of the pancakes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love that mention of Molly and her salt intake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From what I can tell David never swears in his videos so him nearly dropping an F-bomb at the last recipe makes me really curious about it, especially since at that moment most of what was in his voice was bafflement as opposed to outright disgust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also really curious about that Mango Lassi, I&rsquo;ve never actually tried making any of the things featured on this channel before myself. But that looks really good and refreshing, and also it&rsquo;s fairly simple too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Judging by how slimy your hands are after separating eggs I highly doubt the oils on your hands will affect the whites at all. The white that touches your hand will stay on your hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❤</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I had nothing to say and I panicked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are we just going to ignore the fact that a “wrestling match” was happening😳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the fastest I&rsquo;ve ever clicked on a video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like you should do the frog bread and the frog boba.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7:40 “why in the world this recipe has 8 million views is beyond me” IM WHEEZING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He truly hates tiktok 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IHOP: We make the best pancakes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Japan: Hold my soufflé</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a European it still amazes me how American eggs can be so white</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see him try to make a good version of the pasta dish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seperate your egg yolks and whites with your hands because all the oils get in there&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who tf isn&rsquo;t washing their hands before they work with any food, let alone getting your hands in there?

<p>2:55 well it is actually just some salted or sweetened yogurt. Adding mango is like pineapple on pizza.</p>

<p>Mango lassi hack: if you can’t find good, ripe mangoes, use manga nectar</p>

<p>I always make (and even sell) cakes that has whipped whites and I&rsquo;ve always used my hands to separate my eggs and it never posed a problem for me. As long as your hands are clean all will be good</p>

<p>&ldquo;a creamy chicken surprise&rdquo; sounds like a parody of a parody porno</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that pasta look gen-z as hell 🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As someone who&rsquo;s never had either, I&rsquo;d imagine that cream of chicken is the same as cream of mushrooms, but with chicken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“How hard would it be to get some chicken stock, herbs, cheese, and make a sauce?” I don’t know, friend, why don’t you make a video on it? I’d love to see you try to improve on some of the more questionable recipes you’ve recreated for us.</p>

<p>Found your channel a few days ago, and since then, I have been on a binge.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t tell if you&rsquo;re driving or a passenger in the first row of a minivan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mango lassi is authentic and u did it right 😄😂👍🏻👍🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David, the pancake soufflés naturally deflate very quickly. You didn’t do anything wrong; they’re meant to be served immediately after being cooked or else they will deflate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>out of this whole video the thing that amazed me the most is that my pink salt is the same brand as his black pepper LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mango lassi is definitely authentic!! it’s such a classic in india</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aye! I&rsquo;m early for once, love ya David! &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m missing out because I don&rsquo;t have tik tok but I feel like the content on there moves so quickly?? LOL maybe I&rsquo;m weird but I just enjoy watching someone cook for extended periods of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh it’s 1am here in England</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am on a diet and watching this well diet goodbye and hello kitchen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;These are deceptively sweet though&rdquo;&hellip;.::pancakes dusted with powdered sugar::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why not just make milk cubes and freeze the mango instead of adding ICE to water it down 🤗</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make recipes from that Cornell food science student! His name is Jeremy something&hellip; his recipes look sooooooo good!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David ur just good human doing the thing and I wanna be ur friend irl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:00 it is actually a variation of traditional  lassi that is plain yogurt  and water and ice with option of sugar or salt  ummmmmmmmyyyyyy🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love mango lassi, you can also use mango pulp if you can&rsquo;t find actual mangos! My A/C has been broken for a few weeks, have had SOOOOO much lassi 😂. Got fixed today!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually so glad David got a chair now. I&rsquo;ve always thought how I would hate it if I had to stand to film every single video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all i know is that most chefs tend to tell alot of home chefs to just use your hands its easier and also dosent break the yolk because think about it the shell has sharp edges and points after breaking it plus the thing that the person said about oil form your hands hindering egg whites from whipping up is bs the amount of oil on ones hads has to be literally dunked in oil to cause that XD plus if thats a thing u think causes it just wash your hands . im not good with grammer never have never will be have aspergers so please be nice  allways one of my constant fears is someone flaming something i say cause i cant punctuate properly ro write a coherent sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay look I loved the video but I can&rsquo;t get over David pronouncing Lassi (luh-s-see) wrong every time he says it (also if you have sweet enough mango, the sugar/honey isn&rsquo;t needed and the mango flavor that comes through is just <em>chef&rsquo;s kiss</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That intro filming and moving his hand while driving makes me so anxious!!! Plase tell me he has a Tesla, cause if not its incredible irresponsable!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think your pancakes deflated because the heat was probably TOO low. So it lost its gas and &ldquo;melted&rdquo; instead of setting fluffier.

<li>
<p>Seeing that you&rsquo;ve uploaded a video is always the highlight of my day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I see Mango (or what y&rsquo;all have to consume as Mango) I feel sad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come to Kenya (India,Jamaica, Sri Lanka etc) when we can travel again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been binging your channel all day and then you post! This made my day 😊💙</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: love your outro song btw, it always has me dancing at the end of ur videos lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular lassi (unflavoured), made solely out of curd and sugar and churned in a bath of ice is more common in india than the other kind, we get it almost in every street in North india.</p>
</li>

<p>5:45 8 year old me coming home from school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pasta with chicken cream soup was one of my favorite late-teens dish. 🤭Did not put cheese in the sauce, put milk instead of water, a bit of cayenne pepper, cumin and thyme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i tried soufflé pancakes less than an hour ago, ofcourse i failed and they turned out flat, but still super good and they looked great too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good thing I finished my work early. might&rsquo;ve missed being early to watch this video. unless?? hmmmm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he deserves more recognition !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thought you&rsquo;d make dalgona coffee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about trying something healthy; like Chloe Ting recipes</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Cream of chicken was always my favorite soup as a kid, it’s like a creamy chicken soup gloop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this series is like rice pudding. no one&rsquo;s gonna be super sad that a restaurant doesnt have it on the menu, there are better dishes, but when served, no one complains, and you can only hear the sounds of eating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:46 hmmm i wonder what’s goin on upstairs 🤔

<p>Oh this makes me kind of sad. Growing up my mom used Cream of Chicken soup in EVERYTHING. So now I absolutely love it. I will concede that the texture of it is pretty weird.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching him make a mango lassi without Alphonso mangos kinda killed me more than his pronunciation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My niece is addicted to mango lassi, they&rsquo;re really delicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry but it hurt me when he pronounced mango lassi&hellip; the a is more like an uh sound :) love your videos and binging them through quarantine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always made mango lassi and I really enjoy it except I literally had no idea it&rsquo;s an authentic Indian drink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always use my hands to seperate eggs and I have never had a problem with them not whipping?  Anyone else??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not that im defending it but, you messed up big time when you opted for &ldquo;98% fat free&rdquo; Cream of chicken. That stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is disgusting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow one minute ago and already this many comments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David you’re glowing ✨✨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cream of Chicken is good in rice with some extra chicken pieces, cheese (I&rsquo;ve used velveta before) and baked with shredded cheddar on top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dont worry about the pancakes , ive tried that recipe at least 30 times and ive never achieved fluffy pancakes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am surprised that you&rsquo;ve never heard of mango lassi! I&rsquo;ve been living in Germany for a year now and it&rsquo;s available in every asian restaurant here, and even over the counter in the supermarket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought mangoes had like huge pits&hellip;. I know they do, is that a special breed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David, you should try one of Tabitha Browns( a TikTokers) vegan recipes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mango lassi&rsquo;s our one of my favorite drinks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just went into his subscriptions and he likes Seamus Gorman to !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David how come there’s an add for cream cheese?🤨 Ironic?🤷🏾‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you driving and making a youtube intro or are you in the passenger seat</p>
</li>

<p>I hope youre the passenger

<p>dont drive while distracted dude cmon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That pasta dish might be good if it had a velouté base (stock thickened with flour and butter), freshly-shredded cheese, and fresh herbs.  At that point, you&rsquo;d have something similar to Tetrazzini.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love you videos David. Thanks for always working so hard for great quality videos!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>depending on how temperamental your recipe is with the egg whites I&rsquo;ve never had a problem just using my hands to separate yolks as long as they&rsquo;re freshly washed. Maybe something sensitive like an actual souffle might benefit from not using your hands but I feel like most of the time hands are fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>«Pancakes seem to be more sweet than the ones I previously made 🤔🤔🤔»</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Maybe it’s cause of all that additional sugar and syrup on them?&hellip; American tastebuds, I guess lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:47 bro just wash your hands before you cook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That lassi makes me want to eat some hot chole bhature with a tall glass of lassi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also that lassi is pretty authentic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you wash your hands properly the amount of oil on your skin that gets in the egg whites is pretty negligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cool video!!A quick note I&rsquo;ve found useful try using your hands as sieves to separate the eggs from the whites. The shells have sharp edges so chance of breaking the yolk is higher. So just do the same process but from one hand to the other!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always use my hands to separate eggs and a knife to cleanly crack the egg first (it&rsquo;s the only way the yolks don&rsquo;t break for me) and I&rsquo;ve never had a problem&hellip; it may not be in good practice but I never had a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David I&rsquo;ve left some texts in your dm. Please reply me🥺🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Cream of&rdquo; soups are disgusting. 🤢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so like im relatively new to the channel and i keep hearing about this beef with rachel ray, can someone inform me ☠️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The oil in egg whites is a myth. How to cook that debunked it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not @ how this is the only thing i look forward to on friday 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t have more subscribers, when people like Steph Papas has so many</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the metal straw used for that mango lassi, heard they&rsquo;re pretty bad for a lot of people but it&rsquo;s nice to see someone like David Seymour reducing the use of plastic straws that&rsquo;d end up in lots of oceans and seas. Well done

<p>I never seen cardymum or honey in laasi but basically it’s fine, there’s more Indian stuff you can add to change it up and your pronunciation of laasi cringes me out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an indian I&rsquo;m v impressed with the lassi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also I never take maple syrup with my pancakes. I always take honey smh. Unpopular opinion, honey&gt;maple syrup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the most left-field weird recipes you can find</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought this said this video was 42 min long but I’m just early to this video. I was pretty exited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:53 the cycle of life 😹😹</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an Indian, can cofirm that mango lassi was fantastic!!! 10/10 would try 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check out the korean or japanese youtuber recipes for the souffle pancake and I guarantee it would be good since I already tried making them for a few times and they were sooo good and not deflate as much as yours , that would probably cause by the recipe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since you liked the lassi so much, you should try making another desi dish. Make kier, which is basically rice pudding. It’s really good!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitely would watch David struggle with some complex Indian food like I (an Indian) have lmaoooo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you driving while filming? Don&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry david</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its authentic mango lassi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of heavy cream we use yogurt thats all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were Italian I&rsquo;ll get mad at this 😭💔😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was waiting for this! Thanks for officially making my Friday PERFECT! 😘</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Found the video 23 minutes after upload. didnt even mean to find this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hand thing is a lie! I do it all the time and it’s never been a problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love mango lassi it&rsquo;s so goooood

<p>👁👄👁 me waiting for David to transition and make his own version of the pasta</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bruh i found one of ur vids and i tought it was just the one video no all ur vids are leached off of others when u gonna get ur own content , and u sponser plug aswell XD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HERE SO EARLY. love youu david</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yesss lassi is awesome! try adding some coconut milk to mango lassi, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way David is saying lassi I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m sorry 😖😖</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i laughing at the way her said newt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you PLEASE do a video on protein dessert recipes that youtubers swear on! like greg doucettes pancakes, protein cheesecake, things like that!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:55 kids in Africa would have loved that food</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For easier mango cutting: precut the mango “cheek” in diamonds then scoop out or pop it out and scrape it on the cup/bowl! Hope this helps you guys 💕</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David the hand oil situation isn’t true. There’s a reason 99% of professional chefs use their hands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we gotta get on that beef wellington my dude</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mango lassi wasn&rsquo;t traditional or authentic but I&rsquo;m glad you liked it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mango lassi seems to be quite authentic actually, i am pleasantly surprised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never had mango lassi before and I’m south Asian 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loved the video though!❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey David!! big fan!! It&rsquo;s very India :) and authentic. You can put in any kinda spice you want to us (kesar would do) :) You should try aam panna someday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lasse is amazing, also a very good hangover cure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAVID!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IS YOUR HAIR NORMAL FINALLY :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahhh, the mangoes we get in India are sooo different tho! You should get your hands on them, if possible!

<p>No one will probably see this, aside from me cause I&rsquo;m a nobody, but you can use your hands to separate egg whites and things will work just fine. The secret is&hellip;you have to wash them thoroughly before you separate them <em>gasp</em>. I&rsquo;m talking full abc song, 20-30 seconds, lather it up baby washing. Dry your hands after then separate your eggs, not touching anything oily before going to work with your eggs. Also, never use a plastic or wooden bowl to whip egg whites in. Those bowls are porous and can absorb oils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try Indian Cuisine please, Love from India!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, more vegetarian recipes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need more of theseeee the roasts are too good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s pronounced &ldquo;Luh-see&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So i thougt cream of chicken was some sort of chicken stock and dairy mixture.. and after googling i just want to know why anyone decided it was necessary to sell this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been so early, hi mom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be that person but I hope you wore a mask while at the store (obviously this doesn&rsquo;t apply if you pre-recorded this video before masks were recommended). Just stay safe pls!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he tales a 2nd bite you know  its good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check our mythical kitchen and recreate someOf those recipes.  I’m thinking the funnel cake grilled cheese and the ice cream burrito</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those pancakes looked amazing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That last recipe&hellip; I use cream of chicken and I&rsquo;d never add that cheese to it.. who thought of that.  Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow I thought you were setting it up to improve that chicken goop pasta&hellip; and then the video ended</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woulda prolly been fire with cream of mushroom. Cream of mush ftw every time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way he said Lassi 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In India, People drink MANGO LASSI Like everyday, during summers. :p</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t drive and record a video, David. Others might get the same idea and they can&rsquo;t see whether it was perfectly safe when you did it, and why it would have been. Otherwise i like the concept of these new videos with a collection of faster recipes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like plain Lassi the best! And Salted Lassi is great too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the lassi, , the traditional is just yogurt ice and suger maybe little milk, blended together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it’s time that we all need a cut your hair at home video!

<p>Things I learned from Tik Tok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blending granulated sugar gives you powdered Sugar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really tired of YouTubers saying &ldquo;ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls&rdquo; or variations of it. Like can you please acknowledge that nonbinary people exist? It&rsquo;s so frustrating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the point of summer where I  can&rsquo;t stand mangoes anymore and I&rsquo;d try any variation of food made with mango to get through them. But i haven’t tried mango lassi before idk why. So gotta try that. Love plain lassi so i Don&rsquo;t see it going wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It hurts my soul to watch people use metal utensils on nonstick pans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since you already have powdered sugar in the pancakes just squeeze some lemon juice on it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can you do @jeremyscheck &rsquo;s spicy rigatoni??? that&rsquo;d be so cool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can add your fave alcohol to the mango lassi!! If you wanna be more adventurous😉😉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love the vids can you test tasty&rsquo;s simple cheese its</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can put literally 1tsp of oil into the egg whites and will still whip up, so &ldquo;getting any oil at all into the whites will not allow it to whip is a myth.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can you do a video on crazy food trends like glitter lattes, cereal milk ice cream, and levain cookies!!! love your videos my guy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am just gonna say it before someone points it out😂 you completely butchered the word Lassi, it was so weird to hear it but anyways! Goodjob making it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just came back from the private video and it feels like i came from a different dimension</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he is so handsome. i need a man with them hands, that dedication, and some cute hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wow what a nice knife you used to cut up that mango!! 👀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>david not just your knife skills scare me but also you driving with a camera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yaaaaaas! The &ldquo;Lassi&rdquo; is just a sweet yoghurt+cream based drink. It can be any flavor depending on what you add, like Mango, in this case. Strawberry lassi is also AMAZING btw. And now that I think of it, it would taste heavenly with pina colada :p</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oils in your egg whites is a myth. Ann Reardon tested it in one of her videos by pouring some oil into a bowl of egg whites, and they still whipped up just fine. Professional bakers use their hands to separate eggs all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just a little advice when the pasta is done drain it from water &amp; don’t wash it just put some olive oil  and mix it so the past don&rsquo;t stick together but not too much oil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to look at your reaction video but Tik Tok is now banned in India lmao
