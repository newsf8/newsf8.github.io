<p>This is why I love the internet! Back in the day, you would either have to know someone who bought the piece of crap, or you would have to buy the piece of crap yourself in order to know if it was good or a piece of crap. Now you can just look stuff up and save your time and money! Keep up the good work with the videos!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just a recommendation - When testing tape like this&ndash; you don&rsquo;t want any overhang outside of the object you adhere to. By leaving extra, and not pressing it down like the section under the brick you gave it a starting point to begin separation which can decrease the potential weight limit. Ideally you would want a -1mm gap between the edge of the brick and tape, but undersizing is better than oversizing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wash &amp; reuse types of tapes I have used have always said to wash with a mild soap to bring back the stickiness, idc if that would help with these tapes or not just giving my little input. üòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next episode should be paint gadgets to fix your walls. Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cannot be the only one who sees the notification that #FreakinReviews has uploaded a new vid!  ü•≥üéâü§òüèΩ</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I love your channel and I am impressed with how you give honest reviews of products and don‚Äôt rely on the Name of a product.  The reviews are fair and thorough, with plenty of explanation of each test.  You are clear, concise and well articulated.   That said, Bailey is an adorable and beautiful dog, I love seeing her face and boopable nose.  Oh yeah, the sunglasses&hellip;&hellip;.. you‚Äôve got a very cool collection. ( the John Lennon-like specs look best  )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My experience with this is great: I wanted to stick a dashcam to the windscreen, the original sticker was mangled, I tried hot glue, 3m doublesided.. to no avail. This tape held great. No bricks I know. But.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm glad someone finally made a review of nano tape. I‚Äôv been looking for a real video review for months on it because I‚Äôv been thinking of getting one but I‚Äôm glad I waited. Before this video I‚Äôv only found really short videos of people just using it but not actually talking about them or reviewing the products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t in the market for nano tape before this test, and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m still not in the market for it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next I would like to see you make a glass boat using Flex Seal clear glue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for your tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the review - I&rsquo;ve just bought some prior watching your vid. I&rsquo;m going to use it to stick a powerboard or two onto a vertical smooth melamine surface so I&rsquo;m expecting good results. It will be permanent so I don&rsquo;;t expect the on/off issues you had. We shall see!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always look forward to these videos. LOL one day i said to someone yey i got another Freakin Review video coming up later , should have seen the look they gave me because they thought i was crazy haha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it would hold better in a vertical position instead of horizontally like you did it, but it would still damage the wall. It would have more surface area to adhere to vertically. Good review! Thanks! I&rsquo;d say there are a few uses for this, but one roll would probably last a lifetime if you only used it where it worked&hellip;.meaning it wouldn&rsquo;t work for many things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are so thorough and so good.  Very well thought-out demo.  You&rsquo;re my Ralph Nader of home stuff.  Keep up the good work.  Very helpful.  Thanks. -Siena in Seattle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double stick tape is a wonder isn‚Äôt it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the rug test!  I work in furniture industry and I have to help people with area carpets all the time, we use different styles of rug pads depending on the application but they are expensive&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So seems this stuff is good on metal, some wood, glass, tile, and granite. I just wanted it for hanging knives maybe on the side of the fridge. Thanks this helped cause I was worried about paint peel. üëç

<p>Now I know the three things James cares about the most: Bailey, Noah and Brandon and most importantly, his steel soap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am glad I checked you out before buying. Thank you for sharing.  :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like it works on non-porous surfaces but it may cause damage to whatever you&rsquo;re hanging.  Thanks for the review! :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was one the people requesting a review for this nano tape, thanks man for delivering!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much appreciated!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very entertaining review!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used this &ldquo;nano&rdquo; tape to mount the steel washers that were included with my Wyze security cams. The indoor-only camera has a magnet in its base, so applying the trimmed tape to the steel washer made it simple to put wherever I wanted the camera to go. The only weight it holds is the washer, the camera (100g), and the actual USB cord to plug it in. Of those, the USB cord was probably the heaviest component. No issues so far, but the acid test will come when I want to remount it somewhere else. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t take the paint off the drywall, but I guess I&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome video. Love the way you review for the viewers. üòä</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANK YOU so much for going to all this work.  I was thinking of buying some but not now.  You did a GREAT JOB!!!  I hope you make good money from YouTube because your videos are very very informative. thanks so much!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been using this stuff for a time and in everyday scenarios it&rsquo;s realy good. They have been holding an LED strip for months now, it ain&rsquo;t moving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love these videos. Next time i will check your site for reviews of a products before i get reaped off again. Thanks James. Stay safe and God Bless you and Your Family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cool shades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just the kinda 60‚Äôs Lennonesque style I use myself. Love round sunglasses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude!!!!, your editing skills are getting good bro. great review. as always</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To remove the tape you can stretch it to remove it instead of removing like regular tape, similar to those sticky Command hooks. Also letting the tape hold up something overnight before applying weight helps with adhesion, so if you put a shelf-like thing up, you wait before adding weight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only did I learn more about Nano tape, but I also learned my ABC‚Äôs!!! Thanks!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had seen this stuff and debated picking up a roll to add to my adhesives collection, but I&rsquo;m glad I saw this before I bothered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as always James thanks for doing these. I always like these type of things, but I will pass on the nano tape. great idea but not perfect enough for what I would want to use it for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My dogs name is Bailey too.  She is a black schnauzer mix.  The exact opposite of your Bailey.  Plus your Bailey is probably nice and behaves.  My Bailey is a complete nightmare. But I still love her.  Thanx for the review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thanks for reviewing this! I keep seeing these ads on IG and was considering getting a roll. I dont need it that bad.

<p>Like these reviews as it saves us time from knowing how and when to use something without wasting our time to see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;Thanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for reviewing this product. I just saw an ad for this on tv under the name &ldquo;Alien&rdquo; tape. I was impressed by your last test with the toothpaste and razor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But, I now see that using it to attach something valuable long term to a wall is too risky. A picture under glass. Never.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for sharing this! I am so glad I didn&rsquo;t buy the Nano Tape!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank u so much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bought the tape but didn‚Äôt used it yet and ur review was so helpful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So glad we have you to prevent us from buying some of this stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for testing them I almost order them till I researched reviews.  Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the back of picture frames and rugs, you could probably apply some kind of single sided non disruptive tape that adheres just fine to the surface without marring it, and then stick the double sided tape to that. I bought some of this tape on a whim and now have to make it functional to excuse the expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another great video! Have you ever considered dropping Gillette and those cartridge type razors? I switched to a d.e. safety razor and wow what a difference! Way cheaper tooüëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bought the 2&rdquo; size. The tape sticks very well to plastic items. Also once it sticks to itself, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to tear apart without ripping the tape. A coworker suggested running it under water to unstick itself, but I haven&rsquo;t tried. The bottom line is it didn&rsquo;t serve the purpose for which I bought it and, frankly, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d find a use for it in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just put this in the cart last night to purchase!  You just changed my mind.  I rent an cannot afford the paint damage. Tfs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you put the links to spackle and paint in the description too? For the repairs it promised you won‚Äôt need to do.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your poor walls, also I&rsquo;m glad you did this, I thought this tape looked like a good idea, not anymore..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have too watch&hellip;you told us the answer in the first 30 seconds üòÅ Liked!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey James! Can you please please do the Stufz Burger Maker review?! I have one and highly recommend it!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Cheers,

<li>
<p>Good review. Thanks for sharing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of work put into these videos impresses me. That&rsquo;s got to be about $60 worth of razors on that mirror. LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw a commercial for this stuff, and knew it was hype.  I would think it might work for small smooth surfaced items on a flat surface like maybe a small USB hub, on your desk so it does not move around, other than that it seems useless.  Thank you for the video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have something similar that i got a few years back but its a piece of circular black one. Its really strong(on flat smooth surface) but in contact with water it instantly becomes not sticky so it would be wiser to remove with water rather than just pulling out straight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But i wouldnt count on their reusability. Maybe a couple of times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should try Sugru Moldable Glue, it&rsquo;s a silicone based substance that after exposure to air allows you to mold it for a while into whatever shape you want, and after about an hour to set I think (or preferably, overnight) it has turned into a flexible seal.  It&rsquo;s supposed to be waterproof, weatherproof, electrically insulating, holding up to 2KG, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They stuck to each other better than anything !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I certainly wished I had watched this before buying both products! Thank you for your service. I&rsquo;ll be wiser next time! üôÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the RC hobby industry we just call this servo tape. Best just to make it a good glue and non reusable. It‚Äôs just a couple bucks a roll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old stuff would hold down servos which are a little motorized arm that swings back and forth to steer a rudder or wheels. Strong stuff!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i assume those work like a suction cup, forming like a vacuum between the surfaces. a rug isnt airproof so there is no way for a vacuum. sticking some sort of rubber mat might work for the rug to have some friction. regardless, like any suction cup those tapes wont hold long since the plastic itself will eventually let air through over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I see these type of tests I often wonder why don&rsquo;t you clean both surfaces that you are sticking to. Such as the wall and the brick test, the wall would have a layer of dust on it, so in part you are sticking to dust and not the wall, thus creating your own failure. Same applies to all tests, clean both surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One thing I learned about tape and sticking for a long time, it depends mainly on temperature and vertical or horizontal.  Either you need to use a VERY strong adhesive or you need to screw it on. Or it will come off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yay a new review video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great review!! It&rsquo;s sad how many of these products are pretty much crap. üôÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seriously, if anyone wants to stick their rug down, use carpet tape from Home Depot.  It is super strong and your rug will NOT move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought you were going to pop that tooth paste tube trying to get it off the mirror. The only place it seemed to work was the ugliest place and so stupid! If I ever find the need to tape things to my mirror, I&rsquo;ll come back to edit this. Another great video though!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was recently looking at a &ldquo;sticky buddy&rdquo; those hair rollers, and I think these rolls of tape are made from the same material as that. If you pull off the strip on the sticky buddy, it&rsquo;s just like these rolls of tape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you test foldable Bluetooth keyboards? You used a big one on the travel video, but I would love to see the smaller more compact (and more protected) keyboards&hellip; That could be a good video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photo #3, I gotta ask&hellip;did you get a sammie from Cheesewalla?

<li>
<p>Love your videos man!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That stuff reminds me of the clear stretchy stuff used to seal envelopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use Gorilla mounting tape for my permanent mount dash cam.  Has not come off in over 2 years.  Great stuff for something like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bought it, and I&rsquo;m using it, I can&rsquo;t say it works really well. I have it holding up my extension leads. It falls off about once a week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t tried this product, but years ago I used some brand of two-sided tape to affix few mirror panels to a wall. Couple years later one of them fell off and another looked like it had moved a little, so I used twice the original amount of tape pieces. The mirrors have stayed there for about ten years now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And yeah, the Spider Man problem: Stuff may be able to stick to a surface, but the paint or wallpaper or whatever may not be able to hold that weight, and now it is stuck harder to the weight than the wall&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another great review. üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just curious to know how warm/hot it was outside the day you did the wall test, and if you think heat could lead to a negative result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only is this review down to earth, but I LOVE James and his presentation!  Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great test, thanks. Bought some nails and screws instead üòÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you clean the surfaces first with Alcohol and let dry thoroughly?  The items I hung up months ago, are still up;  a small pair of metal tea candle holders and 3 mirrored/metal, small deco picture frames.  To remove, use a hairdryer to loosen the product first and gently remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe just put the toothpaste upside down, and just unscrew the cap..but removing the items could be part of your early morning fitness regime! üòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just want to know if I can use this for curtain rods on an indoor brick wall - that&rsquo;s all. I think the things you&rsquo;re sticking on are weird lol &mdash; why do I want my soap to stick to the wall, or my toothpaste lol  Now photos? Yes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question. Do you think these tape rolls are the result of making tape out of the sticky rollers used for cleaning pet hair off of clothes, furniture etc. Not sure what temp the water was when you rinsed them but the rollers were rinsed in warm water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for saving me money on these purchases! I was so bought in before this video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informative as always and fun to watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems like they&rsquo;re not much good for anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dramatic pause you gave when that soap bottle fell was HILARIOUS!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was so cool i saw this on the YouTube story thing and couldn‚Äôt wait i liked and subbed btw have a good day!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your second test took freaking paint off the wall, and yet you still did like 4 more tests afterwards&hellip; Now that&rsquo;s dedication.

<p>Thanks for doing this. Most of the youtube reviews of this stuff claiming it works great are posted by people also selling the product - LOL. Not surprised, really. 3M has been selling little plastic gadgets - hooks, plant holders, speaker wire clamps, etc, with a form of this tape for years &ndash; making the same claims of reusability, strength, non-harmful to wall surfaces &amp; paint &ndash; but use of these over time proved that the same issues exist, i.e., they stop working after a while and cannot be removed without leaving a mark etc.  Bottom line, I guess, is that if they claims seem too good to be true, they probably are not that good or that true. The manufacturer(s) continue to make profits off the multiple first sales to people giving the product a try (the American Dream)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have seen other reviews of this tape with the same terrible results. Thanks for confirming it James!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give it the Bailey test; tape her toys to the floor and see how long it takes for her to get them free. My guess?? About 2 seconds&hellip;&hellip;.hahaha!! Thanks bud!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey James, those tapes, before you glue them to the wall, you have to clean the Surface with rubbing alcohol, wait for It to dry, stick the tape, wait a few hours and then put stick tour object. Appreciate your v√≠deos, and Bello from Brazil!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So glad you tested the tape.  I have been wondering about whether or not it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah I‚Äôm pissed off and disappointed in this product too! Idk what to do with the rest of it lol, any ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are being too kind, the adds are so misleading! Glad to see here how they really work before buying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your time, money and info. I have one question; when you were doing the mirror test di you actually do it day by day or just that many time?  Ok two questions, if you did do it day by day did you use the room normally such as hot showers that would steam up the mirror?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for your review and saving us money James.üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not find it reusable too, but it change my life to hang stuff anywhere without drilling holes (heating it might help to remove, like most sticky stuff, to be tried)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks, if I ever need to hang my toothpaste on a mirror, I&rsquo;ll know what to get. :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t try it on wood yet. I think that was the only thing missing. But another awesome job again James!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have wondered about that stuff. Thanks for doing the experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the rugs you should put the tape on the floor than put the rug on top of it. I think that may have worked instead of trying to put the tape directly on the rugs. But what do I know your the vet in the review game lol love the channel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gorilla Glue makes a version. We use it for success story pictures at the non-profit I work at. We put them on a painted brick wall. They work okay, but if it gets cold, they slide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks James for reviewing  the Nano tape. I thought it was a little expensive.  Glad I didn&rsquo;t waste my money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started to order some of this tape. It was free just pay shipping. So glad I listened to my gut and googled it. Google refered me to your video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANK YOU for doing this review! The commercial makes this stuff look like it takes the place of Command products so I was interested. Now, no freakin way! Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This type of product adheres to a smooth surface better (mirror) vs a rough (wall). Any dirt will interfere with its adherence. I&rsquo;m not surprised it didnt work on the rugs. To reuse it try washing it with soap &amp; water then rinse let dry. The my sticky buddy has similar gripping aspects. It requires a light wash occas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James, you crack me up man. Love these videos. You should try to stick a bunch of this to the top of your head and touch it to the ceiling. Boom, instant levitation.

<p>Thank you for doing all these reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the review! üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks so much.  I actually have this in my Amazon cart. I will definitely be deleting it. Thanks again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It feels like you‚Äôre always doing what Vivian tries does after she does it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>never use it but it might be some good idea init it what u said sooo mmmm very good review james keep up the work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per a previous comment below, PLEASE review the Flex Seal products - I would really love to know if they work to any degree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi&hellip;I live in Australia and bought a version of this tape from Wish.com and glued a rug to carpet to stop it moving and shock horror it has worked for about 4 weeks&hellip;still to try on other surfaces&hellip;Juliana</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tape! Im looking forward to this review!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks. BTW &ldquo;Fairy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr.Proper&rdquo; look very similar now to this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank YOU for saving us from these scams!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This stuff has been around for years. They use it to hold samples in magazines. And 3M make square tabs out of this stuff for mounting pictures. Its the same stuff under a new name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I m very happy to see your channel grow and groom  just wanted to say good luck for future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no clue how you would have to clean these. While drying they collect dust which reduces their stickyness by a bunch I think. Maybe you need to buy a laminar airstation lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have this tape and it works best on plastic with plastic, it holds and doesn&rsquo;t harm the plastic. I use it in my car to hold my phone. It&rsquo;s not reusable though. I only found one product that is reusable but I can&rsquo;t seem to find it any longer, purchased at auto zone, they came in a pack of 4 and are rectangular in shape, I have used it for over a year now, just rinse off and reapply, they aren&rsquo;t a tape but a thick material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when hanging tooth paste, just a ,suggestion, hang toothpaste upside down then you could just leave hung. and thank you for testing these items out. sending high vibes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank God we have U 2 show us how these products REALLY work.  Ones,  I ALMOST bought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After seeing ads on FB I always check for reviews.  You just saved me some money and possible damage to pictures or other valuables I would have used it for.  Thanks so much :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was going to buy this tape. So thank you for thisüòÉ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great review now I know it&rsquo;s not what I need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should try it on slippery surfaces such as glass or ceramic.  His basic clean is also influential.  because if it&rsquo;s dirty the dust won&rsquo;t last long

<li>
<p>This stuff works great, as long as you drive a screw through what your hanging&hellip;..lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hmm&hellip; I wonder ü§î&hellip; If I can test it by waxing the hairs off my arm. üí™üèº</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was funny watching the captions keep going &ldquo;candidacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Canada See/sea&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for all of your hard work!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks, James!!! You saved me from wasting my money on this Nano tape that should be called Nono tape. Hugs to Bailey!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been waiting for this ever since I saw the preview!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you buy it from the company believe me it&rsquo;s not that big they don&rsquo;t give you that much it&rsquo;s barely enough to do maybe four or five things so all I could use it for a was putting it on the corners of my rug to keep Devon from curling up while moving light scatter rugs but hanging a picture on the wall I don&rsquo;t think so and when it gets stretched out and gets all distorted and out of shape, and it claims the hold up for 20 pounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got them from Aliexpress as well. Performed as u mentioned. Totally cannot be reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just got some generic nano tape today sliced a piece off and stuck my fairly heavy cell phone in a case to my wall. The instructions said to hold for five minutes. I stuck it up waited a few minutes and had to really pull to get it off. No damage to the wall though. It&rsquo;s come in handy for things I won&rsquo;t be needing to stick/unstick often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>terrific review! Thank you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for the review I won&rsquo;t buy that. lol. I use a lot of tape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m Australian or because I was tidying up while I had this playing but I swear you kept saying &ldquo;Canada A, Canada B, Canada C&rdquo; I was like &ldquo;Why are you going on about multiple Canadas?!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is basically the same thing as 3M 4910 VHB tape that you can buy at pretty much any store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s made of clear acrylic foam and It&rsquo;s designed to bond stronger and stronger as more pressure is applied. There&rsquo;s actually a video floating around on the internet of a train pulling a line of train cars with nothing but 3M VBH connecting them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be fair, it looks like the wall tests really depend on what you&rsquo;re sticking it to.  The paint and picture frame cardboard came off instead of the tape no longer adhering.  Either way, it&rsquo;s certainly not reusable in any sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would say that after washing the tape you probably need to use a hair dryer or heat gun to slightly remelt the tape to restore its stickiness.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Source: I am a polymer chemist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg I would sue, that Nano tape ruined your wall and your picture frames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James, I hate to put a damper on your experiments.. and appreciate you taking the time to do these reviews.. but really, the design of your bricks, actually they are pavers, was not a good test.. The 3 ridges along the edge of each paver&hellip; which I presume is to make it easier to maintain a uniform spacing between the pavers,, a good idea in itself.. would have prevented you from getting a firm stick.. as the ridges would have held them off the wall..

<li>
<p>Thank you for taking one for the team! You&rsquo;ve saved us some money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You‚Äôre like the wild brother of Project Farm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>u need to put it on clean flat surfaces&hellip; and one time only. still better then most old types of double sided tape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strange thing is I saw another youtuber, tylertube, who used this tape&hellip;And it worked pretty well on the bricks.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I wonder if you got 3 knockoffs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh hey pic no. 3 I recognize that place, thats in san juan, puerto rico :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about reviewing the TommieCopper lower back support shirt or compare to other compression support items?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got some and it&rsquo;s useful for holding small things like remote controls. It&rsquo;s certainly not practical for other things, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think the ridges cast into the edge of the bricks affect the amount of brick surface coming in contact with the tape?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some reason I felt the need to knock on things with my knuckle when you knocked on the cinderblock wall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My main thing is the Brick test would of probably worked much better with bricks with no ridges.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also the stimulated bathroom test doesn&rsquo;t account for hand grease build up on the toothpaste and razor over time and the toothpaste likely being used 2 or 3 times a day if practicing good oral hygiene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instructions I use for all double sided tape. Press 2 items together with tape between them, hold for 20 seconds with consistent pressure across length of tape. It is amazing what a big difference this makes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish I had seen this video before purchasing a roll. I hung a cloth painting that was help by very thin and light wood strips. It fell off in 20 mins a long with paint. I put the tape on 2 sides, now I am going to try to put it on all 4 sides and see the results. I don&rsquo;t have much hopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such garbage they sell these days and liars are people. Appreciate your reviews. You go the extra mile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We used to call that &ldquo;snot tape&rdquo;. it&rsquo;s the same material that junk-mailers used to close envelopes. The rubbery junk that you can roll off the paper and it looked like a booger. Finally! Trash snot tape is available to anger the public further!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never used it before. From your review I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it. Thanks for the review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This stuff is so unpredictable. I have tried the flex tape brand and some times it great and sometimes it‚Äôs not so great. this looks ok maybe. üòÖ

<li>
<p>Finally an honest review!!  thanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a product I want you to review.  Nay, an experience.  It is not really advertised.  I sort of stumbled into it after rats or squirrels or something chewed through a wiring harness in my car, borking it badly.  I searched for some way to prevent it from happening again.  And I came upon a product.  The product.  It&rsquo;s called Rat-A-Way.  If you view the website (<a href="http://www.rataway.com">www.rataway.com</a>) I think you will notice right away that this product is not a mass-produced thing.  And the individual who is selling (and I assume making) it is certainly a character.  I can promise you that every step of the way, you will get content for a very entertaining and interesting video.  Make sure to open the package you get on video.  I can&rsquo;t really testify to its effectiveness&hellip; I mean, my cars wires have not been chewed through again so it might be perfect.  But I never had such a problem in the decade+ I&rsquo;ve lived here so whatever rodent caused me an issue might be gone so not sure&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TylerTube did a review of this about a week ago, his came from an Instagram ad and came with instructions, they were supposed to be washed with saltwater to be reused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think I read on Amazon maybe, that to remove something like the toothpaste, you twist it, not pull it straight out away from the wall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use a bit of this to hold a couple of plectrums to the body of my guitar. It picks up so much dust I have to wash it every few weeks just to hold a 1gram piece of plastic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it looks like the adhesive power of these strips is tied to how porous the thing you are attaching them to is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wager the wife won&rsquo;t be happy when she gets back home and see what you did to the walls and mirrors.  lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funny. tape C specifically has an image showing it can Non-slip a rug :P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amazon vendors don&rsquo;t have great products.  Did you test any directly from the mf website?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know no one who can snap fingers like you!!  Sheesh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the detailed review I must keep away from theses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew this looked familiar! But couldn&rsquo;t think of why until everything is started falling. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was on Vivian Tries I first saw this. You should have had a fake wall like she did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the brick test, the wall is extremely hot and in a very sunny place &hellip; try the brick test on shaded wall üòä</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one made me laugh. Lol. Thanks!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your bricks had a spacer on them three on each side. Those are what were holding the bring a pure flat brick may have worked better. just a thought</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is still very good tape, just not as &ldquo;Magical&rdquo; as they make it look.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üôå Thank you thank you thank you for a legit review!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your &ldquo;bricks&rdquo; are actually pavers. They have spacer ridges on the sides. Therefore, the tape is only adhering to those three or four narrow spacer ridges. If you had smooth-edged bricks, you may have gotten a different result. However, I really doubt the tape would hold up very long outdoors, especially in the hot sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that the same stuff used  in  - It&rsquo;s the Original Wacky Wally Wall Crawler?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thank it has a bit more &ldquo;Bite&rdquo;.. but,

<li>
<p>Used as a Makeup Rxtraster  responsible . It might pull it off. (no pun intended)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think they weren‚Äôt made to use in the LasVegas heat but is supposed to be used indoors. Most people don‚Äôt live in Vegas heat. To be fair test indoors. The heat is melting the tape. Not for use in Vegas because the heat melts the tape in a short time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait. So, do you brush your teeth with a razor or do you use toothpaste as shaving cream to shave? Which one is it?:p</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tried this on a picture to see what would happen. Held great. Removing picture - not so great took a chunk of plaster off, which took me ages to get of picture frame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, the $64,000 Question is, how did they do the test or rather, how did they fake the tests???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bricks had parts that stuck out.  If they were even that test may have worked better.  Also, maybe cleaning the bricks and cinder blocks with rubbing alcohol and allowing it to dry would improve the performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one thing I thought it would be good for was a rug as well, but as you tried yourself it didn&rsquo;t do well ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è weird</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like, does it expect you to use goo gone to get that crud off or something?  The &ldquo;good ole fashioned&rdquo; vinegar that&rsquo;s secretly the best way to get gunk from things like fly traps off things..?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try putting the tape on the floor first then put the rugs on them, maybe the result would be different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are probably right about facebook venders buying cheap from alibababababa and reselling.  It&rsquo;s the advice they got form those ads that constantly interrupt youtube videos, make $10,000 a month using online selling techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy I can finally hang my toothpaste to the mirror</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey I love your videos, but one thing that has always bother me is that when you &ldquo;on the commercial they showed blah blah&rdquo; I always have to go and look for the video myself to get context since where I live we don&rsquo;t have that as seen on TV stuff. Would be nice if you could put a clip of what you&rsquo;re talking about for context. Anyway love the videos man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont know what you did wrong with the wash and reuse, but another youtuber did that and rehung a brick and stacked a 40 lb weight on it. It did fall after the weight was put on it but it took a few seconds at least.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i subscribed when the dial fell off the wall. nice job!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how the hell do you keep your mirror so clean after so many days i cant even keep my mirror clean for more than a day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where I live you can&rsquo;t put nails in the walls. I wish I had saw your video before I brought 2 rolls of this crap! Could have saved my money. Thx for your video new subscriber</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did he use soap when he washed and reused? I ask because I&rsquo;ve used reusable adhesive products that require washing before reuse, and they worked, but only if they were washed with soap. (They weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;nanotape&rdquo;, though. They were car dashboard-mounted cellphone holders, but they did work well for reuse after soapy washing, but not with just water.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The material reminds me of the washable lint roller things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glad I watched this. Saved some money. Thank You!</p>
</li>

<p>I got a youtube ad for it yesterday that was absurd. I can&rsquo;t find the video anywhere. The video involved a large brick being taped to a wall. Than another brick being taped to it, and a third brick being taped to it. They were a little smaller than cinder blocks, but solid. Horizontally sticking out from a wall&hellip; when a man stood on the makeshift platform and demonstrated that it could support his weight. 3 pieces of tape, 3 blocks, one wall.

<p>damn i just bought these now having missed ur video before buying :( fell for the fake ads on insta :( thanks for ripping them apart tho</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the temp out and the temp of the wall. Heat will have a lot to do with how it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lovely dog on that picture frame though!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You look like the coolest dad! And I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I appreciate you taking out the time to address the public with these advertisements you did a great job</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm in a dorm with painted cinder blocks. I might use that to hang decor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thank you so much for this review. it stopped me from wasting money on this stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That stuff is as reusable as condoms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sheetrock wasn&rsquo;t prepared properly for painting, that&rsquo;s why the latex pulled off in chunks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there&rsquo;s particles, like dust sand and dirt, adhesives stick to that, and that means the adhesive isn&rsquo;t stuck fully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that the same stuff used  in  - It&rsquo;s the Original Wacky Wally Wall Crawler?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thank it has a bit more &ldquo;Bite&rdquo;.. but,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used as a Makeup Rxtraster. It might pull it off. (no pun intended)</p>

<p>I bought 4 rolls of that junk.  It is NOT for permanent adhesion. and you must wet it and stick to both surfaces wet and it last like a day. I use it to pin papers in my home office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James what about kids products!!! Toothbrushes, pillows, nightlights, those suction cup bowls, etc&hellip; think that would be pretty cool to see and maybe Bailey could get some new toys lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gorilla makes a similar double-sided tape, however, it&rsquo;s not reusable or easily removable, almost like super glue.

<li>
<p>Reusable is one of those things they put on the box to sound nice I swear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this different from &ldquo;Acrylic Foam Tape&rdquo;? It looks similar and seems as-strong, but the makers don&rsquo;t advertise re-usability with those.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as I saw it rip the paint of your walls I decided that&rsquo;s a huge NOPE from me, it would stink to have to repaint your room just because you wanted to put up a portrait with these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>picture frame&hellip; I think they stick it on something more durable on the frame&hellip;  Awesome tests&hellip; regardless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your time and effort &hellip; I will definitely not order them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Than you for this experiences, they had helped me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice funny into üòÇ great vid man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now to go watch project farm and find out which double sided tape is the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great job.  Not wasting money on this !  Thanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems like it‚Äôs more automotive interior mounting tape, ie dash cameras, subwoofer controls, and the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOLOLOL! It stuck together! Hilarious!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude, you would be awesome in those infomercials grunting and struggling with some mundane product.</p>
</li>
