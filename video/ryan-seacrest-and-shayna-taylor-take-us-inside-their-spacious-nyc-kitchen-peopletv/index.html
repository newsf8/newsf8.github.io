<li>
<p>I have never seen a couple with less chemistry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some reason, they don&rsquo;t strike me as a couple. Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way in hell they sleep in the same bed. I&rsquo;d bet my life on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They act like legitimate roommates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Ryan is still trying to prove to us that he’s straight with this young beard he’s probably paying 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they didnt touch each other once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretty sure this is a PR romance cuz he&rsquo;s in the closet&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks like Brooke Shields..younger version..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of these days&hellip; Ryan will come out of the closet!! Just wait, sit and relax!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18 yr age difference.  He seems difficult to me.  He could never be with someone his own age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought that he was Gay&hellip;.wow. !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see them together. She seems so much younger than him. They seem like friends, to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That must be his roommate&hellip; lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is so tiny compared to her its like big sister little brother😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The question you always have to ask is &hellip; would she give him a second of her time if he was a middle class school teacher?  Answer:  nope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is a beautiful “ beard”   He is definitely Gay &hellip;. poor Ryan.  Needs to be in the glass closet cause he will never come out. It’s too late.  He hide it for so long.  Oh well it is what it is.   Be well &amp; happy new year  ..🎊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks like a visitor who has no say in that dull masculine decor.  Ryan has taken forever to settle down.  She&rsquo;s an arm piece.  No chemistry here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan Seacrest makes Richard Simmons look straight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She acts and sounds like a robot straight face very strange 🤔

</li>
<li>
<p>why do they both look awkward? they not acting like a couple would act in their home. its like his home and she is visiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg how much she got pay for play this?????🤔Ryan nobody believe this😪</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome place you got, happy for your success, I must say when I read the comments written, it seriously show&rsquo;s how miserable some people must be, to write the judgemental comments they have, nothing this guy does or says goes without being judged in the most close minded way, full of hate. So what if his gay, bi or straight or this is a roommate, or his partner, this is his life,and he can do whatever the F he wants,and live it the way he desires.. More you trash talk him, more he lives a more exciting life than any of the miserable people who trash talk him&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don’t look like they sleep together&hellip;my observation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg. She is so vanilla. When a dehydrator is the excitement of your life as a couple listening to spa music &hellip; I&rsquo;d hang myself 🤦‍♀️😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are they a real couple?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They look ridiculous as a couple. She&rsquo;s stunningly young &amp;  beautiful.  Ryan looks like an older gay uncle trying to be cool. . What could she possibly be doing with him ?? Don&rsquo;t suppose it has anything to do with his enormous wealth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh! They are couple! Wowsers..!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So strange he looks at her when she&rsquo;s talking like she&rsquo;s a stranger. Theres is no familiarity between them. Almost an awkwardness about them together. Her body is constantly leaning away from him. They do not seem like a couple at all to me..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People just feel that Ryan is not being himself. He&rsquo;ll be a lot happier if he comes out the closet. He can still have girls as friends.he&rsquo;s been around long enough, gay radars spotted him a long time ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a cover up..he likes men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And we wonder why there is so much hate in the world &hellip; all these nasty comments are simply made from &ldquo;judging a book by its cover&rdquo;. Wow people, change your heart and you can change the world. ♡</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kitchen is super clean&hellip;.. like no one has ever used it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The refrigerator door apparently weighs more than Ryan&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought this was his sister.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So much hate out there?? Jealous jerks all of you.. they haven’t done a damn thing wrong to any of you people.. grow up!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s never gonna marry her. Oddly every woman he does date, eventually marries their beloved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait are they a couple? I always thought he was homosexual and this woman looks transgender? Perhaps they are just roommates? Anyways beautiful kitchen!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its cute how she is saying ours and am  like mmmmh it&rsquo;s all Ryan&rsquo;s lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan Seacrest is straight!!!! 😱😳

<li></li>
<li>
<p>I’m shocked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His beard is so pretty. 🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan is a dweeb.  How did he get where he is????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought he was gay&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was there for an interview w Ryan or she was his co-host&hellip; not his partner&hellip; come out already</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s so little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so out of Ryan Seacrest news - when did he get a live-in gf?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YIKES,,,Lived with a healthy crazy obsession person drove me nuts ! I would drive to nearest fast food and gulf down a burger 🍔 in parking lot ,,, Moved on Thank God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow even when he&rsquo;s relaxing he&rsquo;s working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why isn’t he married. Before I heard of him having girlfriends, I thought he was gay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a lovely non-couple!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she is so much taller than him omg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NO CHEMISTRY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No love there!!! Sorry Ryan&hellip;..Nothing!!!! People can see it!!! Hope you find the right one😂😂😂She&rsquo;s not the one for you!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video of him and his girlfriend Shayna was literally uncomfortable viewing. She looks like a hostage.. 😂 They have a really awkward chemistry.. I’m not surprised they have broken up a couple of times.. Wishing 5hem the best this time..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really 🥳 <a href="https://youtu.be/ELogUDlBXfQ">https://youtu.be/ELogUDlBXfQ</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how people say u r miserable when u state the obvious. Ryan looked at kelly Ripa&rsquo;s oldest son with more lust and desire.. He looks at this chick like &ldquo;hey buddy&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks more like her father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seacrest looks like her Little brother&hellip;. ZERO CHEMISTRY!!

<p>Cute couple!💕 Cute doggies!!!🐾💙🐾🐩 Especially Panda!🎊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is everyone so negative? are they supposed to make out on the counter to seem more like a couple?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ewe she was in second grade when he was 35. That&rsquo;s so gross. And it&rsquo;s funny that they call themselves a family when they&rsquo;res just the 2 of them. Last time I checked They&rsquo;re an unmarried couple with no children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buddha fingers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shocked I thought he was gay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did I think he was gay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE Ryan Secrest! In my opinion, he’s a young Johnny Carson. He’s smart, witty and like what he has to say. I don’t think he’s gay at all. I think he’s picky and has a case of the professional Bachelor syndrome lol. This new relationship however, I agree with others that the chemistry is weird and it seems off. Shes way too young. I see him with someone a little older, beautiful, sophisticated and STRONG ✌🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To have money like this to have a kitchen in N.Y.C&hellip;BRAVO!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🙂🥦👄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cute same-sex couple!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I think Ryan is the bottom 🍑</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not buying it&hellip;

<p>Cool pad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People&hellip; if and I mean if he is gay So What. If they are roommates, SO WHAT!!!! There are more oppressing things/ people we should be more concerned for out there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>umm.. ok&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They broke up last week. Wonder who got what dog&hellip;&amp; dehydrator&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cringe&hellip;.🙈😬</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So f**** fake it makes me sick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she is clearly his personal chef &mdash; not romantic partner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>typical dime a dozen clout chaser who doesn&rsquo;t care about him sexually assaulting woman .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SO GAD PLAYCS OUR ANY ONE .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan&hellip; Shayna does not love you!  Sorry, I feel it, I am a psychic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do the spa music too:) I love you 2:) Marry her Ryan she&rsquo;s amazing:) and gorgeous too:)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of these things are gay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan seems so strange very robotic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just so u guys know at People.com when u go on your website thru Facebook you get one of those blinking things saying you won money which is basically a virus I&rsquo;m assuming or something not good for our phones. It won&rsquo;t let u on the page for more than a min before it pops up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought he was gay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here we are in mid March &amp; the comments abt the chemistry have proven phrophetic. I&rsquo;m sure she called it off. It was like a watered down Rachel Ray segment. PDA was zero. Perhaps the harrassment alligations were the beginning of the end. Sorry Ryan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is taller than he is (weird )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would people bother watching the video if your going to criticize them. Who cares about the age difference. Their happy. They have earned this lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake news&hellip;Fake girlfriend. 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Couple? Hmmmmmmmm? NOT!

<p>Why do rich people always have to show off what they have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She lacks substance. He can do better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s annoying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seacrest = creep yyyy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, what a bunch of nasty comments people!  I think Ryan and Shayna are a beautiful couple. And I would like to thank you Ryan for the joy you bring to my mother every week day on &ldquo;Live with Kelley and Ryan&rdquo;. She is bedridden and doesn&rsquo;t have much to look forward to, but she will not miss your show. She laughs so much at the two of you. Thanks again!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe he just doesn&rsquo;t want t to be gay anymore , he met her&amp; he&rsquo;s happy, she&rsquo;s not as tall as people think , she has 5 ins heels on he&rsquo;s a super nice guy &amp; very rich but very generous too leave him alone stop playing guessing game&rsquo;s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In comments concerning the video. Is it just me or dont u think it maybe weird living with Ryan Seacrest.. I dunno of I could be with a dude that dresses better than I do and probably wears as much makeup. I have a feeling he could be hard to deal with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bhg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kitchen spotless but I bet there is dog hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont think their married. Ryan is scared of commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That fruit that looks like a lemon with fingers is called Buddha&rsquo;s hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know the popular thing is to say Ryan is gay but why in almost 2019 would he hide in the closet ? He&rsquo;s worth almost $400 million dollars, none of his jobs require him to be a &ldquo;ladies man&rdquo; type, no one would really care if he came out meaning he wouldn&rsquo;t lose any fans. I know many &ldquo;stars&rdquo;, athletes and politicians are closeted but I just don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan, do you ever tire of how hard you work covering? Look, I don&rsquo;t care who you love, and you&rsquo;d be surprised at the love and acceptance others would give you, but this video is such a waste of your energy trying too hard pretending. Just note that living fraudulently always will come back 10 fold, and you deserve the best life you can. You chose the spotlight, but that comes with it a responsibility to be true. I hope the best for you, and I hope this doesn&rsquo;t bite you back too hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan is the ultimate metrosexual.  He needs to get back to basics at Lake Lanier and go fishing with Jimmy Houston.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video is like making a commercial.  He is definitely a gay man and lives in a denial world. On the other hand, he never and ever talks about his dating life. It seems he has no feeling about woman. His co-star, Kelly Ripa who is a big time supporter of LGBT.  I am sure she is aware of him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How has the Food Network not given Shayna her own show yet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake&hellip;Fake&hellip; Fake&hellip;Fake&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny when people we are mis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they just break up? No surprise&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haha&hellip;the comments are halirious. Ryan has always been a ladies man but he isnt into major PDA. I kinda think it would be weird for him to be all over her as she&rsquo;s talking about their food dehydrator. Idk&hellip;they dont strike me as a creepy couple. Just not super touchy during this segment.

<li>
<p>Cute together. Nice to have your man in the kitchen and he already knows what to do, 😉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No he is not gay he&rsquo;d dated the little blonde girl from dancing with stars for quite a long time  a couple of years ago</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News just in&hellip;Ryan &amp; she just split up. Shayna wanted to marry ,he was not ready. I don’t think he ever will, not to a woman that is. But I love him still.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan goes along way to try to convince people he is straight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cares&hellip;fake&hellip;fabricated&hellip;shallow&hellip;self indulgent! I guess he is in favor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did it ever occur to anyone that she is not comfortable being on camera&hellip;..we all know he is&hellip;..listen people&hellip;..my husband is shorter than me&hellip;.neither of us is gay&hellip;.stop judging&hellip;.let the man live his life and FYI&hellip;..I&rsquo;ve read that most people in NYC live in spaces that would fit in their kitchen so, not a bad score. Only person that has to answer for his decisions lives between his two elbows. The man has money&hellip;..she just might be an opportunist&hellip;.what if she is&hellip;..that would be his problem now wouldn&rsquo;t it? Good luck to you both Ryan&hellip;.I wish you both happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last time I remembered he was gay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOW This is a Fake couple🙄🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come on out of the closet Ryan we all know your gay it&rsquo;s ok buddy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have to much money!  that is what is wrong w/the world - greedy people&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly thought Ryan was gay. Even the most beautiful girl beside him just doesn’t seem compatible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not buying this relationship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My kitchen is way better than that and I live in rural America</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The comments about Ryan being gay, are so unkind!! If&hellip;.he is, maybe, just maybe, he&rsquo;s NOT comfortable admitting that. I found out at age 33, that I have a learning disability which made keeping a job, difficult. This discovery was made after I maintained an &ldquo;A-&rdquo; G.P.A., in College. At age 40, I started collecting SSI &amp; SSDI, after making SURE(as best I could)I would NEVER collect Government Handouts. I outlined all that to say, despite an individual&rsquo;s best plans, life can STILL&hellip; slap him or her in the face or punch &lsquo;em in the GUT, when you LEAST expect it!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s like 17 years older than her 🙄 Ryan can’t you find a nice 35 or 40 year old that you would have something in common with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan&rsquo;s not gay?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I had the money he has, I too would have all this.  It&rsquo;s so bloody annoying when rich people behave like this is how everyone should live.  Such arrogance.</p>
