<ul>
<li>
<p>i could never imagine how she is feeling loosing a daughter for had such a promising future and on top of that, her husband. she is now a single mom. if i cried i could not imagine her pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is unbelievably strong to even put anything out after such a loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How on earth can she even face the world , I don‚Äôt know how I would go on with life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think of the others souls too&hellip;rip to everyone involved who lost their lives that day!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We didn‚Äôt need this update. Let her and her family mourn in peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sucks that the 7 month old baby won‚Äôt remember that much of there father or big sister:(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Breaks her silence&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>As if y&rsquo;all haven&rsquo;t been reporting on her nonstop for the last 3 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She literally had no choice, people talking about this non-stop not even giving her time to grieve. Ridiculous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Breaks silent&rdquo;? Why is she supposed to say anything?! Let the woman grieve for goodness sakeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚Äú breaks her silence‚Äù? It has only been a couple of days! Give the family a break. I hate the press!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;breaks her silence&rdquo;? That feels like a bad choice of words. How about something neutral like &ldquo;Venessa responds to the outpouring of support&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Breaks her silence&rdquo; implies that she was withholding something from you. She doesn&rsquo;t owe any of us a damn thing, the media least of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has been 5 months since i lost my baby sister. She was 6 years younger than me and she looked up to me. She was only 23 years old when she died. Her death made me understand what grief is. She is the closest person I have ever lost. I cannot imagine what Kobe&rsquo;s family is going through and the families of those other people who were on the plane. This pain never goes away, you just learn how to live with it. Five months later and I still analyze my sisters death and her last week alive. I think it will be like 10 years before my life goes back to normal again. Losing more than one family member at a time must be very devastating. I feel so sorry for Vanessa and her daughters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THIS REALLY HURTS..I HAVE BEEN SAD ALL WEEK AND DON&rsquo;T EVEN KNOW THEM AND CRIED.. SO I CAN&rsquo;T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE HOW SHE MUST BE FEELING&hellip;üò≠üò≠üíîüíîüíî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old school days yelling ‚ÄúKOBE!‚Äù Every time you threw something in the bucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every picture he&rsquo;s with his family his smile is ear to ear

<p>People need to give her time to grieve. She has three other daughters that are 100% broken after this tragedy. So give her time to be there for her family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May they all Rest In Peace üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ swear I just lost my aunt this month on the 16th my mom had so much going on around New Years surgery a lot of complications going on this year and we are still in the first month!! May god be with those left behind after losing loved ones&hellip; man it‚Äôs like the things that happen especially this situation make you question a lot it really does but ppl say time heals yea for some&hellip; for me it‚Äôs just as sad and fresh as the day I lost my aunt i pray they can come to and reconcile with this and move on.. not move on and forget but move on and continue to remember them in the way they would want to be remembered in&hellip; Rest In Peace to the all involved againüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòá üòá heaven gained 9 angels&hellip; god has a plan is what I like to believe.. GONE BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN and this is for any body who lost some body they may be gone but memories last for ever..üíØüíØ cherish the time YOU and the LOVED ones you have cherish it&hellip;tomorrow isn‚Äôt promised to NOBODY love all man love all I‚Äôm still in shock still am&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP to the greatest basketball legend Kobe Bryant and to his daughter. Much love to the rest of his family. May the one above show the family much love. God bless üôè üôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Makes me sad famous people can‚Äôt grieve privately and feel obligated to speak about it so quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m still hurt about it and I think I will continue to be , but I can&rsquo;t even imagine what she&rsquo;s going through and my heart goes out to her  and all of the victims families, r.i.p kobe,gigi, and the 7 other victims üïäü•Äüíû</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This still don‚Äôt seem real, such a tragedy, such a loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine just having lost a husband and daughter and in less than a week the press is asking how you‚Äôre doing.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>To be able to stand that, she‚Äôs probably one of the strongest woman I‚Äôve seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as kobe said &ldquo;It takes a king to make a princess&rdquo;:(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear this family looks so happy in those pictures. Why do these things happen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At times like this I wish TMZ, entertainment tonight, and all these shows did not exist. They pry way too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement should not be expected from her yet, Jesus just let her grieve in privacy&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I  ant imagine how she feels it must be so painful to lose your daughter and your husband to they died way to early and they were way to young to die R.I.P kobie and Gigi. To the rest of the people that dies in the helicopter crash may they Rest In Peace to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was an absolutely beautiful statement. My heart goes out to all the families impacted by this tragedy. With lifted arms, I pray for you all. üôåüèΩ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine his 2nd daughter as &ldquo;like a tornado&rdquo; when he described her&hellip;üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry for their loss, his legacy will be remembered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs so sad because Gianna hasn‚Äôt even lived her life yet, she was only 13üò≠üíî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobes fans sound more depressed than vanessa but I understand because now the mansions are to her name so are the cars and other properties she can sell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for sharing. That was so beautiful.  They will be miss forever in our hearts. My prays goes to family and friends to all nine victims that was in the plane crashüòîüôèüíîüò≠

</li>
<li>
<p>So dam sad. Hes my age&hellip; I&rsquo;m inspired by this mans love and lack of selfishness throughout his journey. He&rsquo;s one of a kind. I can imagine the pain this family feels. Breaks my MF heart. Smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes this tragic, is because Kobe is still at the prime of his life, and Gianna is just at the beginning of hers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people in the comments think they have a right to take some responsibility in telling others. Let&rsquo;s do this and that or assuming they know what those people are going through. You dont.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless all the families who lost their loved ones.. I lost my sweet husband of 27 years..to a heart attack in May 2019. Father to our 2 son&rsquo;s.. Loss is the most difficult part of life. God and lots of prayers keep us going the best we can. Prayers always for healing.</p>

<li>
<p>Rip Gigi: 2006-2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the 7 others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This may be the number one topic for the rest of the year. RIP to Kobe, his daughter and all the other personnel on that chopper because Kobe wasn‚Äôt the only one on it. Life is to short. üòø</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i just get the chills thinking about how vanessa is feeling right now .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just wish that the plane had a working operating system to which could prevent the helicopter from going down. But to all 9 people on that helicopter, may you rest in peace‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòîüòîüòîüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ. Prayers to all families who lost their loved ones.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs sooo sad that their 7 month old daughter will NOT remember her dad at allüò≠ it‚Äôs so heartbreaking! She won‚Äôt ever get to see his beautiful smile in person üò≠üò≠üíì</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the thing that I never see losting a husband and a daughter in the same day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it really sad that you can imagine. I feel very sad for the rest of his family because I know that it&rsquo;s not that  easy to lost someone in the family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope Vanessa will stray strong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Condolences to the families, of the love ones lost, in this very tragic accident.R.I.P üôèüíöüíõ‚ù§üíê</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is absolutely heartbreaking.  I am praying for the entire Bryant family and all of the other passengers/pilots who died in that crash. Because their lives were just as important, just not worldwide known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Happend in the world Kobe die flood in indonesia Fire in Australiaüò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I couldn‚Äôt imagine losing a child. Children are suppose to bury their parents, not the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you&hellip; Kobe Bryant for giving you moments of joy that we will never forget you rest in peace, you and your daughter Gigi Bryant. God have you in his holy glory&hellip; Thanks Kobe Bryant .. RIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry for the loss of Kobe &amp; Gianna.üå∑I can&rsquo;t imagine Vanessa&rsquo;s pain, but I&rsquo;m praying that the Lord will help her, &amp; give her strength &amp; peace to endure for their lovely dgts.üíùAlso pray for their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is such a tremendous desparity in the apportionment of thought that goes into the death of individuals. I mean, if someone dies in a mass shooting or terrorist attack, they have more attention. If they&rsquo;re famous (obviously), they&rsquo;ll have more support allocated to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What an irreplaceable loss . It‚Äôs heartbreaking and very tragic. So hard to loose a child along with the Father. May God give Vanessa strength to move forward and may peace be with the rest of the family. RIP all star</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praying for The Bryant family and all of the other families.</p>

<p>I was saddened when I heard of every one of their deaths that died in that tragedy and hope God brings comfort to everyone&rsquo;s family that lost someone in that crash in Jesus name. It also brings to mind that whoever it is that lives on this planet that&rsquo;s human is not exempt from death weather- rich or poor , male or female , famous or not famous we will all answer to God and the only way to be forgiven is to give your life to Jesus the Son of God that&rsquo;s what will guarantee our salvation and it starts with a prayer of you telling God you receive Jesus as your Lord and savior and confess that yes you have committed sins and you do need God : You know regularly speak to God and speak from your heart and He&rsquo;s listening I say this because there are people who don&rsquo;t know that or they have heard it but need to hear it again all I know is that if you give your heart to Jesus you won&rsquo;t regret it.( You don&rsquo;t have anything to loose only something to gain)</p>

<p>God bless you kobe and your beautiful daughter may rest in peace will miss you ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims family. I admire her strength to think of the others who lost thire lives and thire families grief. To set up a found for them so generous and thoughtful, because she know her and her children will never go without financially. The families of the other victims may not as financially stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanessa is a dear woman. I love how she&rsquo;s making sure a foundation is set up for the other families also to help them financially as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pray she becomes the coach for the Mamba team when everything is more settled. To me, Kobe and her daughter Gianna would want her to do that.</p>

<p>title was so weird, &ldquo;breaking silence&rdquo; I dont think anyone is in mood to talk when world turns upside down for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True legends live a short life, but touch millions of people&rsquo;s hearts.  His legacy will live on for eternity.  RIP G.O.A.T</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My thoughts and prayers go out to Vanessa and her children it is unimaginable to lose both your husband and child within an instance. I know Vanessa and her children will never get past this but i hope they will find the strength to move forward and laugh at the memories that they have of Kobe and Giana. Although Time does make it better the scar is left behind and will continue to be their until the day you die. The impact that Kobe had on the NBA was insane and I truly believe we won‚Äôt see anything like it again, besides the impact and legacy he left on the court he also made an impact on kids around the world. He was a huge role model for the younger generation and will continue to be for upcoming generations. Although we are feeling sad we should be happy knowing that he is in a better place now. This tragedy will take a while to sink in. As of his daughter passing with him as well makes the tragedy way worse. I can‚Äôt even imagine how Kobe felt when he knew that his life was about to end as well as his daughter and he couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. This tragedy goes to prove that tomorrow is never promised and death can happen at any second, so if you haven‚Äôt told a loved one that you love them today then please do because you just don‚Äôt know if they could be gone the next day. Kobe &amp; Gianna as well as the 7 other people on board along with their families will forever be in our hearts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so sorry for the families that lost their loved ones. I‚Äôm praying for their healing. üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I definitely am not a sportsfan but er body knows Kobe. This hurts my heart üò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm still struggling! I can‚Äôt imagine . Don‚Äôt want too. Please give these families a chance to grieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My deepest condolences, prayers! Love too the families!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really respect Kobe for his service to, and compassion for, others. I am a big believer in the notion that when you&rsquo;re in the public eye, as he was, you should use that celebrity status to do good, and to set a good example for the many who look up to you. I feel that when you&rsquo;ve been blessed in your life, you should &ldquo;pass it on&rdquo;, so to speak, in whatever ways you can, and Kobe did that. Having made the world a better place is about the best thing anyone can achieve, and about the best thing that could be said of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selfless in the middle of heart break she still took the time out to tell everyone to support and donate to the other families that was part of the tragic accident&hellip; Very Sweet Vanessa&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truly sad every time I see this story I&rsquo;m almost in tears..praying first the family and friends</p>

<p>Beautiful full of love A photo that conveys how happy their past days in the family have been. A prayer for those who are now born in heaven.</p>
</li>

<p>If fan like you and me are hurt and some cried over his death, imagine how she is feeling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comforting to know that Gigi and Kobe are together right now.., ‚ù§Ô∏è still so heartbreaking for Vanessa and the girls. I hope they find the strength to pull through üôè</p>

<li>
<p>Life is just not fair sometimes. My heart breaks for these families. üíî</p>
</li>

<p>Imagine that one family that lose both parents and the daughter. :(</p>

<p>Guys, Enjoy life before it&rsquo;s to late, you never know what could happen it&rsquo;s sad man</p>

<p>This is reminding me of when cam died  and it&rsquo;s making me sad ü•∫üò≠</p>

<li>
<p>Kobe‚Äôs kids are always smiling, they were so happy around their dad. What a great dad, rip to all those lost in the accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine the hurt inside her heartüòì God Bless to the familyüôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I lost my dad, I could physically feel the fact that people were praying for me. I felt like something was holding me up during those first few weeks, when I couldn‚Äôt hold myself up. Please keep this family in your thoughts and prayers, it might be a small thing but I promise it does help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What an amazing family they were eh&hellip;must have had some fabulous &amp; loving times together but life goes on &amp; the family that is left will no dought stay tight, loving &amp; caring for each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine kobe and Gigi being in that chopper knowing what was coming, them probably holding each other in the last moments. A tragedy. Rip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üò≠she lost her daughter and husband in one day</p>
</li>

<p>Rip, they were gone too soonüòûüñ§ü§ßüòüüïäüôèüèæ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People need to stop being heartless bots. And get to know, that trauma and death is real and deeply felt. If you have never loved or missed a loved one whom passed recently. Then, i don&rsquo;t know if you ever known what family was like. Obviously. The family will be financially stabled. But it is not the greed they&rsquo;re after or wanting at this time of grief. You all, should be put on a pedestal and see, who wishes hate other than comfort. For a family who would miss a legend and a sister, who could have been the next Kobe bryant. Ps: if you can&rsquo;t sympathize over two lives gone. I don&rsquo;t know how you waste time trying to convince anyone you are any better. Grow up.</p>

<p>What a beautiful family he was blessed with! His wife and children are gorgeous. God blessed him with a talent that afforded him a great life and some say he didn&rsquo;t appreciate it! The truth will eventually come out as it always does but right now, he was a great basketball player with a lovely family who is grieving a heartbreaking loss.
