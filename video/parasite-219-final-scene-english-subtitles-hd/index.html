<li>
<p>the darkest part in the movie shot on a bright sunny day</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>the contrast ooof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we talk about the girl carrying the guy on piggy back after she found him? Like I don’t know why that makes me happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everything happened so fast also went into sad mode when jessica said it hurts :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>really sad when Jessica died. she was quite odd and didn&rsquo;t seem to care a lot. yet she was smart, had great ambitions and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>losing a family member like that must feel like a big loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poor dad has such great facial expressions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rich but still nice&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nice because they&rsquo;re rich&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This scene happened way too quick like you couldn&rsquo;t understand anything but the way it is stitched together was so perfect that you could perfectly comprehend and even memorize the sequence of the happenings in less than 5 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:54 respect to that one rich guy who tried to stop him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this movie gave me some weird and strong anxiety</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shot where we see the bread being stained by blood is a good representation of this scene. White is the colour of perfection, purity and innocence. We can compare the French bread to the Park’s. The film is not so much about the rich vs the poor but we find that it is actually the two poor families going against each other instead. The Park’s were completely oblivious to the Kim&rsquo;s malicious plan and the couple living in the basement they did not even know they had. We can see throughout the film that Mrs. Park is also very naive and kind, the Kim’s pointed this out in dialogue when Mr. Kim said “she’s rich, but still nice” which Mrs. Kim replies with “she’s nice because she’s rich.” The bread, or the Park’s being stained with blood is like they are no longer the pure and innocent people we thought they were. We see this when they were more concerned with their son having a seizure, than Jessica bleeding from her stab wound. It’s understandable that they would be more concerned with their son than the people they merely hired, but they did not show the slightest concern or worry to the others who were injured. The director did well showing that even the nice people who did no harm are also naturally selfish and only worry about themselves because they are also human.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legitimately the darkest moment of the movie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This scene was so chilling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Park: exists</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The guy from the basement: 5:19

<li>
<p>My god there’s even references to the Addam’s Family</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also props to the Mom for jumping into dual combat when she was called out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I watched this for the first time, the conclusion of the whole scene with Kim stabbing the rich dad felt like a huge pressure was just released.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The smell was a factor that had already been brought up before in the movie, but this was the final straw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After watching it a second time you realize these rich dad deserve death, he was so mean to the father. And he didn’t care at al that his daughter was dying at all he just wanted the keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spoiler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A masterpiece of a movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:22 true love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jessica&rsquo;s actor really made it sell like, Talking like she&rsquo;s out breath and saying it hurts and if the directors added her saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go&rdquo; i would have cried a little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey subtle detail i noticed:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the themes in this movie is while the rich can ignore other people&rsquo;s problems, they can&rsquo;t ignore violence and can never truly escape it. At 3:54 this guy takes a chair and attacks from the top, holding it up high, but is still stabbed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his girlfriend really did love him, carrying him on her back like that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sooo glad I watched this at 4am right before bed. I&rsquo;m not depressed at all. :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:43 her no reaction, reaction was amazing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This scene(Imo) has one of the best uses of the Kuleshov Effect(i.e intercutting a shot with another subject to show a progression of emotion or thought in the first subject)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shot 1, Mr. Kim, 5:27: Shows Kim&rsquo;s face with utter disgust and cringe at the dead body and a look at Mr. Park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intercut, Mr. Park, 5:29 : Mr. Park closing his nose to take the key, showing no sympathy or grief and not even a pinch of sadness. Just wants to take the key and considers the dead man as a disgusting obstacle.</p>
</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how people from opposing end of the socio-economic spectrum share the same dystopian fate while selfishness led them to their own demise.</p>

<p>I am a huge fan of Todd Phillips&rsquo; (and Joaquin Phoenix&rsquo;s performance) &ldquo;Joker&rdquo; so I wondered about the buzz around this movie (Parasite) and watched it with some skepticism.  Obviously, there is an underlying political message in this movie (between two Koreas), but the morality and human drama of the screenplay is undeniable.  This is a very good movie!</p>

<p>I don’t know why but that part makes me laugh. It’s just such a preposterous noise to make while you’re doing something so horrific</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choong-sook says about Kim: &ldquo;He&rsquo;d run and hide like a cockroach,&rdquo; while wondering how they would react if Park caught them. &ldquo;When you turn on the light, and the cockroaches scatter?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Watch 6:16 as the light in Kim&rsquo;s head goes on, he is out of there! Lol I love the foreshadowing in this film.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’’m scared</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guen-sae is the real victim in this movie, I think. Guen-sae tells Kim, &ldquo;In old age, LOVE will comfort me.&rdquo; Deep stuff if you knew what&rsquo;s being foreshadowed.</p>

<p>The letter Ki-woo writes is tragic, as he had the choice to do that, but instead picked the opposite and let himself become too greedy.</p>

<p>For those who dont know, basically the guy who was in the basement was the former landlord/house owner but was overwhelmed by debts/bills that he hid in the house (the bloody guy who smashed the kid with the rock). There are three families in this movie. Rich, poor, and off the grid. Off the grid was the couple living inside the basement/bunker of the house. When the rich family was gone, the poor family would eat and rest in the rich family’s house. But once, the otg (off the grid) family found them taking the rich familys food, using their stuff, etc. the wife of the otg tried to warn the rich family by going up the stairs, but the wife of the poor family kicked her down and she fell down the whole row of concrete stairs, suffering major head damage. The otg husband, was tied up and gagged so he wouldnt scream or yell or do anything to warn the rich family. The otg husband was forced to watch his wife die of brain damage because he was tied up, and when he finally got himself untied, he lured one of the poor or rich familys son into the bunker and smashed his head with a rock. It wasnt fatal because the rock was fake, and hollow. The reason his face was bloodied up at first was because when he was tied up he tried using morse code to flicker the lights into telling people his wife was dying. He failed, and was forced to wait. The otg husband goes out with a knife and stabs the poor familys daughter, and the little boy (the rich fmailys son) collapses. This is because the otg husband once tried to go out of the bunker, but the boy saw him and he had a seizure of fear. The rich family was rushing the rich son to the hospital, when the rich dad needed his keys. Despite the poor familys daughter literally bleeding to death, the fact that he pinched his nose as he got the keys from the otg husband, he was showing how he despised the poor. The poor familys husband, having enough, stabs the rich familys dad to teach him a lesson. The poor father, realizing what he has done, rushes to go to the bunker (scene fades to black) in the future the poor son gets into a good college, graduates, and buys the house for his own. From there on the poor dad and son are reunited again.

<p>Why did Kim kill Mr. Park? I dont get it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad about Mr Park. It wasn’t his fault peoples bad hygiene and having a sensitive nose. Not enough excuse to be murdered. But I think Mr Kim action was  because he had too much anger and confusion in his head, his children were dying, he lost his home and everything got out of control, and when he sees Park’s reaction it was like the cherry on the tope of the cake for him and took that decision as an stupid impulse he couldn’t control. Really fucked up tho. It proves to me that some people like to blame others for their misery/tragedies.</p>

<li>
<p>what genre would u even put this movie in? horror?😭🤷🏻‍♀️i dont know</p>

<p>Overall, I really liked the movie, but one thing I dont understand is that why the poor dad had to kill the rich dad. &ldquo;smell&rdquo; is not an enough excuse.</p>

<p>If those Kim family members possesed political power or wealth they would have turned out to be the real Kim family from NK. That&rsquo;s my view point from the movie. The rich are not always wrong and the poor are not always innocent. They even mentioned President Kim in a scene in that movie. Cause the Kim&rsquo;s possess every single attribute to become the Dictator family. Selfish, fraud, manipulators, killers and most importantly hypocrites.</p>

<p>5:42 why did he stab him? It&rsquo;s the only thing that I don&rsquo;t understand here

<p>I’m conflicted on this scene. I think it would’ve been more impactful if the keys landed underneath Kim’s daughter and me Parker did that face. Then I could see that pushing Kim off the edge and killing him. I know that the theme was Parkers distaste for the smell of poor people. However the guy had blood and meat stabbed into his insides. Of course he isn’t going to smell pleasant. Kim should have no attachment to that man. Also killing Parker just made things worse. The focus for Kim was saving his daughter and taking her to hospital. Killing Parker just shifted the focus and it was how do I get away? Plus Parker’s daughter never told the police detectives about the huge door next to Kevin’s bloody body?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RESPECT!</p>

<p>That scene, the &ldquo;What are you doing!&rdquo; shows how much the Rich Dad cared about the poor&rsquo;s problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait why did one of the guys with the cool indian hat kill the other someone explain to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I saw Mr. Kim with the Native American headdress on, he looked so much like an actual Native American that I looked up the origins of Native Americans.  Basically, they come from Mongolia.  So, even though they were here before the Europeans, America is not &ldquo;their land.&rdquo; They are also colonizers.</p>

<p>Whatever people says, for me Kims are to blame. You commit fraud, theft also a murder. Then  after you hear something bad about you in a situation  where your not supposed to be on the first place,  you again commit murder to your employer who unknowingly feeding your entire family. Wtf. I know that rich family couples are arrogent and two faced but still they didn’t cause any harm.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to me is the passivity of the women in this. Jessica is dying, but she is still vaguely interested in what is happening, ambivalent over her own death as she is to everything else in her life. Ms. Park sees her husband get murdered and is watching with a blank expression. Only Chung Sook, the most &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; of these women (being a former athlete and having a sturdier figure), reacts the way we are. The director, intentionally or not, has made an anti-sexist statement here: when women are feminized, they lose their soul and passion and vigor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This movie isn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok, but I really don’t think this should’ve beat endgame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second rate movie but hey not bad a solid B flick</p>
