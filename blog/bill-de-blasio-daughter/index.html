<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio defended his daughter on Monday following her arrest during weekend protests and insisted she didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;commit any violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chiara de Blasio, 25, was taken into custody late Saturday night at East 12th Street and Broadway in Manhattan for alleged unlawful assembly during protests against police brutality.</p>
<p>De Blasio said he didn&rsquo;t know his own daughter got arrested until a reporter called City Hall. &ldquo;The media knew about this before I did,&rdquo; he said.https://t.co/HDEA42NKV5 — NBC New York (@NBCNewYork) June 1, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust my daughter, I&rsquo;ve known her her her whole life. She&rsquo;s an incredibly good human being,&rdquo; de Blasio told reporters, while not offering specifics on the arrest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not someone who would ever commit any violence &hellip; she was very clear, she believes she was following the instructions of police officers and doing what they were asking. I&rsquo;m going to let her speak for herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor didn&rsquo;t discuss his daughter&rsquo;s arrest during various meetings with reporters on Sunday. De Blasio claimed that he and wife Chirlane McCray didn&rsquo;t learn about their daughter&rsquo;s arrest immediately.</p>

<p>Protesters, decrying the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis last week, were staged across the nation this past weekend. The neighborhoods around Union Square in Manhattan and the Barclays Center in Brooklyn were among protest hot spots in New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If had know that my daughter was arrested I would have been the first to let the public know,&rdquo; de Blasio said. &ldquo;I have a 25-year-old adult daughter who lives her own life. She chooses to share information with me if she deems to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Blasio said he didn&rsquo;t find out about the arrest until reporters peppered his office with questions about it on Sunday. &ldquo;The media knew about this before I knew about it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>An image of Chiara de Blasio&rsquo;s arrest report, which included her home address and ID number, was tweeted out by the Sergeants Benevolent Association, a NYPD union that has been a constant critic of de Blasio.</p>
<p>That tweet has since been taken down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SBA did something unconscionable and it&rsquo;s not just because it&rsquo;s my daughter,&rdquo; de Blasio said. &ldquo;They do this all the time with peoples&rsquo; privacy.&rdquo;

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio&rsquo;s 25-year-old daughter was arrested for unlawful assembly Saturday night, according to the city&rsquo;s Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information. Chiara de Blasio was at a protest in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>The New York Post obtained an arrest report saying she refused to leave a Manhattan street that officers ordered cleared because people were throwing things.</p>
<p>Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn&rsquo;t mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing.</p>
<p>It was one of hundreds of arrests at protests in the city over the weekend, CBS New York reports.</p>
<p>The demonstration Chiara attended was among countless ones around the country over the fatal arrest of George Floyd.</p>
<p>While many other cities have imposed curfews in response to protests, Bill de Blasio has insisted New York doesn&rsquo;t need one.</p>
<p>At the press briefing, De Blasio praised police for showing &ldquo;restraint&rdquo; Saturday evening. But he also criticized the actions of some officers he said showed &ldquo;a callous disregard for fellow New Yorkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like what I saw one bit. I never want to see something like that. I don&rsquo;t want to see anything like that again. We need to do a full investigation and look at the actions of those officers and see what was done, why it was done, how it could&rsquo;ve been done differently,&rdquo; the mayor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I also want to emphasize that situation was created by a group of protesters blocking and surrounding a police vehicle, a tactic that we had seen before in the last few days, a tactic that can be very very dangerous to everyone involved. And we&rsquo;ve seen direct attacks on police officers, including in their vehicles.&rdquo;</p>

Chiara de Blasio, the 25-year-old daughter of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Bill de BlasioScience says: &lsquo;Open the schools&rsquo; De Blasio&rsquo;s daughter arrested in NYC protest: reports &lsquo;Mr. President, the nation needs to hear from you&rsquo; MORE (D), was arrested during a protest in the city over the weekend, according to local reports.</p>
<p>The New York Post and WABC, both citing local law enforcement sources, reported on Sunday that the mayor’s daughter was arrested for unlawful assembly the night before. She was allegedly arrested after she and other protesters refused to unblock a street in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The demonstration on late Saturday came as the city entered a third day of protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week shortly after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>According to The New York Times, hundreds of people have been arrested following a string of demonstrations in the region, some of which involved looting and arson.</p>
<p>Shortly after his daughter was arrested, Bill de Blasio reportedly called for protesters “to go home” during a press conference on late Saturday.</p>
<p>“We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but now it is time for people to go home. &hellip; If you went out peacefully to make a point about the need for change, you have been heard and change is coming in the city. I have no doubt about that. It’s time to go home so we can all move forward,” he said then, according to the Post.</p>
<p>He also reportedly took aim at some protesters he said have an “explicit agenda of violence” in remarks on Sunday, the paper reported.</p>
<p>“It is a small number of people. It is well organized, even though many of the people are associated with the anarchist movement,” he said earlier.

<p>NEW YORK (WABC) &ndash; Mayor Bill de Blasio&rsquo;s daughter, Chiara, was among the 345 protesters arrested Saturday night.Chiara de Blasio was arrested about 10:30 p.m. Saturday for unlawful assembly.The 25-year-old was one of about 100 people who refused to leave the roadway when advised by police.She was given a desk appearance ticket.The mayor spoke about his daughter&rsquo;s arrest Monday morning saying, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s 25 years old she did not inform Chirlane and I of her intention to get arrested.&ldquo;Her father said he didn&rsquo;t learn of her arrest until media reports emerged Sunday. He said his daughter told him she didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.&ldquo;She was very clear that she believed she was following the instructions of police officers and doing what they were asking&hellip; absolutely, she was abundantly clear she was peacefully protesting, not doing anything that would provoke a negative response,&rdquo; he said at a media briefing, adding that he admired her for peacefully &ldquo;trying to change something that she thought was unjust.&ldquo;Although the arrest was a shock to Mayor de Blasio and his wife, &ldquo;I want to tell her how much I love and respect and admire her.&ldquo;When asked by Eyewitness News if he thought his daughter did anything wrong, the mayor said emphatically, &ldquo;No.&ldquo;Largely peaceful George Floyd protests around the city on Saturday gave way to scattered clashes between police and protesters later in the evening.Demonstrators smashed shop windows, threw objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads.The mayor blamed much of the violence on a small group of well-organized &ldquo;anarchists.&ldquo;PHOTOS: George Floyd protests erupt into violence in NYC &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
