<h3 id="how-kerala-flattened-the-curve-lowest-death-rates-health-minister-shailaja-explains">&ldquo;How Kerala flattened the curve, lowest death rates: Health minister Shailaja explains&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-au7mok02br0m258dgrfuqgmvt0-20200525112027.Medi.jpeg" alt="img">
Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala’s health minister K.K. Shailaja, popularly known as Teacher, received worldwide acclaim for her handling of the Covid-19 suituation. Under her leadership, Kerala succeeded in flattening the curve and registering perhaps the lowest death rate in the world besides a very high recovery rate.</p>
<p>The 63-year-old minister has no time to sit on her laurels as she prepares to meet the fresh challenge posed by the recent spike in Covid-19 cases the lifting of travel restrictions.</p>
<p>In this exclusive interview with Gilverter Assary, Dr Shailaja shares her success mantra, how her granddaughters miss her and how her experience of teaching Marxian philosophy, dialectics of materialism and her curiosity to understand medical science terms have helped her tackle difficult situations with ease. Excerpts:</p>
<p>Q: How prepared are you to tackle the spike in Covid-19 cases?</p>
<p>Our effort is to flatten the curve. We had anticipated this situation. Because of timely measures we could tackle the three cases from Wuhan successfully, by not allowing any spread. Then came a couple from Italy which jumped quarantine norms, resulting in contact cases. Till the second phase we had 70 per cent imported cases and 10 per cent contact cases. Through effective quarantine measures, we succeeded in flattening the curve.</p>
<p>Most significantly we succeeded in keeping the death rate very low. Of the 512 cases in the initial two phases, only three deaths have occurred. All others have recovered.</p>
<p>Q. What is behind the success of the Kerala model?</p>
<p>I think it was comprehensive planning, well in advance. We started planning when Wuhan started reported Coronavirus cases in January. The health department constituted 18 expert groups and training for health care staff began. There was detailed stock-taking of beds, equipment and staff strength in each hospital.</p>
<p>All this was completed before Kerala received its first case from Wuhan on January 30. In the initial stage we had just three cases which were tackled successfully. When the cases began to increase, the Chief Minister convened a meeting of all departments and entrusted specific responsibilities.</p>
<p>Our effort right from the beginning was to bring all positive cases under government treatment facility and provide free treatment. Even foreigners were given free treatment. We had British citizens, including senior citizens, under treatment at the Ernakulam Medical College.</p>
<p>The British High Commissioner contacted the Chief Minister&rsquo;s office saying their nationals could be shifted to private hospitals and they would bear the expenses. We knew this was because of the general feeling that government hospitals lack facilities. The Chief Minister said that if the British nationals want to be treated in private hospitals, they may be permitted.</p>
<p>However, when we asked them, they preferred to get treated at the government medical college and lauded the facilities. They even gave in writing that they preferred government hospitals. Before leaving India after full recovery, they thanked us profusely.</p>
<p>The Nipah outbreak in 2018 helped us developing good team work, effective coordination between of the medical education directorate and the health department, putting in place standard operating procedures and protocols.</p>
<p>Q: Are you worried that situation could now go out of hand?</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of travel restrictions, people are coming by the air and sea routes, road and rail. We had created plan A, B and C to deal with different stages of Covid-19, where the cases are low, high and extremely high.</p>
<p>In medical colleges in each district, we have set aside 500-600 beds, 200-300 beds in taluk hospitals and hotels have been earmarked as Covid hospitals. The human resources required for the bed strength was mobilised, the private sector roped in and the staff trained.</p>
<p>We requested the Centre to allow only people in the priority category pregnant women, children, elderly, chronic patients, those who lost jobs and whose visa had expired to return home. This was to prevent a situation where 7 to 8 lakh people returned all of sudden, throwing everything out of gear.</p>
<p>Surveillance teams were deployed at airports, entry passes were made mandatory for people coming by road, help desks were set up at the border checkposts to segregate people district-wise and send them to their respective destinations.</p>
<p>At present, the majority of people are coming from Covid-19 hotspots. In the first phase people came at a time when virus had just begun to spread. The cases are high among returnees as they are coming from places like the UAE, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Q: Has community spread started in Kerala?</p>
<p>There is no community spread as of now but we can’t say that it will not happen tomorrow. Only when a large number of cases is reported from the community, and that too with no travel history, can we suspect community spread.</p>
<p>Q: Has your background as science teacher or as leader of All India Democratic Women&rsquo;s Association (AIDWA, a CPM-led womens organisaton) helped in dealing with the situation effectively?</p>
<p>I would say a mix of everything. I could ensure teamwork because of my background as a political worker and organiser. As state secretary of AIDWA, I had the experience of coordinating with people of each district. I created a family and “we” feeling in the department. I have a set of efficient and dedicated officers who have been given freedom and space to work. They came out with brilliant ideas. I trust them and support them.</p>
<p>My background as a science teacher has helped to some extent. You know it is not easy to understand technical and medical terms. But I have the curiosity to understand these terms. This curiosity has been there as a politician and as a teacher. I am not a voracious reader, but I try to update myself on the new findings, spread of new viruses and read magazines. I believe in science and its ability.</p>
<p>As CPM leader I used to take party classes for my comrades on the subject of Marxian philosophy, and you know that science is an integral part of that philosophy. We discussed topics like evolution of universe, how to interact with nature, how to think scientifically and scientific temper. As lay people we know only basics of science and that’s not enough. So whenever I get chance, I interact with experts to enhance my understanding about different subjects.</p>
<p>My present secretary health Dr Rajan Khobagade is a medical doctor. The previous secretary, Mr Rajeev Sadanandan, who was there during Nipah, is an expert on medical economy. I always clear my doubts with them.</p>
<p>At the district level I have district programme officers who are smart young boys. When I am not able to understand a particular thing I ask them, &ldquo;son please explain it to me.” They are happy to brief me on every issue. But when they seek my advise, I don the role a teacher. The youngsters feel comfortable working with me as their ideas and projects are well received. The entire staff from doctors, nursing staff, lab technicians, administrators to santiation workers, all work as a team.</p>
<p>As an administrator I am also a tough taskmaster. In case of any lapse I reprimand them strongly. Even for small reprimand they feel bad.</p>
<p>Q. Are you able to time spend time with your family, particularly your grandchildren due to the current tight schedule?</p>
<p>For the last two-and-a-half months I could not meet my granddaughter who is two. She lives in Kannur, about 450 km from Thiruvanantharuam. Last week, I went to meet her without informing anyone. She was so happy. All these days she was watching me on TV or on Whatsapp videoes. She was crying profusely when I left her.</p>
<p>It’s quite hectic. I start getting calls as early as 6 am. By 8.30 am I leave for office. There are meetings, conferences, video conferences, CM’s review meetings and discussions with expert groups though the day. I leave office by 11 pm.</p>
<p>Q: Opposition leaders have called you a publicity seeker. How do you react?</p>
<p>They attacked me personally and tried to corner me. Initially I felt very bad as I had not come across such scathing attacks. As MLA I was not into decision-making. As minister, I often come under criticism. I used to get restless and sad. My party leaders including CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan advised me not to get demoralised and go forward strongly.

<p>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A mere slip of the tongue during an interview to BBC has landed Health Minister KK Shailaja in a soup as she finally had to reach out to the Goa chief minister tendering an apology for the mistake she had accidentally committed. Answering a query, she said a patient from Goa had to be treated in Kerala owing to poor facilities there and she described Goa as a union territory. Seeing the slip, Goa’s ruling party and chief minister demanded an apology from Shailaja.</p>
<p>Finally, she had to reach out to Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant personally to tender an apology. According to sources, though the minister reached out to the Goan chief minister on phone, he was not available. Later, she sent a message to him apologising for the mistake and he replied to her accepting the apology. She also clarified that she was supposed to say Mahe, a union territory surrounded by Kerala and under the jurisdiction of Puducherry, instead of Goa.</p>
<p>The office of the minister clarified that it was a mere slip of tongue and nothing intended to tarnish the image of Goa. Soon after the interview went viral, Sawant tweeted: “I am appalled by the factually incorrect statements of Kerala Health Minister Smt. KK Shailaja Ji during her interview with the BBC regarding the death in Kerala of a Covid positive patient from Goa.</p>
<p>The said patient to our knowledge and as confirmed by Kerala IDSP team is not from Goa and has not travelled from here for lack of health facilities. Second, Goa has a dedicated Covid-19 Hospital to deal with the pandemic. Seven patients have fully recovered after receiving treatment from the said hospital and we continue to treat Covid-19 patients from Goa as well as from other states.</p>
<p>Third, Goa has outstanding healthcare facilities with Goa Medical College being one of the oldest and finest medical colleges in Asia.” “For decades, we have been treating a large number of non-Goan patients, especially from our neighbouring states for different ailments. At last, I also want to inform you Madam that Goa is a full-fledged state and not a union territory,” he tweeted.

<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/5/20/w600X390/KK_Shailaja_EPS.jpg" alt="img">
By Express News Service</p>
<p>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Well before the world realised the threat of COVID-19, it had caught the attention of Kerala&rsquo;s Health Minister KK Shailaja who happened to read the reports emerging from China since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Even before COVID-19 acquired the name it was known as novel coronavirus or simply coronavirus to the world atleast till the first few weeks of January. The reporting of cases in Wuhan in China caught the attention of KK Shailaja.</p>
<p>She was familiar with the situation as she was involved in the successful containment of the Nipah virus outbreak in the first half of 2018. The experience helped her to prepare for a containment strategy even before the first passenger from Wuhan reached Kerala.</p>
<p>Shailaja&rsquo;s foresight in preparing the state and her ability to communicate the decisions to the public, have gained world attention through the international media. As the worldwide death toll crossing 3 lakh and India&rsquo;s death toll crossing 3000 there are reasons why people are looking for right strategies from Kerala which is located at the southern tip of the Indian continent.</p>
<p>At a time COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the dearth of leadership in fighting against the novel disease, the world is keenly watching at any possible success stories at the nook and corner. The success in flattening the curve in less than 100 days after the first case was reported and more importantly in restricting the deaths caused by pandemic to just three are not mean achievements by any standard. The state has one of the best recovery rates in the world. So what are the factors that favored the state apart from an alert leadership?</p>
<p>There was a contingency plan in place, said Shailaja in an interview with an international media. She spoke about the strategies adopted right from the beginning when people started arriving from outside, the testing methods adopted that suited the ability of the state and the contact tracing system which in a sense is unique to Kerala with its strong grass root level linkages. Also, she talked about the effectiveness of home quarantine where the people themselves took the responsibility to prevent the spread.</p>
<p>The world watched with interest when she shared the success tips when people in several developed countries are protesting against the lockdown measures that confine them to homes. Some of the actions were proactive measures much before the World Health Organisation came up COVID-19 protocol emphasizing test, trace, isolate and support. She summed up the interview by highlighting the socio-economic advantages and the way ahead for the state in fighting the disease.</p>
<p>The journey was not smooth as the state vigil was constantly challenged. When there was a feeling that the state was successful in tracing and confining people coming from abroad. A family that just returned from Italy to Pathanamthitta failed to alert the authorities about their travel history and their free-mingling in the society created panic when the members were tested positive.</p>
<p>However, the state apparatus managed to check the contagion in the region. In 23 days the COVID care centre helped in the recovery of the family patriarch and his wife who are aged 93 and 88 years respectively. The state has also managed to trace all people who attended a Tablighi meeting in Delhi in April.</p>
<p>In the month of May, the challenge was to manage the influx of people returning from abroad and from other parts of the country. The elaborate arrangement in keeping a record of people arriving and the quarantine facilities are the ongoing challenges the state is dealing with as the number of people under treatment has crossed 100.</p>
<p>Media attention</p>
<p>The 63-year-old minister was featured by several international media including The Guardian which gave a detailed account of the minister&rsquo;s activities from the very beginning. The latest was the five-minute live appearance at the BBC World News aired on May 18.</p>
<p>The Washington Post, The Economist and non-English media houses in West Asia, Africa, Europe too have written about the success of Kerala and its pandemic Czar. Many of them have been tracking her ever since the success of Kerala in handling the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018.</p>
<p>Often the comparisons are made with world leaders who were successful in containing the pandemic in their region. Her social media accounts were keenly watched by the world which liberally used it in the articles. It was widely shared by the Kerala diaspora spread across the world.</p>
<p>Kerala&rsquo;s firm but the humane approach has attracted people outside and it was only natural for media to pick up the leader behind it, said a Non-Resident Keralite living in Northern Virginia in USA.</p>
<p>The handling of migrant labourers issue and starting community kitchen for people affected by lockdown have gained wide attention in social media.

<h3 id="kerala-likely-to-send-team-of-doctors-nurses-to-maharashtra">&ldquo;Kerala likely to send team of doctors, nurses to Maharashtra&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/news/kerala/images/2020/3/9/kk-shailaja.jpg" alt="img">
Kerala government is likely to send a medical team to Mumbai to assist Maharashtra in its fight against COVID-19 by the end of this week. The team will comprise 50 doctors and 100 nurses. The Maharashtra government had sought the assistance of Kerala to plug the dearth in manpower in treating COVID-19 patients in the state.</p>
<p>The letter, sent by the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) to Kerala Health Minister K K Shailaja on Saturday, had asked for recruitment of these doctors and nurses on a “temporary basis”. Maharashtra has roughly 1.5 lakh nurses in both the private and public sectors. The state has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 patients in the country, with more than 50,000 cases. The state government had extended the lockdown sans relaxations till May 31 due to the spurt in cases.</p>
<p>“Our team is likely to head for Maharashtra by the end of this week,&rsquo;&rsquo; said an official with the Kerala health minister. “There is some reluctance among nurses as the payment is very less compared to what they get in Kerala. But we will be able to work it out,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the official.</p>
<p>Maharashtra had offered to pay Rs 30,000 for nurses. The doctors&rsquo; team will include pulmonologists, anaesthetists, physicians and junior doctors.</p>
<p>Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope, last week, had said that Maharashtra may take lessons from Kerala which is doing quite well on the COVID-19 front compared to other states. &ldquo;The structure of Maharashtra is quite different. However, some of the innovative initiatives undertaken by the Kerala health department will be discussed in Maharashtra,&rdquo; Tope had said after talking to Shailaja.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kerala&rsquo;s segregation policy, daily tests, measures taken to prevent infection in slums, the cooperation of private doctors, shortage of equipment, prevention in containment zones, use of plasma therapy were discussed,&rdquo; the state public health department had said in a press statement issued after the discussion between the two health ministers.</p>
<p>Dr Santosh Kumar, superintendent, Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, who had headed the medical team to Kasaragod district, which once had the highest number of cases in the country, is likely to head the team to Maharashtra.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of making a team of doctors and nurses working in the private sector. They can come back after the one-month period of the tenure or can stay back if they want,&rsquo;&rsquo; he told The WEEK. “But those who are coming back will have to go in quarantine for the stipulated time,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>“If Kerala is able to help Maharashtra in these hard times, it will be a good humanitarian gesture,&rsquo;&rsquo; Kumar said.</p>
<p>(The story first appeared in The Week)

<p>Asfaces its third phase of thepandemic, Health Ministerremarked that now is the time to exercise extreme caution. The Health Minister&rsquo;s call for &lsquo;extreme caution&rsquo; comes even as speculations are rife that the cash-strapped state government is bracing to resume liquor sales.The Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT) has reportedly pegged the state&rsquo;s potential revenue loss this fiscal at Rs 1,25,657 crore. On the other hand, the state recorded a spike in fresh cases with 26 cases on Thursday and 16 on Friday after almost flattening the curve.This is a more challenging phase than the first two. The fact that there is a spike in COVID-19 cases in other countries and the inflow of people from such countries to India and Kerala is on the rise is a matter of concern, Shailaja noted in an article she wrote for the CPI (M) mouthpiece Deshabhimani.In a press briefing on Friday evening, Chief Ministerheld that it does not make sense to discriminate against Keralites arriving home from abroad and other parts of the country. His view is that Kerala as a society will have to learn to live with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, mindful of all safety precautions and the essential need for physical distancing.&ldquo;We should realise it is not that easy to deal with the third phase even though the state&rsquo;s public health system, grassroot level democracy and comprehensive strategy has become a model for the whole world,&rdquo; Shailaja explained.A &lsquo;reverse quarantine&rsquo; system has been readied to keep vulnerable people such as senior citizens, pregnant women, children, differently-abled people and people with other ailments away from the repatriates arriving from coronavirus-affected places and to avert contact between them. The control rooms are looking into this area on a daily basis, she said.The fight to combat the disease without abandoning anyone to death will continue, the minister affirmed even as she underscored the importance of following government guidelines and the threat posed by people violating the guidelines like arriving in huge numbers without passes from the neighbouring states.
