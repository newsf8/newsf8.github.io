<p>More than 25 million user records, belonging to popular math app Mathway, are being sold on the dark web.</p>
<p>According to ZDNet, the hack is the latest in a long line of security breaches carried out by a hacker going by the name of ShinyHunters, the threat actor also responsible for intrusions at Tokopedia, Wishbone, Zoosk, and others. For the past few months, says ZDNet, the hacker has been breaching companies and putting their data on sale on a dark web marketplace and internet hacking forums. In total, it is believed that the hacker has sold access to more than 200 million user details.</p>
<p>In an interview with ZDNet, the hacker said he had breached Mathway in January 2020 by accessing the company&rsquo;s backend, dumping the database, and then removing access to avoid getting detected. But, since the start of May, the hacker has been selling the records on the dark web and on a popular hacking forum.</p>
<p>The Mathway data has been up for sale for the equivalent of $4,000 in Bitcoin or Monero, reports ZDNet. According to samples reviewed by ZDNet, the data includes user emails and hashed passwords. Since the password hashing algorithm is unknown, says ZDNet, it&rsquo;s unclear if these passwords can be cracked and reverted back to their cleartext forms, which would make the entire data dump a lot more valuable for other cybercrime gangs.</p>
<p>Terence Jackson, Chief Information Security Officer at Thycotic, says, “These attacks appear to just be targeting cloud misconfigurations, and they are looking for intellectual property and credentials which they will likely leverage in credential stuffing attacks. This reinforces that consumers need to utilize password managers to generate unique passwords for each site or service they access online. Hackers thrive on leaked or stolen credentials and password reuse the gain access to more personal data. The incident can also be used to reinforce security awareness training for employees and acceptable use of the corporate email addresses.”</p>
<p>Arun Kothanath, Chief Security Strategist at Clango, notes, “By monitoring and controlling who can access what in an IT environment, an organization can effectively defend against even the most sophisticated cyberattacks. In Mathway’s incident, a lack of access and privilege controls seems to have played a large role in preventing them from detecting a sophisticated sensitive data breach. Cybersecurity best practices would suggest that sensitive data should always be protected by reliable access controls. Credentials can be stolen, passwords can be cracked, but identity and access management (IAM) programs driven by best practices can prevent even the most skilled hacking groups from stealing sensitive data by ensuring proactive controls in place. Mathway could have been benefited from an IAM platform that would have raised alerts and warnings based on anomalies in access patterns and privilege violations.”

<h3 id="hacker-leaks-40-million-user-records-from-popular-wishbone-app">&ldquo;Hacker leaks 40 million user records from popular Wishbone app&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/05/20/779b46e7-3f48-48f3-bbbc-55c323de2cee/thumbnail/770x578/cd9c314a88babc5408685f3a54203cae/wishbone.png" alt="img">

<p>UPDATE: Twelve hours after this article went live, the Wishbone user database has leaked in full, being offered as a free download on one of the hacking forums it was being sold on. A well-known hacker known as ShinyHunters has taken credit for hacking the company, and Wishbone has formally acknowledged the breach in a statement sent to ZDNet. Our initial coverage is below, written from the perspective of the database being put up for sale.</p>
<p>A hacker has put up for sale today the details of 40 million users registered on Wishbone, a popular mobile app that lets users compare two items in a simple voting poll.</p>
<p>The data is being advertised across multiple hacking forums and being sold for 0.85 bitcoin (~$8000), according to ads seen by ZDNet.</p>
<p>According to the seller&rsquo;s claims and a sample of the data published online, the Wishbone data includes user information such as usernames, emails, phone numbers, city/state/country, but also hashed passwords.</p>
<p>Image: ZDNet</p>
<p>The hacker claims the passwords are in the SHA1 format; however the sample that ZDNet reviewed today contained passwords in MD5.</p>
<p>MD5 is a weak password hashing format that can be cracked to reveal the original plaintext passwords, which ZDNet was able to do for some accounts using freely available online tools.</p>
<p>The data also included links to Wishbone profile pictures. URLs included in the sample data loaded images depicting minors, an age category the Wishbone app has always been historically popular (to many parents&rsquo; dismay).</p>
<p>Wishbone hack took place earlier this year</p>
<p>The seller claims the Wishbone app data was obtained in a hack that took place earlier this year. User registration and last login dates included in the Wishbone data sample appear to confirm this statement, with all timestamps dating to January 2020.</p>
<p>It is unclear, however, if the individual who has placed all the ads on hacking forums is the actual hacker.</p>
<p>The person behind the forum ads is what security researchers call a &ldquo;data broker,&rdquo; a type of cyber-criminal specialized in buying and reselling hacked databases in the cybercriminal underground.</p>
<p>According to ads seen by ZDNet, this threat actor is currently selling databases from tens of other companies, totaling more than 1.5 billion records.</p>
<p>Most of the databases are from companies that have reported hacks in previous years. Wishbone was also hacked in 2017 when a hacker obtained details for 2.2 million users.</p>
<p>ZDNet verified today that the data sample from this recent hack was not included in the 2017 hack. We took user emails from today&rsquo;s data sample and verified them against Have I Been Pwned, a website that lets users check if their emails have been included in previous hacks.</p>
<p>However, since Have I Been Pwned allows users to hide their email from public searches, we also verified these emails against a private platform managed by threat intelligence KELA, which has also been indexing and tracking data leaked in older breaches.</p>
<p>None of the accounts included in the sample shared today were included in the 2017 Wishbone breach, confirming that these are new accounts, and this is a new hack.</p>
<p>Contacted for comment, a Mammoth Media spokesperson told ZDNet they are looking into the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protecting data is of the utmost importance,&rdquo; the company said. &ldquo;We are investigating this matter and will share any significant developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Wishbone has not revealed in recent years its total user count, the app has been in the iOS App Store Top 50 most popular social networking apps for years, reaching its peak in 2018, when it ranked in the category&rsquo;s top 10. On the Google Play Store, the app has between 5 million and 10 million downloads.

bhopal</p>
<p>Updated: May 11, 2020 06:40 IST</p>
<p>A digital tool used by Madhya Pradesh government to track people who are meant to be quarantined was found to have exposed the personal details, including real-time location, of thousands of individuals before it was pulled down on Sunday after a French computer programmer tweeted about it.</p>
<p>The database contained the names of people who are meant to be quarantined, information about the type of phone they used and their last known location – at times as accurate as within 5 metres – and was available for download on an mp.gov.in website. Before it was pulled down on Sunday evening, it contained the names of at least 5,400 people.</p>
<p>“There is some information on the portal which should not have been there. Hence, we are going to remove the dashboard and working on a new access strategy under which only authorised persons will be given access to information to the data,” said Nand Kumaram, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Madhya Pradesh Agency for Promotion of Information Technology (MAP-IT), a state government agency that developed the system from where the data was leaked.</p>
<p>MAP-IT is a part of Madhya Pradesh government’s department of science and technology and uses a mobile phone application called Sarthak that needs to be installed by people who need to be under home quarantine since they may have or are confirmed to have the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).</p>
<p>“Sarthak App is to help us in Covid management. The information stored in the App is confidential and is not meant for making it public. However, we are trying to verify if names being made public on the portal are real ones or as stored in the app,” Kumaram added.</p>
<p>Privacy and health experts said the leak, exposed by the French man who guys by the nom de guerre of Elliot Alderson in a tweet on Sunday afternoon, was a major breach. “If you store data in such a risky manner, where it could immediately lead to the identification of an individual, you have to security measures to make sure no one can access it. They didn’t do that here and the Madhya Pradesh government is now legally responsible if there is a breach of such people’s privacy,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director and senior international counsel at Access Now.</p>
<p>The Union government had in an advisory on April 8 said that those affected by Covid-19 or under quarantine should not be identified.</p>
<p>“It can’t be allowed this way. Making public name of any quarantined person without his consent is violation of his rights. The information is for analysis and follow-up, not to stigmatise people and create terror among them about Covid,” said Bhopal-based public health expert Amulya Nidhi. “There should be a detailed inquiry into this as to who allowed this and whether consent of quarantined people was taken for making public his name. Action should be taken against officials responsible,” he added.</p>
<p>Principal secretary, Health, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai said: “Sarthak app is to help the department to monitor quarantined people. I will look into it if something like this has happened.”</p>

<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Gobi-Feature-Card1.png" alt="img">
A leaked version of the iOS 14 update has been circulating for a few months, giving us an idea of what Apple is working on behind the scenes for the new update.</p>
<p>Details about iOS 14 have been trickling out , and today, Josh Constine (formerly of TechCrunch) has shared leaked Apple QR codes, details about Apple&rsquo;s work on an AR app, and sounds for the upcoming Apple Tags in his Moving Product newsletter</p>
<p>Apple appears to be implementing a new QR code format that uses colored cones, with the files found in the &ldquo;Gobi&rdquo; AR app that Apple has been working on. Constine says QR codes open up Mac Pro and Apple Watch websites, the Star Wars: Rogue One movie in iTunes, and the Starbucks Card sign-up.</p>
<p>The code also featured references to a Gobi comparison shopping feature that could be in the AR app, and, in line with previous rumors about a possible Starbucks partnership, there were references to Starbucks discounts at specific locations, which suggests the Gobi app could offer promotions or content experiences based on location.</p>
<p>A video shared by Constine also features sounds and vibrations that will be used in the Find My app to help people locate their lost devices. As described by Constine:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear encouraging sounds when you face the right direction so the lost gadget is &ldquo;Ahead&rdquo; of you, when you&rsquo;re &ldquo;Nearby&rdquo;, or come within &ldquo;Arms Reach&rdquo;, while discouraging tones hint that you&rsquo;re headed off course.</p>
<p>Many other leaked features have been found in ‌iOS 14‌, such as hints of a new fitness app, new features for Messages like mentions and retractions, new Apple Pencil features, Home screen updates, ‌Find My‌ changes for AirTags, the CarKey API that will allow an iPhone to be used in lieu of a CarKey, and tons more, with full details available in our iOS 14 roundup.

<h3 id="mathway-app-suffers-massive-data-breach-exposing-25-million-passwords">&ldquo;Mathway app suffers massive data breach exposing 25 million passwords&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.komando.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kk-article-20200525-25-million-records-sold-dark-web-data-breach-1200x675-1.jpg" alt="img">
It’s always disappointing when a popular, well-vetted program succumbs to the efforts of hackers and cybercriminals. We may rely on the apps we use each day to safely assist and entertain us, but when it comes to cybersecurity, we’re all on our own.</p>
<p>Most of the time, these kinds of breaches happen without warning — and they’re not always the fault of the company involved. After all, a popular app means more juicy targets for hackers and dark web shoppers to prey on. Tap or click here to see how MyFitnessPal suffered a similar fate in 2018.</p>
<p>And now, one of the most highly rated and popular apps on Android and iOS appears to have suffered a data breach of its own. A database belonging to this app was discovered for sale on a Dark Web marketplace, and the files involved include email addresses and passwords. If you share a password with any other accounts, it’s time to change it immediately!</p>
<p>Mathway learns about data breaches the hardway</p>
<p>According to BleepingComputer, cybersecurity firm Cyble detected what appeared to be a potential data breach of Mathway, a popular free calculator app that can solve complex math problems. The app is well received, with over 10 million downloads on Android and a rank of #4 under education in the iOS App Store.</p>
<p>Cyble initially discovered the breach thanks to the efforts of the Shiny Hunters, a hacking collective notorious for selling stolen data on Dark Web marketplaces. An alleged Mathway database was among the wares the Shiny Hunters had for sale, which includes data points like email addresses, passwords and back-end system data.</p>
<p>Tap or click here to see what the Shiny Hunters were up to last time.</p>
<p>Mathway responded to BleepingComputer by confirming they were investigating the issue. Meanwhile, registered Mathway members may want to confirm whether or not their data was included in the breach by visiting Cyble’s AmIBreached website and checking their email address.</p>
<p>Why is this breach bad? It doesn’t seem like a lot of personal information leaked</p>
<p>Looks can be deceiving. If a person has an account breach, the password they used for that account is now forfeit to whoever stole or purchased it. But let’s take things a step further: Suppose the breached account included an email address and a password.</p>
<p>Naturally, a hacker’s first instinct will be to check if they can log into that email account using the password they obtained. Many people have a tendency to use the same password across multiple accounts, and this mistake can lead to a hacker (like our hypothetical one) gaining access to all your accounts.</p>
<p>If you were affected by this breach, your first priority is to change your password for Mathway, followed by any other accounts that share the same password. Make it something complex enough where it can’t be guessed but easy enough to save or remember. Tap or click here to find out how to make stronger passwords than ever before.</p>
<p>In the future, you may want to create separate email addresses for your online accounts to prevent further breaches can happen. Until biometrics or another, more secure standard than passwords are widely adopted, we’ll have to prepare for leaks like this on a regular basis. Tap or click here to see what the end of passwords might look like.

<h3 id="indias-covid-19-contact-tracing-app-could-leak-patient-locations">&ldquo;India&rsquo;s Covid-19 Contact Tracing App Could Leak Patient Locations&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5eb1ab54ddbe780004008159/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Security_ct_india-1211853690.jpg" alt="img">
As countries around the world rush to build smartphone apps that can help track the spread of Covid-19, privacy advocates have cautioned that those systems could, if implemented badly, result in a dangerous mix of health data and digital surveillance. India&rsquo;s new contact tracing app may serve as a lesson in those privacy pitfalls: Security researchers say it could reveal the location of Covid-19 patients not only to government authorities but to any hacker clever enough to exploit its flaws.</p>
<p>Independent security researcher Baptiste Robert published a blog post today sounding that warning about India’s Health Bridge app, or Aarogya Setu, created by the government’s National Informatics Centre. Robert found that one feature of the app, designed to let users check if there are infected people nearby, instead allows users to spoof their GPS location and learn how many people reported themselves as infected within any 500-meter radius. In areas that have relatively sparse reports of infections, Robert says hackers could even use a so-called triangulation attack to confirm the diagnosis of someone they suspect to be positive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The developers of this app didn’t think that someone malicious would be able to intercept its requests and modify them to get information on a specific area,&rdquo; says Robert, a French researcher known in part for finding security vulnerabilities in the Indian national ID system known as Aadhaar. &ldquo;With triangulation, you can very closely see who is sick and who is not sick. They honestly didn’t consider this use of the app.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security researchers like Robert have focused their attention on Aarogya Setu in part due to its sheer scale. The Indian government has declared the contact tracing app mandatory for many workers and it&rsquo;s already been downloaded more than 90 million times according to government officials.</p>

<p>Unlike many of the apps rolling out across Europe now and soon in the United States, Aarogya Setu traces potentially infected people&rsquo;s movements via GPS rather than Bluetooth data alone. It may represent a cautionary tale about how flawed implementations of contact tracing apps—particularly those that rely on location data—can lead to serious leaks of sensitive medical information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect many of the contact tracing apps to have these types of issues, and I think particularly the ones that rely on GPS are going to be more privacy invasive,&rdquo; says Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission lead technologist who reviewed Robert&rsquo;s findings and analyzed other contact tracing apps. &ldquo;When you tie it to something like health status, it’s not surprising that these types of inferences can be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert first recognized Aarogya Setu&rsquo;s privacy problem when he analyzed a feature that checks for reports of infected people within a certain radius. He found that by mimicking those requests from his laptop, he could simply spoof his location, altering the queries to ask for the number of infected people in a 500-meter radius around any latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>That GPS spoofing possibility is troubling enough on its own. If someone lives in a remote area, they could easily be identified as Covid-19 positive. But Robert suggests that the bug could also be used to carry out a technique known as triangulation or trilateration, finding the reported Covid-19 status of someone in a far more targeted location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The intended use of the apps is privacy invasive.&rdquo; Former FTC Technologist Ashkan Soltani</p>
<p>If a hacker suspects that someone has Covid-19, they could check a series of overlapping 500-meter circular areas around their target, carefully placing the centers of those circles so that they don’t cover their target’s home, but so that the edges of the circles create a boundary around it. If each of those 500-meter-radius areas contains zero infected people, the hacker would then draw new circle, this time positioning its center over the person’s home. If the count of sick people goes up by one, the hacker can deduce that an infected person is in that narrowly defined location. “If I want to know if the people in a house are sick, I can draw a boundary around it and the application will give me the result,” Robert says.

North Dakota&rsquo;s COVID-19 contact tracing app leaks location data to Foursquare and a Google Ads ID: Report</p>
<p>Your concerns about the privacy and security risks of using state-run coronavirus contact tracing apps? They&rsquo;re reasonable concerns.</p>
<p>This new report from mobile privacy firm Jumbo Privacy says the official North Dakota contact-tracing app is sharing location data with Foursquare and an advertising ID with Google.</p>
<p>Writes Steven Melendez for Fast Company:</p>
<p>The app, called Care19, and produced by a company called ProudCrowd that also makes a location-based social networking app for North Dakota State sports fans, generates a random ID number for each person who uses it. Then, it can “anonymously cache the individual’s locations throughout the day,” storing information about where people spent at least 10 minutes at a time, according to the state website. If users test positive for the coronavirus, they can provide that information to the North Dakota Department of Health for contact-tracing purposes so that other people who spent time near virus patients can potentially be notified. According to the app’s privacy policy, “location data is private to you and is stored securely on ProudCrowd, LLC servers” and won’t be shared with third parties “unless you consent or ProudCrowd is compelled under federal regulations.” But according to the Jumbo report, the app sends the random ID number, along with a phone ID used for advertising purposes and apparent latitudes and longitudes of places visited by the user, to Foursquare, a leading location-data provider. The app also sends the random ID to servers run by Bugfender, a Barcelona-based service used by app makers to track and diagnose software malfunctions, according to Jumbo, which monitored internet traffic generated by the app. It’s accompanied by the phone’s name, which often includes the device owner’s first name, according to the report. The phone’s advertising ID is also sent to Google servers that appear to be affiliated with Google’s Firebase service, Jumbo found.</p>
