<p>संगीतकार को मुंबई के एक अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया था और दुबई के न्यूजपेपर खलीज टाइम्स की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक कथित तौर पर उनको वेंटिलेटर पर भी रखा गया था। वाजिद, अपने भाई साजिद खान के साथ दबंग, वांटेड और जय हो सहित कई बॉलीवुड फिल्मों का हिट म्यूजिक दे चुके थे। पिछले कुछ साल से वाजिद किडनी की समस्या से पीड़ित थे।</p>

<p>साजिद खान ने हमेशा किया भाई को सपोर्ट</p>
<p>वाजिद खान के सगे भाई साजिद खान लगातार उनके साथ पिलर की तरह खड़े रहे हैं। चाहे बात प्रोफेशनल लाइफ की हो या फिर पर्सनल की। वाजिद को अपने भाई का हर जगह सपोर्ट मिला है। यहां तक कि दोनों ने साथ मिलकर अपने हिट सॉन्ग और कंपोजीशन बनाए।</p>
<p>साजिद-वाजिद ने 1998 में सलमान खान स्टारर प्यार किया तो डरना क्या के साथ बॉलीवुड में अपनी शुरुआत की थी। बाद में सलमान की फिल्मों के लिए दोनों ने कई गाने किए। इनमें चोरी चोरी, हैलो ब्रदर, मुझसे शादी करोगी, पार्टनर, वांटेड और दबंग 1 , 2 और 3 शामिल हैं। हाल ही में, साजिद-वाजिद ने सलमान के नए गाने भाई भाई को कंपोज किया था। एक गायक के रूप में, वाजिद खान ने अपने करियर की शुरुआत 2008 में फिल्म पार्टनर से की थी। उन्होंने हुड हुड दबंग, जलवा, चिन्ता ता तो चिता चिता और फेविकोल से जैसे लोकप्रिय गाने गाए।</p>
