<li>
<p>hell yeah, girl. I FELT that point about ‚Äúit shouldn‚Äôt be on us to do hours of research to make sure brands are doing what they should do‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wholeheartedly believe that sustainability and capitalism can&rsquo;t be mixed. Companies will always be vauge and unethical if they become to large because employing people if done right is expensive. I prefer to mix thrifting with artisan shopping at this point because artists care about their craft and usually treat their employees as family. 2020 has been the greatest year about exposing truths I think it has been a wonderful year thus far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt understand how a brand can be sustainable and racist. It just feels like they‚Äôre such huge hypocrites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you did this video! Bc it&rsquo;s true, as a Black woman who&rsquo;s a fashion industry professional I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of unethical behavior, discrimination and unethical practices. This truly resonated. I&rsquo;m also a writer. I&rsquo;m working on a story to feature on a site I write for. I&rsquo;m truly disgusted to learn that these companies are actively and blatantly  being racist , but I&rsquo;m not surprised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudos to you girl for being in the STRUGGLE and doing the work to back it up. Already subscribed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I shop at Aritzia bc they have cute stuff and bc they have my size, but everytime I come in the store I always get ‚Äúlooks‚Äù from the staff as if like their almost judging me. Anyways, I‚Äôm glad I decided to just shop online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòÇüòÇ expose them all!!! I been knew Aritzia was racist because everytime I went in there (3 different Montr√©al locations), I never saw a black person working there and nobody would acknowledge my presence. I would literally be in the fitting rooms for 20 mins and never got service, but other white women had the most amazing customer experience. And I would leave empty handed not because I‚Äôm Black, but because my experience was truly disgusting so most times, I never ended up buying anything. But all these brands, just based on their social media posts, you know they are not diverse. I can only speak about Reformation and Aritzia because these are the ones I‚Äôve seen/experienced. Their IG pages are very white and their brands scream ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù so I‚Äôm not surprised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah it‚Äôs been wild to watch these brands be exposed as they post vague comments/posts. I‚Äôm really over the performative elements of ‚Äúallyship‚Äù from people in the wake of these most recent murders, because I know that as a black woman, my interactions with people in real life tell me so much more about their values than their social media. I‚Äôm glad to see people use platforms for good, but I can‚Äôt wait for the day that actions align. I‚Äôm not even a purchaser of much (not thrifted ) sustainable clothing because I‚Äôve been in school up until a month ago, but as I look forward, I‚Äôm definitely keeping my eye on sustainable and black owned brands that are actually enacting the values they claim to have. Thank you for using your platform to address this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANK you for holding these brands accountable and not just letting them slip by doing the bare minimum!!! If you have the money and power and influence u need to be using it and not being shady and cutting corners!! Thank you a million times for educating your viewers on this as well üíì</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is so important. fashion brands are so often &lsquo;sustainable&rsquo; and even &lsquo;ethical&rsquo; (i.e. contracted factories are paid a legal wage) but are STILL anti-union and shut down their own workers&rsquo; efforts to get better pay and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I Thrift Everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Vote by our dollar&rdquo; üëèüèΩ‚úäüèΩüëåüèΩü§é</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You truly deserve more subscribers! AGAIN YOU ARE AHEAD OF THE CROWD CYNTHIA!! First it was SUSTAINABLE CLOTHING, now HUMANLY ETHICAL BRANDS! Love it! üëçüèºü•∞ Now watch others follow üòÖ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for this. I have been removing so many brands from my list of who I support, a list that was already tiny. And I so agree about your point of how frustrating it is for all of the onus on conscious consumption to sit with the consumer. Brands have become so adept at green washing and hiding their unethical and unsustainable practices behind aesthetic pictures and a good slogan, and I‚Äôm honestly sick of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just canceled my Pangaia order! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love this video. Pangaia seems questionable as to how they‚Äôre handling it, they respond to a lot of comments on their preorders and never even acknowledge my comment when i asked about their founder so I‚Äôm holding off ordering from them for now. Hopefully they make a statement in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the tea! More please (would be interested to know about Everlane). I really appreciate you acknowledging the overlap between sustainability and racism&hellip; that comment about toxic sludge üòµüòµ Thank you so much!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found your channel the other day looking for a review on the Pangaia and was waiting to purchase, and now this!! Thank you for this video, now will not be purchasing from them. Love the videos, you have a new subscriber ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for sharing thisüòä! Yes we should all be more aware of the brands and companies we support from now on and i do believe the founders do count in these assessments because they are essentially the face.

<li>
<p>Just wanted to add that I also agree in &lsquo;vague&rsquo; statements from big brands (Pangaia).  Although it is difficult to draw the line, I find that founders of organization play a heavy role in shaping the existing policies/culture in depts/organizations/companies/brand. CEOs of companies often have appease shareholders that have largely invested in the company. So if the shareholders have such a heavy hand in the values and investment of the company, it will definitely trickle down to what the CEO, upper management, middle management determine as priority/culture/value/ across the entire organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time I wanted to get something from Reformation something and  I don&rsquo;t know what stopped me. Thank God I never gave them any of my money!! This video just solidified my reason for not shopping Reformation. Just looked up new Classics Studio and WOW they got some cool pieces. Thank you!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your thoughts and research. I think unions are tricky. First, I‚Äôll say that my parents were teachers in Ontario, so I was always pro-union and still am in some cases. But I worked for a company with unions that in some cases supported appalling behaviour by employees. Remember they have leaders that are human with flaws just like business leaders. If you have a racist union leadership for example, they will act accordingly and protect the status quo of a predominantly white work force if that exists. And there is evidence the police unions are some of the strongest resisters to positive change because their first priority is to protect the workers‚Äô jobs. I‚Äôm not saying this is the case with Everlane at all (I don‚Äôt know) but I‚Äôve worked for plenty of companies that have great working practices without the need for a union. Also, unions charge a fee that the members need pay and in some cases you have no choice to be a member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thank you so much for such a passionate video! I learned so much from this, &amp; I agree that the intersections of fashion, ethics, eco-consciousness, &amp; anti-racism are so important. I appreciate you! sending love from nyc! xx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to do this, we know capitalism is driven by profit but consumers have more power than they realize. We should always aim to take the time to evaluate the brands we support and vote with our wallet. Accountability is important because silence should never be acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well geez&hellip; I just ordered a bunch of stuff from  Aritzia üòï I didn‚Äôt know any of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is good information to know. Thank you for letting us know where not to spend my money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WE LOVE AN INFORMED QUEEN üåôüíú</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Sad thing is everlane is one of the few that is affordable and size inclusive. At this point I think I&rsquo;ll just learn how to sew. Thank you for the video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the informative video! We definitely want a full video on Everlane!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was very insightful!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg this is so sad. I literally just watched your Pangaia video last night :( and seeing the stuff about reformation :(((( and now hearing about everlane greenwashing. I already feel like it‚Äôs hard to find brands that have my check list. Sigh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cynthia Always</p>

<p>yes girl, you said this so well, and thank you for this video and all your videos xx i am going to add this to my list of checks as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for this video and keeping us aware of what is happening!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crap, I just bought stuff from Everlane&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE your videos! This video must have been difficult to create emotionally. I am glad you are opening up about brands you will no longer support after self-reflecting and supporting BLM movement. It is wonderful that you are being accountable for previous mistakes (brands you supported in older videos) and moving forward in a more positive direction. I&rsquo;m glad to be your subscriber and proud that you have grown individually and looking forward to seeing your channel/videos evolve as you continue to educate yourself and your subbies about ethical / sustainable / ally brands. - xoxo subbie from Toronto, Ontario</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! i stand by you and everything you said. thank you for your care, activism, and voice. it&rsquo;s so important that we continue to push for change and REAL transparency with fashion companies. Because as you stated, it&rsquo;s all intertwined!!!! If we care about people i.e. racism and marginalized communities, then we need to care about the environment too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for this! I want to be more conscious about supporting ethical brands, this was a very informative! I will definitely be purchasing from the ‚Äúbrands you love‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am shocked about Pangaia!! OMG I was about to purchase from them!! THANK YOU!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re cool ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sucks man, in recent years I‚Äôve really learned a lot about the importance of sustainability in the fashion industry and was ready to invest in some pieces from about two thirds of the companies mentioned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Super Happy to have found your channel ‚Äî thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for this&ndash; I&rsquo;m really sad about some of those brands because I love their clothes, but there definitely needs to be an intersection of racial justice as well as ethical labor and true sustainability because in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; all of those things are inextricably related. Social and environmental justice cannot be separated!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for posting this!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the issue with pushing for unionization is that this may drive a business to further outsource to countries of cheaper labour, as have happened to countless American businesses, which is worse imo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>13:53 when you said that I FELT that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I respect you! I respect this post. As consumers, we should really be aware of the companies we support. Our dollar matters. The companies only do well with our support (figuratively and monetarily). The consumers are more valuable and powerful than companies want to admit. Thanks for this post!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thank you for this video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for sharing this video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bottom line: a new shirt or dress means far less than the mistreatment of workers and polution of the earth!  We all need to slow down and research the companys we are giving our money to. I dont care how rich or poor you are, our money makes a difference. Look at how the workers are being treated and how much the company really cares about the earth and people in it. The new trend is corperations pretending or using the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; to trick customers. The treament of people and the earth should mean more to us than a stupid new pair of shoes that no one could give a shit that you are wearing. Do something that actually matters then you will LOOK COOL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG pls do the everlane video PLSSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOVE this video. New subscriber here. Everlane has creeped me out for years. They‚Äôve been asked to prove their sustainability claims through 3rd party testing and have simply ignored requests. Then the anti-union. Now there‚Äôs info about company wide racism (check out ex.wives.club on Insta for more info).

<p>Thanks for this informative video. I made a mention of Pangaia‚Äôs homophobic/transphobic founder on their IG page and my comment was deleted. Such a shady company and I am glad I am not spending a dime on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>awesome video Cynthia and thank you for all your research!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@inspiroue - Thank you so much for sharing!!! I would like to stay anonymous but I was in absolute SHOCK when I found out about the supposedly all-inclusive, sustainable brand Pangaia, which Miroslava Duma is the founder of (as said by Forbes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done for making this video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow thank you for the update&hellip; I am very shocked about Miraduma. Could you please make an update video on Pangaia and miraduma?</p>

<p>I love your video! I use to only buy Thrift products in order to not support mass production. You inspire me to back to my old ways.  Thinking critically and becoming aware is the only way for change! Your helping our youth grow. Keep up the good work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excellent video! i hope these brands see your video. I&rsquo;m still mad about how though the founder of Ref stepped down, she appointed her equally as racist friend as CEO which must be stopped. as @defundracists said on insta, things won&rsquo;t really change until the other 3 toxic people leave. Ciera (store manager of their Melrose location) who talks down to her associates by calling them fat, sluts, ugly, etc. Kaci and HR knew about this yet didn&rsquo;t do anything to get rid of her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very important info, and glad you are helping keep us informed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethical fashion is tough, and it gets exhausting keeping up with everything, but it&rsquo;s still important to do what we can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exacerbating that is the fact a lot of thrift stores are 1. Raising their prices, and getting more picked over. 2. A lot of thrift stores aren&rsquo;t terribly ethical (value Village/savers is walmart owned, Goodwill had some corruption in the leadership and underpaid disabled workers, and a lot of religious thrift stores are linked to organizations/churches that are anti-LGBTQ and promote problematic things like missionary work)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent video!! Subscribed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is basically why i just thrift everything . i do like girlfriend collective but to be honest can‚Äôt afford it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love your content and I can see that you have passion for true sustainable fashion! btw I would like to see that video about everlane!</p>

<p>As of this week I stopped all fashion/Lifestyle blogs. It was going that direction before these events but now.. Most of them were just out to make a buck selling crappy gifted clothing by some of the brands mentioned. On top of the phony &ldquo;rage&rdquo; they felt for recent events meanwhile promoting other forms of hate and false promotion / links to things that contribute to the problem. My time is far too precious to waste on phony people. No more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tricky  to care about sustainable fashion  , support certain brands only for them to disappoint us. Either because of the green-washing or racist practices. I read somewhere that &lsquo;&lsquo;ethical consumerism is impossible under capitalism&rsquo;&rsquo; and to some extent I agree. I&rsquo;m starting to believe that sustainable fashion will always come with a hefty price tag ie: Stella McCartney and Mara Hoffman. As a fellow advocate of slow fashion, thank you for taking a stand with this video. Sending love!</p>

<p>Honestly people should do their own research on certain brands and if it‚Äôs a company they want to support. This ‚ÄúAll companies need to do exactly what I expect of them with no effort as a consumer to change habits‚Äù is a huge cop out. We as consumers have the ability to force companies to change. Not ‚Äúcompanies should change their habits and consumers don‚Äôt‚Äù they get away with it because of that type of consumer spending and habits. People want to be led by leaders and corporations. And putting pressure and expecting accountability from these businesses with little accountability as a spender is ignorant. Do research. Form your own opinions. Vote. Make decisions based on facts and what‚Äôs best for your own families. Don‚Äôt support companies and policies that directly violate our rights.</p>

<p>That picture is Not Mira Duma,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick correction - the photo is not of Mira Duma on the chair, BUT it was a photoshoot she creatively directed, approved of, and thought was OK. It was published by BURO 247 (owned by her). The fact that she thought this was ok and issued no real apology acknowledging that fact is an example of her racism (this article <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/01/61052/miroslava-duma-racist-chair">https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/01/61052/miroslava-duma-racist-chair</a> speaks more to it and mentions she wrote an &lsquo;apology&rsquo; on an IG post that is now private). At this point, vague apologizes rooted in excuses (and no true acknowledgement of the racism of that photo) is not acceptable. Plus, her silence and lack of anti-racism commitment for being a founder, leader, and someone with over 1M+ followers goes to show you what side she&rsquo;s on.</p>

<p>Why has this become some trend? its ridiculous..a good reason to never have supported these would be to do with china and labour and the environment. Its frustrating to see an ignorant sad event turned into an everything racist circus that it has become. Racism has always existed. this isnt new information, why care now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not everyone has to support BLM. I‚Äôm a BLK woman and they don‚Äôt represent ALL Black ppl. If all BLK lives matter diversity of thought should also matters. I think ppl support things they get emotional about that they haven‚Äôt properly researched. It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt buy from them and you support BLM buy everyone has the right to research and choose what they support for themselves.</p>
