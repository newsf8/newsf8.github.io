<p>Michelle Fox is the star of BBC Three drama Overshadowed (Picture: Will Bremridge)</p>
<p>Actress Michelle Fox talks to us about her new BBC Three drama Overshadowed for the third in our Ones To Watch series. The Doctors star dipped her toe into the world of online video blogs for the role, and gave us her thoughts on why people like watching other people’s lives so much.</p>
<p>Stephen Fry hits out at Matt Hancock for ordering public to do &lsquo;civic duty&rsquo;</p>
<p>Based on the award-winning play by Eva O’Connor, Overshadowed follows Imogene (Fox) – an ordinary teenage girl who shares her life with the world through a series of online vlogs.</p>
<p>As the vlogs continue, people start to notice she is becoming gaunt and obsessed with exercise, and her new ‘best friend’ Anna (played by O’Connor) is behind it.</p>
<p>Imogene shares her life online through video blogs (Picture: Andrew Boyce/BBC)</p>
<p>Across the eight episodes, told in 10-minute vlog format, Imo transforms from sparky and outgoing to withdrawn and secretive, her life spiralling out of control when she meets the monster of anorexia personified.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>To get into her role, Michelle delved into the insanely popular world of vlogging and found that it goes much deeper than cooking, make-up and gaming.</p>
<p>Talk a bit about your character</p>
<p>She’s a 17-year-old, happy go lucky girl, she’s a bit naive but she’s very funny and down to earth. I think she’s very good-natured. Through her vlogs, she wants to document her life and maybe gain more followers and friends, and maybe up her self esteem a bit. I think it just goes tragically wrong through no fault of her own, I think that’s what we try to show with Overshadowed. The eating disorder is very much a separate entity to her.</p>
<p>How does the vlog format work for Overshadowed?</p>
<p>No one on the crew had filmed like this before. Imogene is filming absolutely everything, so everything that the viewer sees Imogene is either filming herself or filming other people. A lot of the scenes are vlogs to the internet, or other times she’s vlogging and then puts the camera down and we catch a glimpse behind the facade of her vlog.</p>
<p>imo’s life is taken over by her new ‘best friend’ Anna (Picture: BBC)</p>
<p>I think at the start it’s very much her show and what she wants to show to people. But as it goes on, her videos kind of get a bit out of control, and she’s no longer putting on a show for people. It’s literally just her trying to survive through these videos. I’ve never seen anything shot like that before. So it was really different. There’s eight episodes and they’re all ten minutes each, kind of like a long YouTube video.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>As it’s Imogene doing all the filming, did you have to pick up a camera yourself at all?</p>
<p>I did. The camera Imogene is supposed to be filming on is this Canon camera, but for most of the shoot it was our lovely DOP Alex who carrying this big, heavy filming camera, and I’m sort of holding on to the side of the lens the entire time.</p>
<p>We had a lot of fun when I was walking down the street and he was basically walking backwards in front of me holding this massive camera. Or when I’m running through the woods he’s running backwards through the woods. Or even something as simple as in the first episode where she goes to get a glass of water and walks upstairs talking to the camera – it just took so long because he’s walking backwards blind up the stairs.</p>
<p>And we also filmed on a Go Pro, and I would have a Go Pro attached to my chest when I was running. So there’s a lot of scenes where I’m accidentally filming arguments, or filming scenes on the Go Pro – and that was crazy!</p>
<p>The eight-part series is told through 10-minute blogs (Picture: BBC)</p>
<p>What research did you have to do for this role?</p>
<p>Because Imogene’s life, and I think a lot of teenagers’ lives, revolve around the internet now, I researched vlogs first of all. I went on to YouTube and first I watched really harmless ones – cooking and make-up vlogs, because Imogene does a lot of those things.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Then I delved into the darker side of YouTube. Vlogs on YouTube are basically like writing a diary and letting millions of strangers read it, and you don’t know when they’ve read it or what they think of you. They might even comment on YouTube, so there’s all these people who are basically involved in your diary. It’s quite uncomfortable at times, it feels like you’re invading someone’s privacy.</p>
<p>YouTube gets really, really dark. You see some people at their lowest point in their whole life.</p>
<p>Which scenes were uncomfortable to film?</p>
<p>What was shocking when I read the script was how blind Imogene is to the fact that this eating disorder is taking over her life. I think in the scenes towards the end of the series, she’s completely broken. She’s probably at the lowest point she will ever be in her life. They were extremely rewarding scenes but you do need to take some time out afterwards, because you’re dealing with a really serious subject.</p>
<p>Imogene’s life has spiralled out of control (Picture: BBC)</p>
<p>Vloggers are insanely popular – why do you think that is?</p>
<p>From doing my research, it’s like watching a series. You start out watching one or two vlogs and suddenly you’re watching them all night! It is quite addictive to watch people’s real lives, especially when something heartbreaking or fantastical is happening, you feel like you know the person, even though they’re a stranger to you.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>I think that’s why so many millions of people watch these vlogs. We show in the series that Imo is talking to her followers, and even her followers are worried about her, and some are supporting her, and then some are very much bullying her. Not everyone follows vlogs because they like a person. Sometimes it’s like a car crash and not being able to look away. I think some of these vloggers think that all this popularity is good, and sometimes it’s really not. We show that in the series, we show her getting a lot of attention online through her exercise regimes and very honest blogs, and I think she slowly begins to realise that the attention that she’s getting isn’t exactly the attention that she wants. So she might be popular but it might be for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>Who inspires you as an actor?</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of women who write their own stuff. I think Phoebe Waller Bridge and also Michaela Coel are really innovative in their writing and performances. They’re not showing women as just the sister or the girlfriend.</p>
<p>Michelle is a fan of Chewing Gum creator Michaela Coel (Picture: Channel 4)</p>
<p>I’m really excited about the new wave of female writers, directors and producers who are pushing new female characters and storylines that are interesting.</p>
<p>Overshadowed will land as a box set on BBC Three from Sunday October 1.</p>

<p>Michelle Fox-Phillips is the co-founder of Transgender Detroit, which is hosting its annual Transgender Day of Empowerment on May 15 at Affirmations LGBT community center in Ferndale. The 61-year-old Warren activist hopes to honor the transgender community and promote education.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you begin Transgender Detroit?</li>
</ol>
<p>My late wife Jamie Phillips-Fox and I started Transgender Detroit in 2005 after serving on the board of Transgender Michigan. The transgender community is vastly underserved and we both felt that the transgender community needs support in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb County.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How did Transgender Day of Empowerment get started?</li>
</ol>
<p>One of our former board members, Tina Seitz, read an article about the same event being held in California. There they have their annual dinner to honor those people in the transgender community. Here in Detroit we decided to have a series of workshops to empower the transgender individual and to educate the LGB and ally communities about our community. This will be the fourth year that we are having this event.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What can attendees expect from this year’s event?</li>
</ol>
<p>People can expect a variety of speakers talking about legal issues, transitioning at work, transgender youth and how to make their voices heard. Because this is a pivotal year for politics, we need to motivate the transgender community to vote and to contact their representatives in Lansing and Washington, D.C. in regard to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and anti-bullying.</p>
<p>What is really exciting is our diverse panel of gender-variant individuals from the Latino/a community, as well as MTF, FTM gender queer and African-American communities. There will also be a wide variety of vendor tables for different organizations that have never participated in Transgender Day of Empowerment.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Tell me a little about your other volunteer work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I came out of the closet – meaning identifying as a transgender women – in 1998, I have worked with a number of organizations.</p>
<p>When I came to Affirmations I was the first transgender volunteer. When I first started volunteering, I worked the helpline and, along with Jamie, we did in-service education about the transgender community.</p>
<p>I have also, for the last seven years, been on the planning committee for the Affirmations Big Bash. It was there that I started the support group Transgender Rap.</p>
<p>I have also started a second support group at PFLAG Detroit for family and friends of transgender individuals, and I’m also on the board of PFLAG Detroit.</p>
<p>Currently I’m serving on the Triangle Pride Pac to make sure they have a transgender presence. I also have worked with the victim’s assistance program at Triangle involving a transgender victim. I have, in the past, been on the boards of Transgender Michigan and Crossroads.</p>
<p>When it warrants, I write opinion pieces for BTL.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What are you hoping Transgender Detroit gives to the local transgender community?</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually we would like to provide a variety of services, like legal advice and maybe provide the money for anyone who cannot afford a legal name change. Our organization would also do advocacy work for the transgender community. With the help of other organizations, we hope to provide medical help – i.e. hormones – for little or no cost.</p>
<p>Some of the events that we have helped so far are the Transgender Day of Remembrance, as well as a potluck dinner for those who have no one on Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas. As for advocacy, we organized along with Triangle and Affirmations to have the Buju Banton concert canceled and to have a replacement concert.</p>
<p>Everything that Transgender Detroit does is to be totally inclusive of all communities.</p>
