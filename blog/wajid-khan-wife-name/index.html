<p>After losing Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor in April this year, Bollywood is mourning yet another loss of music composer and singer Wajid Khan who passed away at an early age of 42. He breathed his last at a Mumbai-based hospital due to complications that arose from a kidney infection. The news of his demise came in early this morning. The entire Bollywood fraternity is mourning the loss of the musician. Several actors including Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Sonam Kapoor, and others expressed their grief over his untimely death. Wajid, known for his compositions for Salman’s superhit films such as Wanted, the Dabangg franchise and Ek Tha Tiger, was laid to rest at a Versova cemetery in the presence of close friends and family members.

<p>It is during rare moments in Hindi cinema when women are allowed sexual agency, with the filmmakers largely showing them as objects of desire. One actor who turned this reductive portrayal on its head was Fatima Rashid, better known as Nargis. On her birthday today, a look at her momentous life and career.</p>
<p>Nargis was born on June 1, 1929 in Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Jaddan Bai &ndash; who was an institution in herself in the music and film world in 1930s and 1940s &ndash; and Abdul Rashid, said to be a prosperous Hindu from Punjab who converted to Islam. Aged only 5, she made her film debut as a child artist in Talash-e-Haq. She was given the screen name Baby Nargis. Then, in 1942, at the age of 14, Nargis appeared in a film called Tamanna as an adult.</p>
<p>She would continue to work in Hindi films and earn popularity after appearing in films like Mela with Dilip Kumar and Nur Jahan. Her true legacy, however, would be carved out only after her association with legendary actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor. Their first film was Aag (1948). They went on to work in 16 films together, six of which were produced by Raj Kapoor himself.</p>
<p>Nargis with Raj Kapoor in Awaara.</p>
<p>Their six films under RK Films banner include Aag (1948), Barsaat (1949), Awaara (1951), Aah (1953) and Shree 420 (1955). In Jagte Raho (1956) Nargis had a cameo. Their notable film, which was not produced by Raj Kapoor, was Chori Chori (1956). Aag flopped at the box office, Aah did average business but the rest of the four films did roaring business with Awaara and Shree 420 going down as two of the most iconic Hindi films of all times.</p>
<p>To a legion of fans of Hindi films, the memories of these two stars live on in the songs they featured in - Jiya beqarar hai, Barsat mein humse mile (Barsat); Ghar aaya mera pardesi, Dam bhar jo udhar munh phere (Awaara); Pyar ha ikraar hua, Ichak dana beechak dana, Sham gayi raat aayi (Shree 420); and Aa ja sanam madhur chandni mein, Pancchi banoon udti phiroon, Yeh raat bheegi bheegi (Chori Chori) - all of which are fresh in collective imagination.</p>
<p>Nargis in Awaara.</p>
<p>Watch these songs to know what passion felt like, what love could do and how desire manifested itself on the silver screen. This is particularly noteworthy given how conservative we were as a society then. Such passionate love is unmatched even today. Nargis was anything but a coy beloved - these songs show how she formed the boisterous, joyful, intense beloved to the more staid and restrained Raj Kapoor. A consummate artist that she was, it wouldn’t be hard for her to portray the de-sexualised heroine too. Her portrayal as virtuous Vidya (Shree 420) and Jagte Raho can serve as examples.</p>
<p>Also read: Salman Khan pays tribute to Wajid Khan who began, ended career with him: ‘Will always love, respect, remember you’</p>
<p>However, it was with Mehboob Khan’s Mother India that Nargis’ true legacy would be cast in stone. Playing a young bride who soon becomes a widow and goes on to bring up her two sons - played by Sunil Dutt and Rajendra Kumar - Nargis was a tour-de-force. The film not only showed the injustices society throws at those on the sidelines (in this case a young widow), it also showed Nargis as a strong and virtuous Indian woman, with a mind of her own, who kills her own son, when he goes rogue.</p>
<p>Nargis’ personal life has been of immense interest to cine-going audience in India. She was in a long relationship with the already married Raj Kapoor. She reportedly asked him to end his marriage but he refused to divorce his wife to marry her. Soon after, Nargis ended the relationship. Her Mother India co-star Sunil Dutt proposed to her and she agreed. Together, they remain one of the most loved couples of Bollywood. Nargis’ end came in 1981 after a long battle against pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Updated: Jan 26, 2020 13:29 IST</p>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan has once again reiterated that religion is not discussed at his house, adding that his children write “Indian” in forms where they need to mention their religion.</p>
<p>During his visit to the sets of Dance Plus 5 that was aired Saturday night, Shah Rukh said, “Humne koi Hindu-Musalman ki baat hi nahi ki. Meri biwi Hindu hai, mai Musalman hoon. Aur mere jo bacche hain, wo Hindustan hain.” Everyone clapped as he continued, “Jab wo school gae to school me wo bharna padta hai ki religion kya hai. To jab meri beti choti thi, usne aa ke pucha bhi mujhse ek baar, ‘papa hum kaun se religion ke hain?’ Maine usme ye likha ki hum Indian hi hain yaar, koi religion nahi hai. Aur hona bhi nahi chahiye. (We have never discussed Hindu-Muslim. My wife is Hindu, I am a Muslim and our kids are Hindustan. When they went to school, they had to write their religion. My daughter came to me once and asked ‘what is our religion?’ I simply wrote in her form that we are Indian, we do not have a religion. )</p>

<p>SRK has often insisted that religion is not imposed inside his house and they celebrate all festivals. Talking about his kids, SRK had earlier said, “I gave my son and daughter names that could pass for generic (pan-India and pan-religious) ones - Aryan and Suhana. The Khan has been bequeathed by me so they can’t really escape it.”</p>

<p>About his own religion, Shah Rukh had said, “I’m not religious in terms of reading namaz [prayer] five times but I am Islamic. I believe in the tenets of Islam and I believe that it’s a good religion and a good discipline.</p>
<p>After his films, Imtiaz Ali’s Jab Harry Met Sejal and Aanand L Rai’s Zero, failed to do well, SRK is yet to announce any film post the debacle of Zero. Nonetheless, he has a few production ventures including Abhishek Bachchan’s Bob Biswas, which went on floors earlier this week in Delhi.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-bring-my-wife-irrfan-khan-asked-me-typical">&ldquo;Can I Bring My Wife, Irrfan Khan Asked Me. Typical.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-04/q18kcmao_irrfan-khan-650_625x300_29_April_20.jpg" alt="img">
He asked me &ldquo;Can I bring my wife along?&rdquo; It was 2015 and I had called Irrfan Khan to tell him that he was NDTV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Actor of the Year&rdquo; at &ldquo;The Indian of the Year&rdquo; annual event organized by the network. I was used to long lists of demands from actors including first-class flight tickets for large entourages and was pleasantly surprised at this innocent query. His blatant delight at the news at winning the award was very endearing. This was an actor at the top of his game in India and abroad; the world was applauding his mastery of the craft. Irrfan wore his success with ease, with the hardiness of a son of the soil, genuine, authentic and always himself.</p>
<p>My earliest memories of Irrfan are from the TV series Banegi Apni Baat in the early 90&rsquo;s. He played father to grown-up kids played by actors his own age or may be a little younger. Cable TV had just come to India and Zee TV was the only Hindi general entertainment channel. I had also seen him in some of the episodes of Bharat Ek Khoj on Doordarshan. The first film starring Irrfan Khan I remember watching is Drishti; it was showing at the International Film Festival in Delhi and I bunked college to watch it. The doyen of classical Hindustani music Kishori Amonkar had turned music director for the film and I was most curious about why Dimple Kapdia would have an extra marital affair with Irrfan when Shekhar Kapur was her husband! It was in 2003&rsquo;s Maqbool that I was hit by the thunder bolt of Irrfan&rsquo;s performance and those eyes that spoke far more than all the dialogues in the film. It remains till date my most-loved Irrfan film. I never watched Haasil though much was written about Irrfan&rsquo;s performance in that film. One of his sweetest roles was in Life In A Metro (2006); among the multiple love stories in that film, Irrfan and Konkana&rsquo;s was the most lovable. His comic timing in the film was a revelation.</p>
<p>Actor Irrfan Khan died in Mumbai yesterday, leaving a void in Indian cinema and millions of broken-hearted fans</p>
<p>Irrfan did melancholy like a master of the navrasas in Mira Nair&rsquo;s Namesake. He ages most beautifully in the story of Ashoke Ganguly, a portrayal that broke my heart. I really liked him in Billu Barber, a film much publicized since it was produced by Shah Rukh Khan and he starred in it as well. The film did poorly at the box office and Irrfan got a lot of flak from the trade for it. His unease with the Bollywood setting was never more pronounced.</p>
<p>Everyone fell in love with Irrfan Khan after watching Lunchbox in 2013. The unassuming Saajan Fernandes and his loneliness didn&rsquo;t leave me for many days after watching the film. That many more felt like me was obvious in the BO numbers of this small film, his career&rsquo;s second best. 2014 was a marquee year for Irrfan. He starred in the third and final instalment of Vishal Bhardwaj&rsquo;s Shakespearian trilogy Haider. Much before Priyanka Chopra, Irrfan Khan had drawn international attention to himself with his film Warrior and on and off worked with some of the biggest names abroad. But Irrfan expressed himself best in Hindi, his language of choice. His most popular film Hindi Medium however resonated across the country, breaking language barriers.</p>
<p>The news of his sickness and the philosophical way in which he communicated it made it heartbreaking and personal for me. That his treatment took him away from his Madh Island home just as he was settling in is heartbreaking. As is the fact that he had so little time with his boys just as he was starting to enjoy parenthood. As we live homebound in this broken world, with our streaming site subscriptions watching so many Irrfans come to life, it&rsquo;s his eyes that tell us of his story, always.</p>

Actor Imran Khan married his college sweetheart Avantika Malik after dating her for eight long years in the year 2011. The couple, who is also blessed with a baby girl Imara , are drifting apart for reasons best known to them. While the actor and his wife are yet to officially confirm the same, Avantika’s recent cryptic post on the social media seems to be hinting at the same. Avantika took to her Instagram handle to share a post which read, ‘Ideal love is fostered only between two sincere, mature and independent people. Real love is not two people clinging to each other; it can only be fostered between two strong people secure in their individuality.’Earlier, Avantika’s mother reportedly confirmed that the couple is having their difference but refused reports of a possible divorce between the two.Imran has films like, ‘Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na’, ‘I Hate Luv Storys’, ‘Break Ke Baad’, ‘Mere Brother Ki Dulhan ‘and ‘Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu’ to his credit.
