<p>Most people have come to grips with the fact that NFL sophomore Jarrett Stidham will be the starting quarterback for the Patriots next season — for better or for worse.</p>
<p>However, Greg Jennings is among the few who is committed to dying on the Cam Newton hill. During Tuesday’s “First Things First” episode, the former Green Bay Packers receiver explained he believes Newton still could land in New England.</p>
<p>“I’m not closing the door on the New England Patriots,” Jennings said. “I truly believe that if this team and this staff and their medical staff could actually physically see Cam Newton … I think that they would reconsider that situation.”</p>

<p>This is a difficult situation to read.</p>
<p>On one hand, there have been numerous reports indicating Bill Belichick and the Patriots have zero interest in pursuing Newton, whom the Carolina Panthers released in late March. On the other hand, some reports have suggested a marriage remains possible.</p>
<p>As for the Patriots’ former starting quarterback, Tom Brady recently took an important step toward building relationships with his new teammates.</p>

<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/689/files/2020/04/Chenery-Aud.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
The stress never lets up. With all the serious events happening all around us, in both the nation and locally, the Kalamazoo Public Schools' budget meetings starting tonight will carry their own amount of stress, as financial decisions need to be made, under the scope and spotlight of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The meetings are scheduled for tonight (June 1st) at 7pm, tomorrow evening (June 2nd) at 7pm, and then, at 3:30pm next Monday (June 8th). Instructions for watching the hearings are listed on the KPS website homepage.</p>
<p>The pandemic and the subsequent shut down of activity in the state has created at major loss of tax revenue for the state, and locally. That shortfall will limit the amount of funding the state can provide local school districts, and this is why these meetings are taking place. In addition, June 1st is the first day for new district superintendent, Dr. Rita Raichoudhuri</p>
<p>KPS says, &ldquo;the School Aid Fund is predicted to be more than $1 billion below previous estimates for the next two years. As a result of this state shortfall, the foundation allowance that KPS receives for each student could be cut by as much as $650, resulting in a loss of approximately $8 million for the current school year and for the 2020-21 school year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By inviting as many people as want to get involved into the budget making decision process, it could potentially bring about a consensus, though it does bring with it also the potential for major disagreement.</p>
<p>While it hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned, a millage increase would also be difficult to obtain from voters, even in the best of economic times.</p>
<p>After the three scheduled meetings, the Kalamazoo Public School Board expects to have a preliminary budget to present on June 18th, and plans to vote on it on June 25th.

Green Bay Packers, Davante Adams (Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)</p>
<p>Davante Adams can cement his status as one of the Green Bay Packers’ all-time great wide receivers in 2020.</p>
<p>Davante Adams is one of the best wide receivers in the NFL currently. But in 2020, he has the chance to continue his climb up the rankings in many of the Green Bay Packers‘ all-time career receiving records.</p>
<p>Adams currently has 5,194 receiving yards in his career, which is good for 14th in franchise history.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2020 season, he has a chance to move up as high as eighth or ninth.</p>
<p>Adams has great chance to make top 10 in Packers all-time receiving yards</p>
<p>Billy Howton is currently 10th in Packers all-time receiving yards with 5,581. Adams needs just 388 more yards to overtake Howton and move into the top 10.</p>
<p>There is then a big jump up to Max McGee, who put up 6,346 receiving yards in his career with the Packers. Adams would need 1,153 receiving yards to move into ninth place by the end of the 2020 season. And that’s an achievable goal for Adams. In his last full 16-game season, he finished with 1,386 yards. He was on pace for similar numbers last season had he not missed a month due to a toe injury.</p>
<p>Currently in eighth place is Greg Jennings, who finished his Packers career with 6,537 yards. Adams would need 1,344 yards to go ahead of Jennings. Repeating his 2018 numbers would get that done this season.</p>

<p>Moving into seventh place is possible but will be challenging. Adams is currently 1,457 yards behind Antonio Freeman. He’s 1,724 yards behind Boyd Dowler. Adams will likely move ahead of both players for receiving yards in the next couple of seasons, but it will be difficult to do so in 2020.</p>
<p>Adams already in top 10 for receiving touchdowns</p>
<p>Adams has been a touchdown machine in recent seasons, finding the end zone 40 times since the start of 2016. He’s already 10th in Packers franchise history for receiving touchdowns but could move much higher in 2020.</p>
<p>If he has another double-digit touchdown season, which he’s achieved three times in the past four years, he could move as high as sixth. He needs 10 touchdown catches to overtake Jennings in sixth place, and 13 would tie Freeman’s record in fifth.

<h3 id="dont-give-up-on-marquez-valdes-scantling-yet">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Give up on Marquez Valdes-Scantling Yet&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/137/716/8716137.jpg?fit=bounds&amp;crop=1200:630,offset-y0.50&amp;width=1200&amp;height=630" alt="img">
The Packers need speed. Please bring a wide receiver to the team that can open the field. The Packers need more talent at wide receiver. If you are a Packers fan, I am sure this is what you have either said or have heard during this offseason. To be fair, the Packers have not had a receiver gain over 700 yards in a season, whose name was not Davante Adams, since Jordy Nelson in 2016. The Packers' strongest position in years past has been declining over the years, and fans are getting restless. However, the Packers have tried to address this position in 2018 when they used three draft picks at the WR position. One of those receivers was fifth-round draft pick Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Fans have been disappointed with the start of his NFL career, but it is too soon to give up on such a talented WR.</p>
<p>Valdes-Scantling joined the team in 2018 with fellow rookies J’Mon Moore and Equanimeous St. Brown. Valdes-Scantling had a strong rookie year pulling in 38 receptions for 581 yards and two touchdowns. He had the strongest rookie season out of the WR drafted and brought on high expectations for his sophomore season. The hype continued to grow after reports of him training with NFL legend Randy Moss.</p>

<p>Valdes-Scantling 2019 was a tale of two seasons. In the first half of the season, he showed the talent that he possessed. In the first seven games of the season, he had 37 targets, 21 receptions, 416 yards, and two touchdowns. That stretch also included two games with 99 and 133-yard games with a touchdown in each. However, after his season-high 133-yard game his playing time and production declined rapidly.</p>
<p>In weeks eight through 16, Valdes-Scantling only managed 19 targets, five receptions, 36 yards, and zero touchdowns. The lack of production came after his snap count slowly dwindled away. After week nine, Valdes-Scantling only played over 30% of the offensive snaps just once which came in week 11 with 37%. Fans quickly became frustrated over the lack of production, playing time, and unmet expectations.</p>
<p>Packer fans were enraged when the Packers did not address the WR position in the NFL draft this season. The Packers showed that they were committed to their WR corp as they should be. The Packers have talent in the locker room, and Valdes-Scantling might possess the most talent for any player who isn’t number 17.</p>
<p>Valdes-Scantling brings an incredible amount of speed to the Packers. He ran a 4.37 40 yard dash at the combine which is faster than Brandin Cooks, Odell Beckham, and Stefon Diggs, who are known to be explosive players. He also holds the fastest 40-yard dash at the wide receiver position for the Green Bay Packers. If Packer fans want speed on the field, they do not need to look at an outside source, Valdes-Scantling has that covered. Here is what Aaron Rodgers said in the 2019 offseason.</p>
<p>“I’m dialing in his speed. He’s so damn fast. He had one, a super deep corner today, into the wind, and I ran out of arm on that one, and I told him I wasn’t going to let that happen again, and then I overthrew him. We’ll get that dialed in.”</p>
<p>During the season, they did connect on a few big pays including a 74-yard touchdown against the Denver Broncos.</p>

<p>Packers General Manager Brian Gutekunst has been vocal on his support for Valdes-Scantling in addition to his need to step up this coming season. When talking about the WR corp, Gutekunst said that WRs usually do not come into their own until year three of their career. He mentioned players like Davante Adams and Jordy Nelson as examples. Adams doubled his production from year two to three and managed 997 yards including 12 touchdowns. Nelson, on the other hand, didn’t breakout until year four when he 582 yards to 1,263 yards. Fans could also look to Greg Jennings who posted his career-high in yards during his third season with 1,292. Gutekunst seems to be onto something with his year three theory, and Valdes-Scantling just happens to be entering year three in the league.</p>
<p>In addition to the speed and entering year three, Valdes-Scantling is also playing for the same head coach two seasons in a row for the first time in his NFL career. Since starting his collegiate career at North Carolina State, he has played games with six different head coaches from 2013 to 2020. He has been playing for different head coaches and in different offensive systems for his entire career. Year two in the same offensive system, with the same head coach and WR, will provide the consistency he has been searching for.</p>
<p>Valdes-Scantling has immense talent but has not been able to fully show his talent on the field just yet. He is entering his third season with the Green Bay Packers and knows if he wants to be on the field, he is going to need to show up to camp ready to compete. I urge Packer fans to not give up on him just yet, and let him develop in the Packers' new system. Give the young corp time to compete and come into their own. Imagine if the Packers gave up on Adams after his first two seasons.

<p>With the sports world on hold, we present a countdown of the 50 greatest moments in Wisconsin sports history over the past 50 years. This is No. 6.</p>
<p>When Brett Favre accepted his third consecutive National Football League MVP award in 1997, he had a playful message for his father and former high school football coach, Irvin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always told my dad the wishbone would never get me to pro football,&rdquo; Favre joked. &ldquo;Thanks, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irv had indeed been a disciple of the wishbone and hadn&rsquo;t let his son air it out at Hancock North Central High School in Kiln, Mississippi. Nonetheless, Brett wound up playing college football at Southern Mississippi, where Irv had played baseball years earlier.</p>
<p>Irv, who made numerous appearances in Wisconsin during his son&rsquo;s time in Green Bay and even had a role on postgame radio shows with WTMJ, had walked away from coaching in 1994 but returned in 2001 with an indoor minor-league team called the Mississippi Firedogs in Biloxi. He led the team to a 17-1 record and league championship.</p>
<p>Football was in his blood, and so was his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a fixture,&rdquo; Packers president Bob Harlan said. &ldquo;He loved to watch his son play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around 5:23 p.m. Dec. 21, 2003, the 58-year-old Irv Favre&rsquo;s 2003 Chevrolet pickup truck left the road near his home in Mississippi. He had suffered a heart attack, and though onlookers tried to revive him, he was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m. The stunning loss came one day before Brett Favre&rsquo;s Packers were scheduled to face the host Oakland Raiders on &ldquo;Monday Night Football&rdquo; in the team&rsquo;s penultimate game of the season.</p>
<p>Brett received the news when his wife, Deanna, called Packers backup quarterback Doug Pederson, who was with Brett when the call came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the pillar of his family, the rock on which it was built,&rdquo; said Brett&rsquo;s agent, James &ldquo;Bus&rdquo; Cook. &ldquo;He was a father, but he was like a brother to them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The funeral and visitation was set for Tuesday. Over the next 24 hours, the sports nation wondered whether Brett would play in a crucial late-season game across the country in California. Favre hadn&rsquo;t missed a Green Bay contest in more than 11 years, with a streak of more than 200 games played, but how could he possibly play Monday given the gravity of the loss?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, the organization is just very saddened,&rdquo; Harlan said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a terrible story. As much as we knew Irvin, and you know how we feel about Brett and Deanna, there&rsquo;s great, great sorry and sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Favre not only played, he delivered the single greatest performance of his legendary career with the Packers. With a national TV audience acutely aware of the quarterback&rsquo;s grief, Favre threw for 399 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-7 dismantling of the Raiders.</p>
<p>Part of the family</p>

<p>It bears repeating how much Favre meant to Packers fans. Yes, there was the messy and sometimes surreal rift that developed between the organization and the player after his departure in 2008, not to mention his decision to join the Vikings in 2009. The fences have been mended since, and he&rsquo;s back among the most popular figures in Wisconsin sports history, just as he was in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Favre had, of course, piloted the Packers to two Super Bowls and one title, with eight playoff appearances in the preceding decade as the team navigated through the 2003 season (and three more playoff appearances to follow). He&rsquo;d played in 204 consecutive games heading into the Oakland battle, including playoffs, and no quarterback had done that before. He was on his way to several more records in his career, but just as importantly, he was the free-wheeling gunslinger whose flair for the dramatic and aw-shucks air made him intensely endearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brett Favre is this tough quarterback who&rsquo;s indestructible,&rdquo; Packers coach Mike Sherman said. &ldquo;He showed a very vulnerable side and shared that with them. On the same lines the team showed a side of themselves toward him, a very caring, consoling side to help him through his grief, and I think that culminated with the way they took the field against Oakland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2003, though, the 8-6 Packers were in a tough spot, needing to finish with a flourish and get some help from other teams to crack into the playoffs. The Packers schedule closed with Oakland on the road and Denver at Lambeau Field.</p>
<p>Favre didn&rsquo;t leave his Berkeley hotel after hearing of Irv&rsquo;s passing. His family encouraged Brett to stay and take the field the next night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been around people who have lost a family member, lost someone close to them, and they say that person is there watching, or you know, angels, whatever,&rdquo; Favre said the following week. &ldquo;I would say two weeks ago I didn&rsquo;t really believe in that, but I think we better start believing in something because the odds were against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Favre finished the game with a 154.9 passing rating, the highest of his career. While he had battled through injuries to his thumb, knees, hip and elbow during his career, not to mention the removal of 30 inches of intestine days after a serious car accident in college, he&rsquo;d never faced this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no road map for this, this is the right way to handle it, this is the wrong way to handle it, this is how you do it,&rdquo; ABC commentator John Madden said during the broadcast. &ldquo;It is something that has to shock you. How Brett Favre is going to handle this, I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker, Ferguson and Walls</p>

<p>Favre completed his first nine passes. Two plays after a rainbow 47-yarder to Robert Ferguson, Favre threw a flawless pass off his back foot to the corner of the end zone for a 22-yard Wesley Walls touchdown. Favre jumped into the arms of his offensive linemen, a familiar move for the exuberant quarterback, and was now tied for second all-time with Fran Tarkenton in career touchdown passes.</p>
<p>Later in the first half, Favre was alone in second place after a 23-yard pass to Javon Walker. Only Dan Marino had more.</p>
<p>When Favre hurried a heave into the end zone from midfield and Walker came down with a leaping catch in double coverage for a touchdown, the Packers had a 24-7 lead. That score had been set up by a 27-yard sideline circus catch from Ferguson. Raiders cornerback Phillip Buchanon was the primary victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a Favre day,&rdquo; Buchanon said. &ldquo;He did some great things on &lsquo;Monday Night Football.&rsquo; He made some great throws and I did some bad technique things. &hellip; It was a nightmare game for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker made another absurd catch in traffic for 43 yards just before halftime, setting up a 6-yard touchdown pass to David Martin. With four catches for 124 yards, Walker delivered what is certainly his most memorable game as a member of the Packers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t draw up a script better than that,&rdquo; Sherman said. &ldquo;You hoped he&rsquo;d play that type of game, but the chances of that happening, unless it&rsquo;s Brett Favre, are unlikely. This guy put together a career day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first half alone, Favre completed 15 of 18 for 311 yards.</p>
<p>The week that followed</p>

<p>Ahman Green added the lone second-half touchdown for either team, but by then the game had become anticlimactic. The Packers were on their way to a 9-6 record and 5-3 road record for the year, matching their best showing since 1972.</p>
<p>Still, the Packers looked like they were on the outside of the playoff picture. When New Orleans beat Dallas during the first round of games the following week, it closed off the wild-card possibility for Green Bay, meaning the Packers' only way into the postseason was a win over Denver and a Minnesota loss to three-win Arizona.</p>
<p>The Cardinals had beaten the Packers in Week 3, but a Minnesota loss still looked like a longshot. Favre flew to Mississippi after the Oakland game for Irv&rsquo;s funeral and returned to the team by Friday to cram for the Denver game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a close team to begin with and now it appears we&rsquo;re even closer because of this,&rdquo; Sherman said. &ldquo;And so adversity does bring out sometimes the best in you and sometimes the worst. With this team, it&rsquo;s brought out the best in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This one wasn&rsquo;t a contest, either. Green Bay throttled Denver, 31-3. At Sherman&rsquo;s request, the Minnesota-Arizona game wasn&rsquo;t displayed on the Lambeau scoreboard during the game, but everyone knew what happened in the desert, anyway.</p>
<p>Nate Poole&rsquo;s ridiculous catch as time expired gave the Cardinals a thrilling 17-16 victory, giving the Packers the NFC North crown. Green Bay would later give Poole a key to the city and invite him to the Packers' playoff game the following week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said after the game Monday night, I felt like he was watching,&rdquo; Favre said. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s going on here. My emotions right now, I&rsquo;m numb, to be honest with you. I&rsquo;ve cried as many tears as I could possibly cry. And I&rsquo;m so proud of this team and what we&rsquo;ve been able to overcome. A lot of people were concerned about our emotions coming out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just in the locker room, and everyone is cheering, and I said it&rsquo;s hard to cheer because this is so unbelievable. It&rsquo;s beyond my comprehension. I have never been a part of anything like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Favre led the league in passing touchdowns for the fourth time in his career with 32, and his seventh 30-touchdown season was the most for any quarterback. When he was removed midway through the fourth quarter for Pederson, Lambeau Field gave him a standing ovation.</p>
<p>How the moment lives on</p>

<p>Favre played in memorable games thereafter, including NFC Championship Game appearances with Green Bay and Minnesota. But nothing topped the single-game excellence of the Oakland game.</p>
<p>The Packers were immersed in an unforgettable four-week stretch. In the playoff opener against Seattle, the Packers won in overtime on Al Harris' pick-six against Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. A week after that, the Packers lost in overtime to Philadelphia in the infamous &ldquo;4th-and-26&rdquo; game.</p>
<p>Green Bay went back to the playoffs in the 2004 season, but Sherman was fired after going 4-12 in 2005. The organization hired Mike McCarthy, and a new era of Packers greatness began almost immediately, including with Favre in the 2007 run to the NFC Championship Game.</p>
<p>Fans may have been frustrated with Favre during his acrimonious departure (or the organization for letting it happen), but he&rsquo;s once again one of the most beloved figures in Wisconsin sports. When he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016, you better believe highlights from the Oakland game were in ample supply.</p>
<p>Favre&rsquo;s record streak of 297 games played didn&rsquo;t end until long after he&rsquo;d left Green Bay, in 2010.</p>

<p>Which Brett Favre moments in a Packers uniform are your favorite?</p>
<p>Sept. 20, 1992 — Favre replaces an injured Don Majkowski to make his Green Bay debut and leads his team to a 24-23 win over the Bengals after being down 14 points. He capped it with a touchdown pass to Kitrick Taylor.</p>
<p>January 8, 1994 — In his first playoff game, Favre uncorked a 40-yard touchdown pass to Sterling Sharpe with 55 seconds left, and the Packers prevailed in Detroit, 28-24, for their first playoff win in 11 years.</p>
<p>Dec. 18, 1994 — Favre plunged into the end zone on a 9-yard rush with 3 seconds left for a 21-17 win over the Falcons in the final Packers game ever at Milwaukee County Stadium. The Packers finished 9-7 and advanced to the playoffs, with another first-round win over the Lions.</p>
<p>Nov. 12, 1995 — Favre throws five touchdown passes despite a badly injured ankle, including a fourth-quarter touchdown to Edgar Bennett that accounts for the winning points in a 35-28 win over the Bears.</p>
<p>Jan. 6, 1996 — Green Bay enjoyed a breakthrough to the NFC Championship Game with an uplifting win over San Francisco in the divisional round, 27-17. Favre threw first-half touchdown passes to Keith Jackson and Mark Chmura.</p>
<p>Jan. 12, 1997 — Favre completed 19 of 29 passes for two touchdowns as the Packers carved up Carolina, 30-13, and returned to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1968.</p>
<p>Jan. 26, 1997 — Favre passed for 246 yards and two touchdowns, including a 54-yard bomb to Andre Rison on the second Packers play from scrimmage to help Green Bay win their first Super Bowl in nearly three decades, a 35-21 win over New England.</p>
<p>Sept. 26, 1999 — Favre&rsquo;s game-winning 23-yard touchdown pass to Corey Bradford for a 23-yard touchdown with 12 seconds remaining beat the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>Nov. 6, 2000 — On a rainy Monday Night against the Vikings, Favre lofted a pass in overtime that appeared incomplete, but Antonio Freeman reeled it in, stood up and ran to the house for a 43-yard game-winning score, prompting announcer Al Michaels to scream, &ldquo;He did WHAT?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sept. 30, 2007 — Favre&rsquo;s 16-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings set the new NFL career passing touchdown record, passing Dan Marino&rsquo;s count of 420. Favre finished with 508, now in fourth behind Drew Brees (547), Tom Brady (541) and Peyton Manning (539).</p>
<p>Oct. 29, 2007 — On the first play of overtime against the Broncos, Favre hit Greg Jennings for an 82-yard touchdown pass that gave the Packers a walk-off win.</p>
<p>Dec. 16, 2007 — With a 7-yard touchdown pass to Donald Driver, Favre set the NFL career passing record, bypassing Dan Marino&rsquo;s mark of 61,361 yards. Favre finished his career with 71,838, a mark that has since been passed by Brees, Brady and Manning.</p>
<p>Rules of the 50 in 50 series</p>
<p>Moments are recorded over the 50-year window from 1970 to 2019 (sorry 2020, but you&rsquo;re disqualified)</p>
<p>These are moments and not achievements, although that largely goes hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>These are &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; 50 moments, so you won&rsquo;t see moments that are pivotal but ultimately heartbreaking (like the NFC Championship loss to Seattle, Kareem getting traded, etc.)</p>
<p>You also won&rsquo;t see (many) moments that came to be recognized for their greatness later, such as the day the Bucks drafted Giannis Antetokounmpo or the day the Packers traded for Brett Favre.</p>
<p>Moments considered include teams based in Wisconsin and Wisconsin athletes competing in individual sports or as part of national teams (such as the Olympics), or moments on Wisconsin soil.</p>
<p>These are singular moments. You&rsquo;re supposed to remember where you were when they happened.</p>
