<p>Acer notebook sales are soaring worldwide so much so that the local subsidiary is totally out of stock with the models that were shipped now on retailers’ shelves.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese laptop maker Acer saw its notebook sales in Canada and the US jump 105 percent and 135 percent, respectively, on year in March 2020 in Australia first quarter sales are also up according to local CEO Darren Simons who expects to see new stock in June July.</p>
<p>His May shipments have already been sold to retailers, also in demand are Acer monitors.</p>
<p>Globally, Acer’s consumer monitor sales grew 17.1 percent on year in the month and it has a 20 percent share in the gaming monitor market.</p>
<p>Taiwan-based Digitimes Research has predicted that Acer notebook shipments will increase by 1.5 million units or 77 percent in Q2, driven by sales of Chromebooks and gaming notebooks.</p>
<p>It estimated global notebook shipments to climb over 40 percent in 2Q20 due to demand arising from remote work, online learning, and other lockdown activities.</p>
<p>In other Taiwanese PC News, Micro-Star International Co (MSI) a leading maker of PC motherboards, graphics cards and gaming computers, announced over the weekend that its board of directors has approved distributing a cash dividend of NT$4.2 per share this year, less than the NT$5 per share the company paid last year.</p>
<p>he proposed dividend represents a payout ratio of 63.54 percent based on last year’s earnings per share of NT$6.61.</p>
<p>It also suggests a dividend yield of 4.51 percent based on the stock’s closing price of NT$93 yesterday.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the company would benefit from new chips launched by Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc later this year. In the first quarter of this year, the company reported that revenue decreased 3.34 percent year-on-year to US$956.3 million.

<h3 id="who-vote-on-taiwan-chinas-npc-convenes-and-fujifilm-earnings">&ldquo;WHO vote on Taiwan, China&rsquo;s NPC convenes and Fujifilm earnings&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F3%2F7%2F3%2F9%2F26889373-1-eng-GB%2FRTSFHNF.JPG?source=nar-cms&amp;width=1024&amp;height=512&amp;fit=cover&amp;gravity=faces" alt="img">
Welcome to Nikkei Asian Preview.</p>
<p>The week will open with the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, where countries are slated to vote on the highly-charged issue of whether to include Taiwan as an observer &ndash; a move strongly opposed by Beijing. The vote should produce some interesting mood music for major political events later in the week: the National People&rsquo;s Congress in Beijing and President Tsai Ing-wen&rsquo;s inauguration for a second term in Taipei.</p>
<p>Economic data will come from Japan with quarterly GDP on Monday and Hong Kong with monthly unemployment on Tuesday. The fourth stage of India&rsquo;s nationwide lockdown also begins this week, while central banks in Indonesia and Thailand will hold monetary policy meetings. Annual results are expected from two Japanese companies in the news &ndash; SoftBank Group and Avigan maker Fujifilm Holdings.</p>
<p>Keep up with our reporting by following us on Twitter @NAR.</p>
<p>MONDAY</p>
<p>WHO decision-making body meets</p>
<p>The World Health Assembly gathers on Monday to discuss the coronavirus, but all eyes will be on the Taiwan vote. Although Taiwan has &ldquo;extremely slim&rdquo; odds of success, the vote will be seen as a referendum on China&rsquo;s influence as a crisis that originated within its borders continues to plague member states.</p>
<p>The pros: Eight countries, including the U.S. and Japan, have expressed support for Taiwan&rsquo;s inclusion in the WHA. Taiwan has earned plaudits for its response and containment of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The maybes: Any country that counts China as its largest trading partner is in the crosshairs. Even a few votes more than the expected minimum of 22 states in Taiwan&rsquo;s favor would send a message to Beijing.</p>
<p>Huawei marks a year on U.S. blacklist</p>
<p>Huawei Technologies&rsquo; annual three-day global analysts&rsquo; summit will be streamed from the Shenzhen headquarters starting on Monday. The summit, where the Chinese tech giant typically shows off its latest innovations, coincides with the first anniversary of its addition to the U.S. Entity List, restricting its access to American technologies. U.S. President Donald Trump last week extended the ban on purchases of Chinese-made telecoms equipment by American carriers.</p>
<p>Red flag for SoftBank results</p>
<p>SoftBank Group has already warned of a 900 billion yen ($8.4 billion) loss for the fiscal year ended March, its largest ever loss, as the coronavirus pandemic hit its investment portfolio hard. With the virus&rsquo;s end still out of sight, analysts will be watching whether Masayoshi Son, SoftBank&rsquo;s billionaire founder and chairman, will maintain his aggressive investment strategy.</p>
<p>Signals from Thailand&rsquo;s economic planners</p>
<p>Thailand&rsquo;s National Economic and Social Development Council is scheduled to announce gross domestic product for the quarter ending March. Southeast Asia&rsquo;s second largest economy has likely shrunk year-on-year over the three months, due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand expects that the economy will further contract in the second quarter. In a policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday, the central bank may move to support the economy by easing its monetary policy for the third time since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Bellwether trade data from Singapore</p>
<p>April trade statistics from Singapore will be an indicator of how the coronavirus lockdowns has affected the movement of goods in the region. For Singapore&rsquo;s small and open economy, disruptions in its top five trading partners &ndash; China, Malaysia, the U.S., the European Union and Taiwan &ndash; could deal a critical blow.</p>
<p>Will Alibaba appear on the Hang Seng Index?</p>
<p>Hang Seng Indexes will decide whether to include Alibaba Group, Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi in Hong Kong&rsquo;s main share indexes. The decision will follow debate over whether the benchmark Hang Seng Index and Hang Seng China Enterprises Index should allow companies with different share classes and secondary-listed companies. If approved, the move would follow HKEX&rsquo;s decision in 2018 to loosen its requirements, paving the way for Alibaba to list in Hong Kong in late 2019.</p>
<p>TUESDAY</p>
<p>Quarterly results from Baidu</p>
<p>Nasdaq-listed Baidu will release January-March quarterly earnings on Tuesday. The Chinese search engine giant&rsquo;s efforts to strengthen its mobile search engine and AI technologies are expected to have catalyzed top-line growth. Baidu&rsquo;s revenues were up 6% year-on-year to 28.9 billion yuan ($4.15 billion) in the previous quarter, but the coronavirus drag on China&rsquo;s economy has weighed on advertising.</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Results from Lenovo and Xiaomi</p>
<p>Supply disruptions in the March quarter have affected Lenovo Group, the world&rsquo;s largest notebook computer maker, as much as competitors HP, Dell, Acer and Asustek Computer. But the global spike in telework, gaming and entertainment has driven laptop demand to a record high this quarter, which may buoy Lenovo&rsquo;s first quarter results on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Less rosy results will come on the same day from Xiaomi. The world&rsquo;s No. 4 smartphone company has been hit hard by lockdown measures in Southeast Asia and India, where Xiaomi&rsquo;s manufacturing partners have been ordered to suspend production.</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s presidential inauguration</p>
<p>For her second and final inauguration, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen will have a simple ceremony due to the coronavirus. Although Taiwan is expected to lose in its push for observer status in the World Health Assembly due to Beijing&rsquo;s pressure, Tsai&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic has helped her popularity &ndash; not only domestically but also internationally. Look for cross-strait relations to remain frosty under a second Tsai administration.</p>

<p>FRIDAY</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s two sessions convene</p>
<p>After two months of virus-induced delay, China will convene its largest annual political gatherings. The &ldquo;two sessions&rdquo; will kick off on Thursday with the Chinese People&rsquo;s Political Consultative Conference, followed by the National People&rsquo;s Congress the next day.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s on the agenda? The government will lay out policy directions and the economic outlook, as the country grapples with challenges wrought by the coronavirus. The NPC will also deliberate the national budget and legislative bills, both newly proposed and those ripe for revision, including laws on biosecurity and animal epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>Who will be there? Some 5,000 lawmakers, businesspeople and government officials from across the country will descend on Beijing for the two sessions, which will last for about a week &ndash; shorter than last year&rsquo;s 13-day event.</p>

<p>Quarterly results from China&rsquo;s e-commerce giants</p>
<p>New York-listed Alibaba Group Holding will report January-March earnings on Friday. The Chinese conglomerate, whose business spans from e-commerce to finance and technology, has observed mixed results from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>On one hand, demand for Alibaba&rsquo;s online retail, teleconference and cloud computing services has skyrocketed amid lockdown measures. On the other hand, Alibaba&rsquo;s ability to capture that demand may have been curtailed by delivery workers and engineers stranded at home for weeks.</p>
<p>Pinduoduo, which trails Alibaba and JD.com, will also report earnings on Friday. The Nasdaq-listed company&rsquo;s revenue growth has missed Wall Street estimates for two quarters in a row.</p>
<p>Hong Kong trade shows resume</p>
<p>Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre is scheduled to host its first event, a wedding fair, since the onset of the coronavirus crisis in late January. The city, however, reported a handful of new COVID-19 cases after three weeks of no infections, following the relaxation of social distancing measures. A spokesman for HKCEC said the event could be rescheduled &ldquo;depending on government regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Year-end results from Avigan maker Fujifilm</p>
<p>Mainly known as a camera and medical equipment maker, Fujifilm Holdings&rsquo; reputation as a pharmaceutical company has risen with the potential of its antiviral drug Avigan as a coronavirus treatment. Investors will be watching for updates on the drug&rsquo;s production and a financial windfall as the Japanese government boosts its stockpile of Avigan and fulfills supply requests from other countries.

<h3 id="taiwan-april-export-orders-unexpectedly-rise-on-explosive-telecommuting-demand">&ldquo;Taiwan April export orders unexpectedly rise on &lsquo;explosive&rsquo; telecommuting demand&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2020-05-20T090417Z_1_GF2_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG?2037275364" alt="img">
By Yimou Lee</p>
<p>TAIPEI, May 20 (Reuters) - Taiwan&rsquo;s April export orders unexpectedly grew for a second consecutive month fuelled by strong demand for telecommuting products such as laptops amid the coronavirus outbreak that has kept millions of people around the world at home.</p>
<p>Export orders for Taiwan, seen as a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 2.3% from a year earlier to $38.53 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Wednesday. Economists in a Reuters poll had estimated orders would drop 3% compared with 4.3% growth in March.</p>
<p>The ministry, which has repeatedly warned of a difficult outlook for Taiwan&rsquo;s orders due to the impact from the coronavirus, said the pandemic had sparked &ldquo;explosive&rdquo; demand for products including laptops and tablets, boosting orders for the island&rsquo;s electronics industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The virus outbreak has led to explosive telecommuting business opportunities. Demand for laptop, tablets and telecommunication products were strong,&rdquo; Huang Yu-ling, director of the ministry&rsquo;s statistics agency, told reporters.</p>
<p>However, the ministry warned of uncertainties over the bumpy global recovery from the pandemic and renewed U.S.-China trade tensions that could curb growth momentum in the coming months.</p>
<p>The ministry said it expects May export orders to be in a range of a 1.9% decline and 2% growth from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s manufacturers, a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Huawei Technologies HWT.UL, have been hit by slowing global demand for electronics as containment measures in many countries force shoppers to stay home.</p>
<p>Foxconn 2317.TW, the world&rsquo;s largest contract electronics maker, last week saw its first-quarter profit plunge to its lowest in two decades after the pandemic forced the Taiwanese firm to suspend manufacturing operations in China and hurt demand from customers including Apple.</p>
<p>April orders from the United States rose 6.8% from a year earlier, compared with 9.1% growth in March. Orders from China were up 9.2% versus a 7.5% gain the previous month. European orders climbed 7.6% while those from Japan fell 4.7%.</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s government has repeatedly warned of uncertainty for the economy, and is rolling out an economic stimulus package it expects will eventually be worth T$1.05 trillion ($35.01 billion).</p>
<p>Economic growth slowed to its weakest in nearly four years in the first quarter as the pandemic crimped domestic consumption and tourism.</p>

Shipments forecast cut on virus disruptions in China</p>
<p>LOWERING EXPECTATIONS: A market research firm said shipments this quarter would fall significantly, but that the memory industry would survive unscathed</p>
<p>By Natasha Li / Staff reporter</p>
<p>High-tech industries worldwide are facing labor shortages and shipping restrictions from an outbreak of COVID-19 in China, with hardware manufacturers bearing the brunt of the effects, TrendForce Corp (集邦科技) said in a report yesterday, as it cut its shipments forecast for this quarter.</p>
<p>Lacking key components such as batteries and printed circuit boards due to an overall delay in Chinese production, downstream original design manufacturers (ODM) for consumer electronics would see a decrease in production, the Taipei-based market researcher said.</p>
<p>As a result, TrendForce cut its shipments outlook for laptops, LCD TVs and monitors by 12.3 percent, 4.5 percent and 5.2 percent respectively to 30.7 million, 46.6 million and 27.5 million units this quarter, compared with a previous forecast of 35 million, 48.8 million and 29 million units, the researcher said.</p>
<p>Contract laptop maker Quanta Computer Inc (廣達電腦) yesterday posted a 25.9 percent drop year-on-year in revenue to NT$62.96 billion (US$2.1 billion) for last month, with laptop shipments of 2 million units, as the Lunar New Year holiday reduced working days.</p>
<p>Contract electronics manufacturer Wistron Corp (緯創) said it shipped 1 million laptops last month, while revenue fell 20.13 percent annually to NT$40.49 billion.</p>
<p>Shipments of other consumer electronics, especially smart devices, also face challenges as ODMs grapple with shortages in labor, passive components and camera lenses, TrendForce said, adding that there would be an estimated 12 percent year-on-year decline in overall production this quarter to 275 million units, a five-year low.</p>
<p>Total smartphone shipments this year are set to fall by 1.3 percent on an annual basis to 1.38 billion units, it said, adding that it might further trim the figure due to uncertainties over the outbreak.</p>
<p>The researcher also predicted declines in shipments of game consoles and smart speakers for this quarter to 6.2 million and 23.2 million units respectively, falling by more than 10 percent each from last month’s forecast of 6.9 million and 26.4 million units.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and traffic constraints in China have left upstream suppliers, such as semiconductor companies and display panel makers, with an increasingly severe shortage of factor workers as they struggle to resume production, the report said.</p>
<p>Chinese foundry firms are likely to see lower factory utilization this quarter as a result, affecting China’s IC packaging and testing companies further down the stream, TrendForce said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the memory industry has mostly been spared from the outbreak, as its Chinese production remains unhindered due to its high level of automation, the researcher said, adding that DRAM prices would nevertheless increase this quarter, owing to insufficient inventory among end clients.

Working at home triggers demand for chips, laptops</p>
<p>SOCIAL DISTANCING: China’s cloud infrastructure buildup has helped push up prices, with spot prices of DRAM chips rising more than 6 percent since Feb. 20</p>
<p>Reuters, SEOUL and TOKYO</p>
<p>With more employees working from home to help slow the spread of COVID-19, demand is surging for laptops and network peripherals, as well as components along the supply chain such as chips, as companies rush to build virtual offices.</p>
<p>Many firms have withdrawn earnings forecasts, anticipating a drop in consumer demand and an economic slump, but a better performance at electronics retailers and chipmakers is hinting at benefits from the shift in work culture.</p>
<p>Over the past month, governments and companies globally have been advising people to stay safe indoors. Over the same period, South Korea — home of the world’s biggest memorychip maker, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd — yesterday reported a 20 percent jump in semiconductor exports.</p>
<p>Pointing to further demand, nearly one in three Americans have been ordered to stay home, while Italy has banned internal travel.</p>
<p>“With more people working and learning from home during the outbreak, there has been rising demand for Internet services &hellip; meaning data centers need bigger pipes to carry the traffic,” Cape Investment &amp; Securities Co analyst Park Sung-soon said.</p>
<p>A South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy official said that cloud computing has boosted sales of server chips, “while an increase in telecommuting in the United States and China has also been a main driver of huge server demand.”</p>
<p>In Japan, laptop maker Dynabook Inc reported brisk demand which it partly attributed to companies encouraging teleworking.</p>
<p>Rival NEC Corp said that it has responded to demand by adding more teleworking-friendly features, such as more powerful embedded speakers.</p>
<p>Australian electronics retailer JB Hifi Ltd also said that it has seen an “acceleration” in demand from both commercial and retail customers for “essential products they need to respond to and prepare” for the coronavirus, such as devices that support remote working, as well as home appliances.</p>
<p>China is leading chip demand, analysts said, as cloud service providers such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (阿里巴巴), Tencent Holdings Ltd (騰訊) and Baidu Inc (百度) responded to Beijing’s efforts to contain the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Cloud companies opened their platforms, allowing new and existing customers to use more resources for free to help maintain operations,” Canalys analyst Wong Yih Khai said. “This set the precedent for technology companies around the world that offer cloud-based services in their response to helping organizations affected by coronavirus.”</p>
<p>China’s cloud infrastructure buildup has helped push up chip prices, with spot prices of DRAM chips rising more than 6 percent since Feb. 20, data from price tracker DRAMeXchange showed.</p>
<p>UBS Group AG last week forecast average contract prices of DRAM chips to rise as much as 10 percent quarter-on-quarter in the second, led by a more than 20 percent jump in server chips.</p>
<p>It said it expects DRAM chips to be modestly undersupplied until the third quarter of next year, with demand from server customers rising 31 percent both this year and next year.</p>
<p>Concerns over supply disruption have also contributed to a price rise.</p>
<p>“You’ve got lots of OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and systems integrators in the global market who have intense demand for memory now,” said Andrew Perlmutter, chief strategy officer at ITRenew, a company that buys and reworks used data center equipment for resale. “Nobody is shutting down their factories — it is still production as normal — but people worry about memory supply in particular, so they want to get out ahead of production.”</p>
<p>About 69 percent of electronics manufacturers have flagged possible supplier delays averaging three weeks, a March 13 poll by industry trade group IPC International showed.</p>
<p>Half of those polled expected business to normalize by July, while nearly three-quarters pointed to at least October.

Holiday, virus affect Compal sales</p>
<p>By Natasha Li / Staff reporter</p>
<p>Contract electronics maker Compal Electronics Inc (仁寶電腦) reported that revenue last month dropped 27.31 percent from a year earlier to NT$39.51 billion (US$1.32 billion), with laptop shipments falling more than 30 percent to 1.6 million units.</p>
<p>The decline was mainly due to an extended Lunar New Year holiday and production disruptions at its factories in China because of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Revenue in the first two months of this year plunged 18.64 percent year-on-year to NT$101.27 billion, Compal said on Monday, adding that production in China has resumed to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Rival maker Quanta Computer Inc (廣達電腦) also saw revenue decline 21.74 percent from a year earlier to NT$49.19 billion, with laptop shipments falling more 40 percent to 1.1 million units due to production disruptions in China.</p>
<p>Quanta has since the fourth quarter of 2018 been shifting production from China to a plant in New Taipei City and has started setting up manufacturing facilities in Thailand.</p>
<p>Wistron Corp (緯創) last month saw its revenue contract 21.09 percent year-on-year to NT$44.86 billion, with laptop shipments dropping 15 percent to 850,000 units.</p>
<p>The firm also saw a double-digit decline in shipments of desktops, while server shipments remained stable, it said yesterday.</p>
<p>Having already resumed about 60 percent of its Chinese production, the company said it expects to reach full production by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Wistron, which also assembles older models of Apple Inc’s iPhone in India, said that production in the country remains largely intact.</p>
<p>Another Apple supplier, Pegatron Corp (和碩), which is reportedly to produce a next generation iPhone SE, fared better than its peers, with sales last month inching up 0.2 percent annually to NT$81.8 billion.</p>
<p>The company’s main manufacturing site in Shanghai has seen production mostly spared by the coronavirus, while its Kunshan plant has since recovered more than 60 percent of production, market watchers said.
