<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed fatherly pride, a day after learning his daughter Chiara was among the hundreds of protesters arrested during Saturday night demonstrations against police brutality, which fanned out across the city and at times resulted in violent encounters with police.</p>
<p>“I love my daughter deeply. I honor her. She is such a good human being. She only wants to do good in the world,” de Blasio said Monday during a press conference on Monday morning, a day after a third day of protests ended in looting, vandalism and violent scuffles with police.</p>
<p>“She wants to see a better and more peaceful world. She believes a lot of change is needed. I&rsquo;m proud of her that she cares so much and she was willing to go out there and do something about it,” de Blasio added.</p>
<p>The mayor, who for days has struggled to hone a message of solidarity with those protesting police brutality while also standing by the biggest police force in the nation, said he did not learn about his daughter’s arrest until the press asked his aides about it on Sunday night.</p>
<p>“She&rsquo;s 25 years old and did not inform Chirlane and I [of] have her intention to get arrested,”de Blasio said. “I knew of some of her views. I knew she believed in peaceful protest. I knew she had participated a few nights ago, but in a peaceful manner.”</p>
<p>Sources tell NY1 Chiara, 25, was arrested Saturday night near the intersection of 12th Street and Broadway along with approximately 100 other demonstrators who were blocking the road and throwing “unknown objects” in the direction of police.</p>
<p>Sources said Chiara was given a desk appearance ticket for disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>De Blasio, who has made his biracial family a centerpiece of his political career, defended the actions of his daughter, saying she told him that she was peacefully protesting but was placed under arrest.</p>
<p>“I admire that she was out there trying to change something that she thought was unjust and doing it in a peaceful manner,” de Blasio said “It&rsquo;s a reality that every parent faces that you never know when your kids become adults, how they&rsquo;re going to go about their lives. Sometimes you get surprises.”</p>
<p>De Blasio’s two children and his wife, Chirlane McCray, have played a big role in his political career, but Chiara has been the more private of the two children.</p>
<p>It was de Blasio’s ad featuring his then teenage son, Dante de Blasio, that helped to catapult his 2013 campaign to victory on the message of police reform and inequality.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, as news of Chiara’s arrest was reported, the Sergeant’s Benevolent Association, a law enforcement union that frequently spars with the mayor, tweeted a photo of the arrest record, which also revealed personal details about the First Daughter.</p>
<p>Twitter quickly removed the Tweet because it violated the social media’s company’s rules. The mayor was critical of the union, which has often accused him of not siding with police officers.</p>
<p>“The SBA did something unconscionable and it&rsquo;s not just cause it&rsquo;s my daughter,” de Blasio said. They do this all the time with people&rsquo;s privacy. This is another one of the things that has to change. Look, police unions could be part of the change and the improvement in the city and this country.”

He said his daughter told him she didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.&ldquo;She was very clear that she believed she was following the instructions of police officers and doing what they were asking&hellip; absolutely, she was abundantly clear she was peacefully protesting, not doing anything that would provoke a negative response,&rdquo; he said at a media briefing, adding that he admired her for peacefully &ldquo;trying to change something that she thought was unjust.&ldquo;Although the arrest was a shock to Mayor de Blasio and his wife, &ldquo;I want to tell her how much I love and respect and admire her.&ldquo;When asked by Eyewitness News if he thought his daughter did anything wrong, the mayor said emphatically, &ldquo;No.&ldquo;Largely peaceful George Floyd protests around the city on Saturday gave way to scattered clashes between police and protesters later in the evening.Demonstrators smashed shop windows, threw objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads.The mayor blamed much of the violence on a small group of well-organized &ldquo;anarchists.&ldquo;PHOTOS: George Floyd protests erupt into violence in NYC &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-

Chiara de Blasio, the 25-year-old daughter of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Bill de BlasioScience says: &lsquo;Open the schools&rsquo; De Blasio&rsquo;s daughter arrested in NYC protest: reports &lsquo;Mr. President, the nation needs to hear from you&rsquo; MORE (D), was arrested during a protest in the city over the weekend, according to local reports.</p>
<p>The New York Post and WABC, both citing local law enforcement sources, reported on Sunday that the mayor’s daughter was arrested for unlawful assembly the night before. She was allegedly arrested after she and other protesters refused to unblock a street in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The demonstration on late Saturday came as the city entered a third day of protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week shortly after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>According to The New York Times, hundreds of people have been arrested following a string of demonstrations in the region, some of which involved looting and arson.</p>
<p>Shortly after his daughter was arrested, Bill de Blasio reportedly called for protesters “to go home” during a press conference on late Saturday.</p>
<p>“We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but now it is time for people to go home. &hellip; If you went out peacefully to make a point about the need for change, you have been heard and change is coming in the city. I have no doubt about that. It’s time to go home so we can all move forward,” he said then, according to the Post.</p>
<p>He also reportedly took aim at some protesters he said have an “explicit agenda of violence” in remarks on Sunday, the paper reported.</p>
<p>“It is a small number of people. It is well organized, even though many of the people are associated with the anarchist movement,” he said earlier.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio&rsquo;s 25-year-old daughter was arrested for unlawful assembly Saturday night, according to the city&rsquo;s Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information. Chiara de Blasio was at a protest in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>The New York Post obtained an arrest report saying she refused to leave a Manhattan street that officers ordered cleared because people were throwing things.</p>
<p>Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn&rsquo;t mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing.</p>
<p>It was one of hundreds of arrests at protests in the city over the weekend, CBS New York reports.</p>
<p>The demonstration Chiara attended was among countless ones around the country over the fatal arrest of George Floyd.</p>
<p>While many other cities have imposed curfews in response to protests, Bill de Blasio has insisted New York doesn&rsquo;t need one.</p>
<p>At the press briefing, De Blasio praised police for showing &ldquo;restraint&rdquo; Saturday evening. But he also criticized the actions of some officers he said showed &ldquo;a callous disregard for fellow New Yorkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like what I saw one bit. I never want to see something like that. I don&rsquo;t want to see anything like that again. We need to do a full investigation and look at the actions of those officers and see what was done, why it was done, how it could&rsquo;ve been done differently,&rdquo; the mayor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I also want to emphasize that situation was created by a group of protesters blocking and surrounding a police vehicle, a tactic that we had seen before in the last few days, a tactic that can be very very dangerous to everyone involved. And we&rsquo;ve seen direct attacks on police officers, including in their vehicles.&rdquo;</p>
