<p>Good news for fans of The Mandalorian and Star Wars Rebels. Hasbro has revealed several new waves of Star Wars: The Black Series action figures featuring bounty hunter Din Djarin aka the Mandalorian and the entire main cast of Rebels, including fan-favorite heroine Ahsoka Tano.</p>
<p>Star Wars: Ahsoka Tano, The Mandalorian and More Incredible Black Series Figures 70 IMAGES</p>

<p>The new Rebels-themed wave comes as part of an ambitious overhaul of the Black Series line. Upcoming waves will feature redesigned packaging with color-coded box art that connects to form a larger collage image. Along with the new Rebels and Mandalorian waves, Hasbro is also teasing another Empire Strikes Back-themed wave as the company continues celebrating the 40th anniversary of that Star Wars sequel.From Ahsoka to Hera Syndulla to Darth Vader, check out the new Black Series figures revealed in the slideshow gallery below:While many of the Rebels characters featured here have already had Black Series figures in the past, Zeb Orrelios is a newcomer to the line. Even the returning characters are being upgraded with improved head sculpts using Hasbro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Photo Real&rdquo; digital scanning technology.As for Din Djarin, this new figure will be a welcome release for anyone still struggling to find Hasbro&rsquo;s previous Mandalorian figure in stores. This isn&rsquo;t a re-release of that figure, however, but instead a new version featuring the lone gunfighter wearing his upgraded Beskar armor. He&rsquo;ll be accompanied by a new Imperial Remnant Stormtrooper figure, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll continue to see more characters from Season 1 get Black Series figures.All of these figures are slated for release in Fall 2020 and will range in price from $19.99 to $29.99.Earlier this year at ToyFair, Hasbro unveiled its elaborate Baby Yoda animatronic action figure , and it&rsquo;s just as adorable as you&rsquo;d expect. See it in action in the video below:In other recent collectibles news, Knights of the Old Republic villains Darth Revan and Darth Malak are getting new Funko Pop! figurines, while Joaquin Phoenix&rsquo;s Joker is being immortalized in the form of an insanely expensive statue.</p>

<h3 id="an-ahsoka-tano-live-action-series-in-development-at-disney">&ldquo;An Ahsoka Tano Live-Action Series In Development At Disney+&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://comicyears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ahsoka-tano-live-action-series-featured.jpg" alt="img">
An Ahsoka Tano live-action series could be in the works, based on a report from FandomWire. Tano first appeared in the The Clone Wars series and continued her rise through the other Star Wars animated shows. The first-ever live-action Ahsoka Tano will already appear in season 2 of The Mandalorian. And after years of fan-casting, Rosario Dawson is set to play the live-action version of Tano in the Disney+ series. Now, a new report says that Ahsoka could get her own Disney+ series.</p>
<p>Who Is Ahsoka Tano?</p>
<p>The young Ahsoka | Images via Disney+</p>
<p>Ahsoka Tano was a character in the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and the series that it spawned afterward. The character was a prominent one in the first 5 seasons of The Clone Wars animated series, returning for its final season recently on Disney+. While initially the character didn’t receive too much praise from audiences and critics, that eventually changed. Tano became so popular that she appeared in a supporting role in another Star Wars animated series, Rebels.</p>
<p>Ahsoka’s creation was to provide better character development for Anakin Skywalker. The series took place between Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith. She existed to show how the main character, Anakin, evolved from an impulsive young Padawan into a reserved Jedi Knight. However, her development into her own person, and how her arc coincided with Anakin’s, gave us one of the best Star Wars characters ever.</p>
<p>How Ahsoka Became So Important Within The Star Wars Franchise</p>
<p>Ahsoka the wise | Images via Disney+</p>
<p>With the return and conclusion of The Clone Wars series on Disney+, Ahsoka Tano is very much in the limelight recently, and for good reason. The original Star Wars prequels enhanced the entire movie series by providing depth and insight into the Skywalker line. Seeing the progression of Anakin from a child, through his formative years and into his turn to the dark side resonated with audiences. Especially in a way that a simple 2-hour movie cannot replicate. While Luke Skywalker’s journey is similar, we saw him when he was almost an adult. And in comparison, Luke’s journey wasn’t as turbulent or tragic as Anakin’s.</p>
<p>Similarly, audiences experienced Ahsoka Tano’s journey from a young and impulsive teen, into a wise and weathered adult. This journey took place over years though the medium of a long running TV series. Through her journey, she goes from idealistic to disillusioned and can even hold her own with Darth Vader. It’s a progression that mirrors that of the main character of the entire franchise. But despite that, the character is not that well known to casual audiences, outside of Star Wars fans.</p>
<p>A Live Action Ahsoka Tano Series Serves To Increase Her Popularity</p>
<p>Images via Disney+</p>
<p>Ahsoka Tano is a character that has always been in the animated works of the Star Wars franchise. Obviously not counting the scene in Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker where she cameo’d as one of the voices heard by Rey in the climax. But for fans outside the animated shows, Tano is relatively unknown. This will all change in season 2 of The Mandalorian when Rosario Dawson appears as the first-ever live-action Ahsoka Tano. However, a new rumor suggests that that might only be the beginning, with an Ahsoka Tano live-action series in the works.</p>
<p>Ahsoka Tano Live-Action Series Could Be Happening At Disney+</p>
<p>Images via Disney+</p>
<p>FandomWire recently gave an exclusive report outlining how an Ahsoka Tano live-action series is in development over at Disney+. The report goes on to describe the type of series that will feature Tano. The new series will reportedly focus on Tano, along with another animated Star Wars fan-favourite Sabine Wren. The plot of the show could see the two searching for another character, as a continuation of a plot point from Star Wars Rebels.</p>
<p>The report has not been confirmed by any official sources such as Star Wars or Disney, or any of the makers of The Mandalorian or even Dawson herself. However, it could be a smart move by Disney+ given the popularity of the character. With a renewed interest in Star Wars post-The Mandalorian, any spin-offs are not outside the realm of possibility. There is already an Obi-Wan Kenobi live-action series in development at Disney+, along with a Rogue One prequel featuring Cassian Andor.</p>
<p>No official confirmation yet on if an Ahsoka Tano live-action series will actually premiere on Disney+.</p>
<p>What do you think about an Ahsoka Tano live-action series? Let us know in the comments below.

<h3 id="ahsoka-tanos-top-10-most-memorable-moments">&ldquo;Ahsoka Tano’s Top 10 Most Memorable Moments&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.amazonaws.com/phillyfrontoffice/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/29164728/ahsoka.jpg?fit=740%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Ahsoka Tano is my favorite Star Wars character of all time. She is everything Disney wanted Rey to be during the new trilogy. Regardess, we’ll be seeing a lot more of Ahsoka moving forward across mediums. She is due to make her live-action debut during season two of The Mandalorian. To celebrate Ahsoka’s greatness, here are my top 10 most memorable moments of Ahsoka Tano in Star Wars: Rebels and The Clone Wars. Enjoy!</p>
<p>#10</p>
<p>Ahsoka Tano Confronts Obi-Wan Kenobi</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 9</p>
<p>With General Grievous attacking Coruscant, Obi-Wan and Anakin are faced with the decision to help Ahsoka take down Maul or rescue Palpatine. Obi-Wan opts to rescue the Chancellor and Ahsoka finally confronts Obi-Wan while cementing herself as the leader she is destined to become. “This is why the people have lost faith in the Jedi,” says Ahsoka to Obi-Wan. Ahsoka has never been afraid to speak her mind and this was such an emotional moment for me. The old Jedi vs the new Jedi in one scene.</p>
<p>The focus of the Jedi and who they truly protect was a fascinating subplot of The Clone Wars since Trace and Rafa Martez were introduced during the second arc of season 7. Ahsoka becoming enraged that Obi-Wan would rather save Chancellor Palpatine than help Bo-Katan and the people of Mandalore was perfect. The Jedi Knights head to Coruscant but not before Anakin delivers one of the most emotional moments of season 7. He gives the dual-lightsabers to Ahsoka. I’m not crying, you are.</p>
<p>#9</p>
<p>Ahsoka’s Decision</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 11</p>
<p>A small but large mystery from the season 7 centered on what Ahsoka wanted to tell Anakin Skywalker. Why didn’t Ahsoka tell Yoda about the Chancellor’s plan for Anakin Skywalker after being told during a previous episode from Darth Maul? Ahsoka’s distrust of the Jedi Council continued to take center stage and the consequences were immense. Beyond Order 66, I have to think that this will have clear consequences on Ahsoka’s character moving forward.</p>
<p>If Ahsoka told Yoda what she knows, how much of what transpired actually takes place? How much guilt will ravage Ahsoka Tano over this decision to not tell Yoda what she had learned from Darth Maul? If Mace Windu wasn’t such a prick towards her, would Ahsoka have told Yoda? I have so many questions as we continue to learn about Ahsoka as a Jedi but I have no doubt that this moment will be integral to the continued development of her character</p>
<p>#8</p>
<p>Ahsoka Saves Captain Rex</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 11</p>
<p>Quick side: Darth Maul was ridiculous in this episode. Darth Maul taking heads and arms without a lightsaber was eerily similar to Darth Vader’s entrance in Rogue One. A pure adrenaline rush. In a season filled with memorable moments, Darth Maul (channeling his inner Magneto) using a piece of scrap metal to decapitate a pair of troopers only feeds his massive legend.</p>
<p>Back to this awesome Ahsoka Tano moment: The “I am one with the Force. The Force is with me” scene of Ahsoka and Captain Rex deserves a mention in my top 10 Ahsoka moments. First thoughts go straight to the blind warrior Chirrut from Rogue One which embodies heavy themes of hope. I found this scene extremely important. Not because of the dynamic between Rex and Ahsoka, but due to Ahsoka’s reluctance to call herself a Jedi through much of season 7. Her conflict with her own destiny is what makes her such an amazing character.</p>
<p>#7</p>
<p>Ahsoka Reunites with Anakin and Finally Gets Respect</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 9</p>
<p>In the beginning of episode 9, Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan tell Obi-Wan and Anakin that they have a plan to capture the Sith Lord Darth Maul. Watching how eager Anakin was to take down Maul and his affection towards Ahsoka Tano was a fantastic memory. Bo-Katan tells the Jedi Knights that Darth Maul is on Mandalore and his presence has led to the suffering of her people. Obi-Wan insists to consult with the Jedi council with Bo-Katan.</p>
<p>This was the moment we have been waiting for. I don’t know much, but I do know that Dave Filoni knows character development. Watching Anakin and Ahsoka reunite was pure bliss. But my favorite moment here came from Anakin and Captain Rex honoring Ahsoka as Commander as well as an entire legion of clones to command. It’s been a long road for Ahsoka in terms of earning respect from her peers. Seeing Captain Rex and the 501st wearing Ahsoka’s helmet was emotional and beautiful. It also showcased the friendship between Ahsoka and Rex. A friendship that we’re going to see a lot more of moving forward. Just beautiful.</p>
<p>#6</p>
<p>The Lightsaber Drop</p>
<p>The Clone Wars Finale</p>
<p>During The Clone Wars finale, Rex and Ahsoka say their final goodbyes to their fallen comrades. Helmets sit on a pikes alongside Kevin Kiner’s incredible score. It’s a moment that deeply tugs the heartstrings and full of heartbreak and respect. Death echoes through the air as thousands and thousands of Jedi and clone troopers have perished across the galaxy. Ahsoka drops her lightsaber, which ultimately has only led her closer to death than peace and justice across the galaxy.</p>
<p>The next few minutes were incredibly emotional for me. We fast forward in time and see Darth Vader return to the crash site. Vader is very clearly looking for Ahsoka and retrieves the lightsaber she had left behind. Two thoughts immediately come to mind from this scene. One, it’s important to remember that the Galactic Empire would not have been possible without the clones. Two, I’ve talked and talked in these reviews and our Suit Up! podcasts about the similarities between Anakin and Captain Rex. This scene very clearly shows that Anakin was just as much of a pawn as the clone troopers during Order 66.</p>
<p>#5</p>
<p>Ahsoka vs the Inquisitors</p>
<p>Season 2, Episode 9</p>
<p>Ahsoka’s entrance in this scene with the chorus score in the background is spine tingling. Ahsoka reveals herself as a Jedi to the Inquisitors and an unbelievable lightsaber battle ensues while younglings, Ezra and Kanan Jarrus rush to safety. We see Ahsoka Tano’s fighting has become significantly more polished this time around. She easily takes down the Inquisitors and the confidence she has of herself is wildly impressive. At one point during the fight, she is seen nearly trolling the Inquisitors. What a moment.</p>
<p>#4</p>
<p>“Race you to the surface”</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 9</p>
<p>Watching Ahsoka jump ship to ship with her white lightsabers with the beautiful John Williams score in the background was an unforgettable experience from The Clone Wars. It was a triumphant moment in animation. This was the moment I realized that we have fully moved on from Attack of the Clones. Everything about this scene just felt bigger and more significant than anything we’ve seen before it.</p>
<p>The John Williams score was a stark reminder that we’ve officially landed in Revenge of the Sith territory. The series has steadily moved forward. If you needed another reason why Ahsoka is the most badass character in the Star Wars-Verse, this moment delivered and then some. The moment Ahsoka lands on Mandalore with the ship exploding behind her was hands down one of the best moments of the season. It was as epic as it gets.</p>
<p>#3</p>
<p>Ahsoka Leaves the Jedi Order</p>
<p>Season 5, Episode 20</p>
<p>Ahsoka Tano exposing the Jedi Council for their failures is what makes her such a fascinating character. The moment Ahsoka walks away from Anakin and her life as a Jedi is so important to her as a character. Similar to Anakin while unfortunate for the Jedi Council, she refuses to follow blindly and is never afraid to speak her mind. What’s important about this scene is that Ahsoka is not only leaving the Jedi, she is walking away from the most important relationship she’s ever had: her master Anakin.</p>
<p>It’s wild to think about the implications of this very moment. Not just for Ahsoka moving forward, but also for what it meant for Anakin and his character arc and eventually evolving into Darth Vader. Would Anakin have become Vader if Ahsoka ever left the Jedi Council? Anakin losing his padawan was immense but it also represented so much for Ahsoka’s cementing her own personal independence and standing up for what she believes in. I’ll never forget this moment.</p>
<p>#2</p>
<p>The Master vs The Apprentice</p>
<p>Season 2, Episode 23</p>
<p>Similar to the relationship between Ahsoka and Anakin, this duel is both painful and beautiful as it gets. Not only is this scene the single greatest moment of the Star Wars: Rebels series, this was Dave Filoni putting the Star Wars-verse on a pedestal. I can’t possibly think of a better way to end an amazing season. The epic finale of Ahsoka vs Vader is my #2 best Ahsoka Tano moment.</p>
<p>Much like some of the best from The Clone Wars, the writing, the dialogue and the score all mesh so beautifully well. This was the moment when Ahsoka Tano learns that Anakin has turned into Darth Vader and it all hits us like an emotional upper cut to the face. The showdown in the temple on Malachor was very symbolic of who Ahsoka is. She is a protector to the truest sense. She is a Jedi of the people and the way she challenges Vader to protect Ezra is incredibly heroic.</p>
<p>Similar to our number one moment, the fight choreography is pitch perfect. Ahsoka Tano cements herself as worthy with her dual-white lightsabers and brimming of confidence. Despite Anakin being the chosen one, Ahsoka holds her own quite well in this scene. This moment is only strengthened by the fact that these two have learned so much from each other. Ahsoka’s realization that Vader is Anakin is absolutely gut wrenching and ranks in the same tier of “I am your father” from The Empire Strikes Back. It’s that good. If you haven’t seen it, then please do so now.</p>
<p>#1</p>
<p>The Duel</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 10</p>
<p>Ahsoka and Maul’s fight scene, with the beautiful camera shots and drum score in the background, flat out gave me chills. “We could have destroyed Sidious” says Maul while fighting Ahsoka during an incredible action set piece. This scene solidified that the 4-part finale of The Clone Wars was one giant film rather than a TV series on Disney Plus. Even Maul’s fight choreography felt like it was ripped straight out of Episode One. In fact, Ray Parker, who played Maul in The Phantom Menace, returned to motion capture the fight sequence.</p>
<p>The pacing and the script all shined during this moment. So much emotion built up to this duel and rarely do Star Wars fans receive such satisfying end results. Ahsoka and Maul’s acting was also top notch here. I was honestly a bit shocked that Ahsoka was able to go toe-to-toe with Maul during this scene. Did Maul give Ahsoka everything he had? Was he just toying with her? I assume that the trauma of everything that went down over the previous years have clearly taken a toll on Maul’s fighting ability.</p>
<p>The duel we’ve all been waiting for…</p>
<p>Ahsoka Tano’s capture of Darth Maul is one of my favorite moments of Star Wars. It was thrilling, entertaining and the anticipation was immense. The payoff quite simply delivered. This was Ahsoka’s arrival as Jedi Master. “You don’t know what you’re doing. We’re all going to die” screams Darth Maul as he’s being captured. Ahsoka shows clear concern as she stares at the stars and the credits hit. All the feels.</p>

<h3 id="ahsoka-tano-reported-to-get-own-series-on-disney">&ldquo;Ahsoka Tano Reported To Get Own Series on Disney+&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://insidethemagic-119e2.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/the-pic.png" alt="img">
As we’ve recently reported, Ahsoka Tano has already been confirmed to be appearing on the second season of The Mandalorian on Disney+. However, now there are reported rumors pointing to the character moving beyond this supporting role and into her very own Star Wars story in a series on Disney+.</p>
<p>As shared by Comicbook.com, the rumor comes from @DanielRPK who states the character, who will be played by Rosario Dawson, will get her own series on Disney+ after appearing in The Mandalorian — which is believed to fall in-line with older rumors stating Dawson’s contract with Lucasfilm was for more than just The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>As we’ve previously reported, following the news of Rosario Dawson being confirmed for the role, the idea of Ahsoka Tano receiving her own series isn’t crazy as Dawson is an established actor and The Mandalorian has only been focused on Mando and his relationship with “The Child” as of yet–a storyline which cannot continue forever.</p>
<p>However, one possible storyline that could occur and include Ahsoka Tano could see Mando handing over The Child to Tano, which could lead to her series picking up from there.</p>
<p>This isn’t confirmed, but Star Wars fans are already hyped for The Mandalorian and the idea of adding Ahsoka Tano to this show may be too much story for one series.</p>
<p>Again, it’s worth mentioning that the idea of Ahsoka Tano (played by Rosario Dawson) receiving her own series on Disney+ is only a rumor. However, how cool would it be if this character was able to get her very own series on Disney+?</p>
<p>Upon the premiere of Dawson’s debut as Ahsoka Tano in The Mandalorian, this will be the first time the Star Wars character will ever be portrayed in live-action form after being voiced by Ashley Eckstein in all seven seasons of Clone Wars, the final season of which is currently airing on Disney+</p>
<p>Season 2 of The Mandalorian is expected to drop this fall on Disney+. If you are not yet signed up to the streaming service, click here.</p>

Ahsoka Tano Might Also Be Involved In The Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus Series</p>
<p>It’s being rumoured that Ahsoka Tano might be involved in some capacity in the upcoming Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus series.</p>
<p>This rumour comes from The Illuminerdi’s sources, which means it might not be 100% accurate.</p>
<p>However, I’ve heard a few outlets report that Disney and Lucasfilm are thinking of bringing Rosario Dawson’s version of Ahsoka Tano into more properties.</p>
<p>It was revealed a few weeks ago that Dawson will be playing the iconic Star Wars character.</p>
<p>Tano’s appeared in the animated Star Wars TV shows such as Star Wars: Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.</p>
<p>Star Wars fans got so excited about Ahsoka coming over to The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>Will Ahsoka Tano be in Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus?</p>
<p>Read more:</p>
<p>According to The Illuminerdi’s sources, Tano will play a part in the Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus.</p>
<p>We know that before the whole Coronavirus pandemic, they were about to start filming on the Kenobi series.</p>
<p>Ewan McGregor will be returning as the legendary Jedi Master.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan has interacted with Tano in the animated series, and they know one another pretty well.</p>
<p>It would be so cool if Tano paid him a visit, maybe to tell him what’s been going on with Darth Vader.</p>
