<p>At a time when nonprofits are struggling economically, a Greenville group is even more grateful to be able to provide some aid.</p>
<p>Greenville Women Giving (GWG), an initiative of the Community Foundation of Greenville, awarded seven charities with a total of $541,844 in grants.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, GWG disperses grants to nonprofits chosen through an application process.</p>
<p>This year’s allotment comes at a time when the community is facing unprecedented challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, GWG Co-Chair Emelia Stephenson said.</p>
<p>“It has been a privilege for us to be able to continue with our grant making, as we see such a change due to the coronavirus,” Stephenson said.</p>
<p>William Brown, founder and executive director of Legacy Early College, is grateful that his schools are a recipient.</p>
<p>Greenville nonprofits: Here&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re being impacted by the coronavirus</p>
<p>Legacy is a Title 1 charter school with an ultimate goal of getting students into and through college. Its high school students are bused to Greenville Tech and North Greenville Tech where they take courses for college credit.</p>
<p>“That means we’ve got a cost for tuition, we’ve got a cost for some transportation to get them to the colleges, and then a huge cost is the costs of the college textbooks,” Brown said. “We can’t ask the families to pay that.</p>
<p>“So, we asked Greenville Women Giving to help us with that and they did so very graciously.”</p>
<p>What to know: Coronavirus in South Carolina</p>
<p>Nonprofits submitted applications for funding between Oct. 14 and Nov. 29, 2019. To qualify, the applications must meet a need that directly supports at least one of GWG’s five core areas: the arts, the environment, education, health, and human services.</p>
<p>The GWG remained unaffected by the coronavirus in that its funds were “in hand” before Greenville began recognizing its effects in March, Stephenson said.</p>
<p>Though all applications were in by late fall, Stephenson said she believes members of GWG voted on projects with the pandemic in mind. One example, she said, is the awarding of funds to the Julie Valentine Center.</p>
<p>“We all are hearing that because of the current situation, both with economic and people remaining in home more, that anticipation is there will be more sexual abuse and sexual assaults,” she said.</p>
<p>She believes members were also looking at long-term needs post Covid-19. An example, she said, is that they chose to fund the initiative to keep the leopard breeding program going in The Greenville Zoo.</p>
<p>“When we come out of this and turn our attention back to the needs of the world as a whole, we will see that there’s a huge place for conservation efforts,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Tourism: Coronavirus could cause the Greenville Zoo to lose its lions</p>
<p>Soteria Community Development Corporation, the Greenville Center for the Creative Arts, and the Greenville Zoo Foundation are first-time GWG grantees.</p>
<p>The 2020 grantees are:</p>
<p>Greenville Center for the Creative Arts: $84,183 to enhance visitor experience by installing signage, ADA compliant entrances, gallery lighting, and security lighting.</p>
<p>$84,183 to enhance visitor experience by installing signage, ADA compliant entrances, gallery lighting, and security lighting. Greenville Zoo Foundation: $75,000 to remodel and expand the leopard housing area, meeting requirements for continued participation in the international Amur leopard breeding program.</p>
<p>$75,000 to remodel and expand the leopard housing area, meeting requirements for continued participation in the international Amur leopard breeding program. Harvest Hope Food Bank: $55,485 to install a new, safe loading dock system which will increase the efficiency of food intake and delivery to 450,000 people per year.</p>
<p>$55,485 to install a new, safe loading dock system which will increase the efficiency of food intake and delivery to 450,000 people per year. Julie Valentine Center: $99,225 to upgrade the sexual assault forensic exam room and increase access to trauma-informed counseling services for sexual assault victims.</p>
<p>$99,225 to upgrade the sexual assault forensic exam room and increase access to trauma-informed counseling services for sexual assault victims.

<p><img src="http://www.ipesearch.com/orgfiles/ZORGF000011/FSM/Layout/fsm-facebook.jpg" alt="img">
31 May 2020</p>
<p>UK MANUFACTURER Evac+Chair International is investing to future-proof the business as it relocates to Blythe Valley Park in Solihull, Birmingham, near Junction 4 of the M42.</p>
<p>Evac+Chair International is now manufacturing and distributing its products worldwide from the new 38,223 sq ft site. The increased space will allow the manufacturer to continue to grow and develop its products.</p>
<p>Evac+Chair International is the parent company of both Evac+Chair – the manufacturer of emergency evacuation solutions – and Paraid, the manufacturer of medical patient transportation solutions.</p>
<p>Located alongside a number of established technology businesses, Blythe Valley Park is the perfect location for Evac+Chair International to streamline the efficiencies of its manufacturing operations and continue its focus on R&amp;D and product development. Ultimately, the new site will help to secure the future growth of the business and, as a result, the safety of building occupants and healthcare patients worldwide.</p>
<p>Speaking to Fire Safety Matters about the move, Gerard Wallace (managing director of Evac+Chair International) said: “We’ve been based at our old site for over 35 years, so we are all extremely excited to make the move to our new and much larger premises. The current situation is undoubtedly challenging for every business, but by working closely with the NHS we have been able to continually support the healthcare sector.”</p>
<p>Wallace added: “At Evac+Chair International, our core goal is to ensure safety, whether that be for building occupants in the event of an emergency or hospital patients during transportation. In moving to the new site, the safety of our team is our main priority. The increased space will enable us to ensure social distancing procedures are rigorously maintained at all times.”</p>
<p>Importantly, Wallace concluded: “The site will also realise a new and improved working environment for the whole team, including the ‘Evac+Café’, a new showroom for our product ranges, extensive meeting facilities and the potential to develop an on-site training academy in the future.”</p>

<h3 id="臺灣ai雲卓越之星六-愛瑪麗歐首創即時大數據分析">&ldquo;臺灣AI雲卓越之星(六)-愛瑪麗歐首創即時大數據分析&rdquo;</h3>

臺灣AI雲卓越之星(六)-愛瑪麗歐首創即時大數據分析</p>
<p>愛瑪麗歐楊朝棟董事長</p>
<p>隨著運算資源日趨豐富，智慧零售解決方案也愈能有效幫助零售業者解決各類問題。愛瑪麗歐業務經理邵可霓指出，愛瑪麗歐的「數得利企業版(Soteria Enterprise)」大數據分析解決方案，為世界首創的即時零售分析雲方案軟體。由先進的人工智慧驅動，加上愛瑪麗歐的專利自動追蹤攝影機器人，能管理無上限的數量，使用者不論有多少相機、店面，都可直接用手機、電腦或平板等各種裝置，即時觀看影像，並用大數據分析資訊。</p>
<p>Soteria除了以256位元軍規加密影像資訊，為店主提供嚴密的隱私保護外，更透過人工智慧服務，即時計算人數、性別、年齡、熱點區域、使用率、尖峰分析、人流移動路徑等；此外，還可提供消費者行為的截圖、即時錄影畫面等重要資訊，並透過手機推播通知與警告，主動通報管理者視訊監控範圍出現的異狀。如有不明人物或可疑車輛出現在門口，店家可點選系統上的數據，立即觀看相關截圖或錄影，以利店主於第一時間採取行動。</p>
<p>以人數即時計算為例，店家可取得各時段的人潮數據，同時搭配人口統計變數分析，掌握不同客層的熱門時段，推出適合的促銷服務，吸引人潮停留。或是透過臉部辨識，建立VIP客戶及黑名單，讓店家可以在收到通知後，適時提供對應行銷服務。除了智慧零售應用外，Soteria也可用於倉庫、工地管理等，可用來監看工人的施工程序是否正確，是否有不當聚集等異常行為，或入侵工地竊取原物料等。</p>
<p>從傳統的經驗來看，邵可霓認為店家過去要做前述的決策，只能靠第一線員工來判斷，現在不僅有影像及報表數據，兩者結合更可讓店家一目了然，包括動線調整、行銷包裝、庫存叫貨、人力配置排班、促銷方案、防盜保全等需求，都可讓店家隨時依數據做出最佳決策。</p>
<p>邵可霓指出，傳統閉路電視監視器(CCTV)只能被動、無差別式錄影，且受到角度限制，多半只能作為出事後申請理賠的舉證用途，且常需綁定笨重又昂貴的電腦、螢幕、監控軟體及資安軟體，儲存容量與服務內容也受限，如果需要備份，甚至可能需要另外一組硬體。反觀Soteria不但提供雲端視訊分析解決方案，雲端影片儲存空間更是無限量供應，店家無須自行購置電腦或伺服器，大幅降低中小企業主導入門檻。</p>
<p>值得一提的是，愛瑪麗歐目前全球擁有5,000個以上訂閱者，每月資料分析量高達20億筆，豐富的資料數據也成為AI應用的最佳訓練素材。愛瑪麗歐在2019年下半就運用國網中心「臺灣AI雲」高速運算平台開發出「火形偵測」功能，不僅提高準確率，還大幅降低導入成本。</p>
<p>邵可霓還提到，火形偵測難在火焰形狀多變、顏色多樣(紅黃褐白藍)，變因太多難以判斷，一般火形偵測產品因為需要搭配溫感裝置或煙霧偵測裝置，購入成本居高不下。愛瑪麗歐運用國網中心的「臺灣AI雲」平台，訓練雲端智慧進行火形辨識，讓所有Soteria的用戶，即使不用溫感裝置或是煙霧偵測器，也能享受到尖端智慧居家科技。(林佩瑩整理報導)

EV battery costs have declined significantly over the past ten years, from more than $1,000 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to less than $200/kWh. Increasing cell energy is one way to decrease cost even further, as a higher specific energy value will result in fewer materials needed for the same total battery energy. However, it is difficult to increase the energy density beyond that of today’s cells, which are approximately 220 Wh/kg using graphite anodes.</p>
<p>Li-metal anodes deliver almost 10 times the storage capacity of graphite anodes, thus enabling much higher cell energies. However, Li-metal anodes suffer from poor cycle life (typically 10 cycles or less, compared to the 1000 cycle EV battery requirement).</p>
<p>Announced in 2016, the Battery500 consortium, led by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is working to to develop next-generation Li-metal anode cells delivering up to 500 Wh/kg. (Earlier post.)</p>
<p>In the first two years of this program, the Consortium made significant progress developing novel cell materials and integrating these materials in industry relevant pouch cells. At the beginning of the program, a Li-metal pouch cell delivered 300 Wh/kg but only cycled approximately 10 times.</p>
<p>Currently, the team has increased that energy density to 350 Wh/kg and extended the cycle life to more than 350 cycles. Specifically, they developed new electrolytes with enhanced stability against Li-metal, optimized the use of thick cathodes against a thin lithium foil, and applied cell-stack pressure to extend cycling life.</p>

<p>Recent research on even thicker cathodes and more stable electrolytes shows a path to a 500 Wh/kg cell. Current focuses include increasing rate capability and extending cycle life.</p>
<p>The Battery500 team is composed of world-class scientists and engineers from four National Laboratories and five universities. Notably, two of the researchers on the team, Professor Stanley Whittingham of Binghamton University and Professor John Goodenough of the University of Texas at Austin, received the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in Li-ion batteries.

<p>Everywhere around the world…resistance to industrialism, whether the machine or the factory or the culture, is likely only at the start and only where traditional values are strong and communities intact. – Kirkpatrick Sale, Rebels Against the Future …commitment and solidarity are mostly products of face-to-face, day-to-day interactions, unities of purpose that come from unities of place.” – Ibid. In 1971, [Loren] Mosher launched an alternative approach for people diagnosed with schizophrenia…Soteria House was an egalitarian and non-coercive social milieu employing non-professional care-givers. The results showed that people do far better with this…approach than with standard psychiatric treatment , and that people can recover with little or no use of antipsychotic drugs….the National Institute of Mental Health choked off Soteria house funding, and Mosher was fired from his NIMH position in 1982 . – Bruce E. Levine, Resisting Illegitimate Authority</p>
<p>Jay</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, at my brother’s request, I wrote my nephew Jason, who had unsuccessfully tried to get himself checked into a hospital in their town in Vermont and was now back in his apartment isolating, which in Jay’s case, was not about compliance with the pandemic lockdown. He had taken himself off his meds, an action that always leads to trouble. Feeling unsatisfied with the note I’d written, I called him on the phone for the first time in his 34 years, almost half of which have been afflicted by psychosis.</p>
<p>Jay answered my questions mostly in monosyllables, as is his way, but not without friendliness. I considered this my renewed commitment to maintaining some kind of contact with this nephew who grew up only 3 ½ hours away, largely without my ever knowing him. My brother called again shortly after my call – Jay had been involved in an incident at a video game store, pounding and “spitting”on the door of the closed shop, the informant said, alarming people in the vicinity. My brother says its likely he’ll be remanded to a hospital now, for his safety and the safety of others.</p>
<p>My letter had attempted to explain (more for myself than him, for whom “explanations” are way too late!), our distance from each other as a family – a factor, I’m certain in Jason’s unraveling. Insomuch as chemical imbalance theories of mental illness provide a convenient excuse for not making the radical social changes – ones that put human lives over profits – needed to preserve the health of human beings and communities, I do not buy them. Had a neighbor or relative stepped in to fill the breach when his mother’s breakdown led to her abandoning her young family, it would have allowed both her having space and time in which to heal and the family fully to be cared for. Much trauma could have been avoided. Such a neighborly action would have been“no big deal” in a time and place when mutual aid and interdependence were taken for granted. And had Jay, even if the family were intact, begun to experience a psychotic break, what a difference it could have made had there been family members to provide “egalitarian and non-coercive care” for him, rather than his beleaguered father having no choice but to hand him over to the psychiatric professionals and their regime of drugs?</p>
<p>Such family tragedies cannot be treated as matters for individual guilt or personal responsibility in a materialist society that disregards the realities of interdependence and interrelatedness, and a capitalist economy that benefits from weakened communities and relationships. My brothers and I could not, any more than anyone else in twentieth-century mainstream liberal society, have held a perspective that put family and community first. However, even in this time of moral anomie, such meaningless sacrifice of our children to the Moloch of “get ahead” and greed cannot be right. If such sacrifices may be preventable through proximity and conscious commitment, if all biological life is essentially interdependent, even if such a truth is intolerable to the entire thrust of western progress, is it not important that we move ourselves back inside that web of interdependence? Must we not, now, be disobedient, “rebels against the future?”</p>
<p>Healthy Society and Non-patriarchal Masculinity</p>
<p>There’s another point I must make, and do so advisedly: In Jay we have not only human wreckage, but male human wreckage. In neoliberal society’s preference for docile, passive citizens that make compliant employees and consumers, behaviors of the active, impulsive, non-compliant, bull-in-the-china-shop variety, often associated with men (but not exclusive to them), tend to be disapproved of in schools, diagnosed (ADHD, ODD), and medicated. Our society fails to distinguish between “toxic masculinity” and (non-patriarchal) masculinity. On the other hand, a healthy society – as modeled in traditional indigenous cultures – must have the protective function that masculine defiance, assertiveness, boldness, and disobedience provide – in balance with the deep embodied spirituality of the feminine – in order to sustain itself against forces of conquest and disintegration. It is tragic no matter who – of either gender – is lost to mental illness. But without too much of a stretch, one could almost see the entire psychiatric profession as enlisted in the cause of destroying masculine boisterousness, producing a general type of the passive, compliant consumer (of mental health services, anti-psychotic drugs and institutionalization) that we now have.</p>
<p>Has it come to pass that we are simply “too late” to question as inevitable this slip into the oblivion of passivity, allowing neoliberal authority a free pass to divide and conquer as they wish? Are we too late to resist being enlisted in the genocide against the natural energies of “manliness” – i.e., the protective function needed to resist complete neoliberal domination – an enlistment not unlike Herod’s order to destroy all the male infants? Are we to allow masculinity to be reduced to its pretense only, in those whose manliness has been displaced to their guns, in those with a rage against the vulnerable, the different and the immigrant? Are we too late to take back all we’ve sacrificed to have stream-lined, suburbanized lives, complicated by debt perhaps, but not by having to be burdened by interdependence, i.e., by sacrifice, caring for the weak, the mentally ill, the aged, or educating our children?</p>
<p>Is it too late for us to wake up, to recognize that men and women cannot have our true strength when we are at war with biological fact that gives us two kinds of human beings, each an archetypal mingling of the masculine with the feminine? Too late to realize that whatever we can yet do to preserve – or rather, by now, to recover – human lives worth living society must have both “othernesses,” each having its wholeness, so that disobedience to illegitimate neoliberal authority can be general, rather than the defiance of a radicalized, easily marginalized, few?</p>
<p>More even than capitalism, I hold bourgeois liberal reality that loyally upholds Wall Street legitimacy, to be accountable for the destruction of Jay. For that – for the contempt with which the souls of men and women are regarded by its fundamentalist rationalism and blind faith in science – this social order deserves our disobedience. If I go on to accuse the liberals such as Obama, or Hillary, or Biden, who talk about the environment, or apply a touch of socialism here and there while their walk serves Wall Street masters, who have no trouble being killers, it is as their being merely expressions of a more general phenomena for which I hold every liberal, educated, middle class white man and woman, myself included, responsible. Even if “we knew no better,” even if we have struggled with insanity ourselves – the truth is, in loyalty to bourgeois reality, we’ve abandoned what we were supposed to tend carefully with our whole hearts and minds.</p>
<p>Like Jay, I was the middle child, I too the identified “troubled” one in the family “system.” I too know what it is like – though not to the point of hearing voices – to “go mad.” Saying this, am I over-identifying with my nephew? Hey, it’s sad, but shit happens. But, really, I am his aunt, – how is it possible to “over-identify?” Echoing Ebenezer Scrooge: Was not humankind – my brother’s child – my business? No, I prefer to think that I’m not wrong for feeling meaningless human sacrifices cannot be made without wounding humanity. And that, now or never, in order to heal ourselves and the world, our way of life must go defiantly backward as our backward friends the Luddites (and many others) tried to warn us would be necessary, toward the indigenous and “local,’ where there can once again be “unities of purpose that come from unities of place.”</p>
<p>Bunkered in this strange, de-peopled pandemic environment, we’re offered a rare chance to value that which we cannot now have – people! Somehow, even though we maintain a powerful nostalgia for the peopled world of family, local shops, neighborhoods, etc., and can be manipulated around and sold things based on this sentimental attachment, we sell out our interdependence every day. Every day, we do the easier thing: we accept the polarized, divisive and reductive social arrangements we were given in industrial capitalist society, and substitute for what we have lost (and need) the suburban lifestyle we can buy. In addition, we substitute for the real belonging of community in place over time, the pseudo-communities of celebrity-worship, MSNBC/Fox partisan devotions, spectator sports, patriotism, virtual community, etc.</p>
<p>With Earth Day just having passed, its ludicrous to hope, as so many of us in the liberal world do, to save the earth’s interrelated systems at the same time despising our human interdependence. Though undeserving, we don’t lack for genuine leadership in the art of preserving humanity in balance with the natural world. As many today see it, the indigenous perspective is, simply, right. But we are not indigenous! We do not know how to get our mentality, our inner selves, our thoughtworld back in line with that balance. To this dilemma, the answer is not imitation, or even alliance with Native people as they fight for sacred lands and water, but to ourselves defy the neoliberal order we serve that treats relationships as unreal and forfeitable, to make “the social” real once more. To, when pandemic sequestration ends, disobediently take up our roles in our immediate social worlds such that we re-cultivate our “acre” of social-scape. Though it be “scorched beyond recognition,” here we’re grounded in the real interconnections that exist, that, in obedience to bourgeois reality, we have dishonored.</p>
<p>Poetic Disobedience</p>
<p>The power to rebuild the social world in its natural interdependence, in balance with nature, resides in our humanity – the same humanity that appears admirable in its traditionalist Native iteration. Like theirs, our souls, too, have an indigenous “layer” that apprehends the interrelationships – within self, between men and women, with the natural world. This faculty of apprehension in the white non-indigenous world is called poetic. By poetic art, I mean language art that puts unitive, connective metaphoric understanding into words, such that the subjective imagination’s way of seeing connectively, dominates over so-called objectivity. Not coincidentally, poetic truth is marginalized in industrial society, for what other perspective could be more essentially anathema to capitalism’s egoist divisiveness and blind faith in objectivity than the poetic?</p>
<p>To the disobedience of poetry we now must turn, no stranger an idea than that we should imitate indigenousness, and in contrast, practicable for white middle class liberals! It’s no coincidence that admired Native Americans like Seattle or Sitting Bull, spoke in poetry! While white people cannot force our mentalities back into “paleolithicity,” we can access the unitive, “primitive” layer of our being that expresses itself poetically. In obedience to industrial society, we have suppressed this part of our nature, that belongs, not exclusively to Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, etc., but inclusively to everyone.</p>
<p>Our imagination-fed creative function, that sees the world connected, sacralized, must be the source of our entrancement, rather than the artificially propped up world that would collapse in a minute once we realized we do not need it – not the cars, the TV’s, the MSNBC and NPR news spectacle, nor the gadgets and frequent-flier miles. To free the poetic self is no egotistical act: it is to serve and protect the integrated, “holistic,” poetic (feminine) vision, in disobedience to unimaginative, bottom-line, numbers-crunching, dehumanizing neoliberal reality.</p>
<p>Poetic anti-authoritarianism has the necessary imaginative scope to retrieve the endangered masculinity I see in the tragically shattered person of my nephew, in other young men I have known, in my brothers and in my husband. But a woman engaging in poetic disobedience does so equally for her womanself. Liberals have confidently imagined that by purging ourselves of pathological masculinity, we then could be truly free. I find, rather, that the work of our interdependence is to engage in a very different kind of loving committed to restoring men and women in the fullness of their integrated beings, a unity of strengths can defend our “unities of purpose.”</p>
<p>My sole “credential” in speaking for a “poetic disobedience” is that I have been stumbling along this path – more often blind than sighted – for many years. My authority is my subjective experience of the connectedness revealed through the act of creative expression. It tells me “humankind is my purpose.” Subjective authority alone ratifies Orin and my Luddite-like choices that are a life-way of disobedience to the illegitimate authority of liberal reality. Unintentionally, over the last decade or more, we found we’d replaced the central task of disobedience – i.e, the time-consuming practice of honest inward focus – with worthy community and family demands. In the liminal space provided by the pandemic pause, we find an opportunity to re-orient. Gifted with time, we’re back in the moil and toil of the soul’s process, our quixotic aim unchanged – to rebuild intact local community where it’s “too late.”

<p><img src="https://cdn.pharmiweb.com/media/1024/1200x448-pwjobs.png" alt="img">
Intract Pharma Limited London, UK (“Intract”), and Elasmogen Limited, Aberdeen, Scotland (“Elasmogen”) have announced an agreement to collaborate and develop novel orally-delivered protein therapeutics (biologics), incorporating proprietary technologies developed by each of the partners.</p>
<p>The collaboration combines Elasmogen’s soloMER™ technology, small (11 kDa) single-chain binding domains that can be rapidly re-formatted to generate super-neutralizers (bivalent, biparatropic) with Intract’s Soteria® and Phloral® technologies, a unique platform for oral delivery of biologics targeted to the lower GI tract. Combining the advantages of these platforms will allow the oral delivery of therapeutically active, highly potent and gut targeted proteins, initially focused on local GI indications such as inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
<p>Bill Lindsay, CEO of Intract, said “Collaboration with Elasmogen represents an exciting synergy of Intract’s expertise in the formulation of biologic drugs with Elasmogen’s unique multi-valent formats to allow the development of novel and potent oral therapeutics”.</p>
<p>Caroline Barelle, CEO of Elasmogen said “Achieving oral delivery of our soloMER products is a key differentiator for our technology and I am delighted that following very encouraging proof of concept studies with Intract’s Soteria technology we can now announce this extended and accelerating collaboration.”</p>
<p>The collaboration will focus initially on a preclinically validated Elasmogen compound as treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, with the expectation that full clinical assessment of the oral formulation will begin in Q2 2021.</p>
<p>About Elasmogen Limited</p>
<p>Company Contact: Caroline Barelle, CEO, Elasmogen. <a href="mailto:caroline.barelle@elasmogen.com">caroline.barelle@elasmogen.com</a></p>
<p>Spun-out from the University of Aberdeen in 2016, Elasmogen is developing soloMERs™; fully humanized, next generation, single chain therapeutics for auto-inflammatory diseases and cancer. soloMERs™ are proprietary humanized clinical candidates derived from VNARS (variable new-antigen receptors) which exist naturally in sharks as high affinity binding domains. With a different ancestral origin from antibodies this example of 400 million year old convergent evolution places VNARs outside of the complex patent landscape that describes and protects antibody drug discovery and has produced the smallest (9% of the size of an antibody) and most robust naturally occurring binding domain. Elasmogen is unique in its capacity to isolate and develop soloMERs™, with a multi-layered IP position covering the platform, formats, products and process including an exclusive license to over 25 patents granted in the US, Europe and other territories.</p>
<p>About Intract Pharma Limited</p>
<p>Intract Pharma is an oral drug delivery specialist, developing state-of-the-art formulation technologies and unique gastrointestinal models to develop advanced new therapeutics. Since its inception, Intract has pursued innovation in oral drug delivery as a means to improve on current therapies, making them safer and more effective for patients.
