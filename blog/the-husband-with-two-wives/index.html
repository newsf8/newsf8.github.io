<p><img src="https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/1200x366?source=https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/image/103732361.JPG&amp;operation=CROP&amp;offset=0x86&amp;resize=1196x673" alt="img">
Failure to dissolve customary marriage leads to two wives fighting for dead husband&rsquo;s R3m estate</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share</p>
<p>A deceased businessman’s failure to dissolve his first customary marriage by a divorce decree has left his family in a legal battle with the estranged first wife over a R3m estate. Tieu Coliphter Phage’s estranged customary wife, Mokgaetji Ledwaba, who he left in 2008 after a year of marriage, staked her claim to his estate after his death in 2012. The Polokwane Master of the High Court appointed Ledwaba as co-executrix of Phage’s estate along with Matsatsi Monyepao, whom he married in 2010, also under customary law, and lived with her until his death. Legal battles between Monyepao and Ledwaba, each of whom have a child with Phage, have been raging since the decision of the Master of the High Court to appoint both women as co-executrix. Ledwaba argued in court that Monyepao only pushed to remove her as co-executrix after an amount of R3.8 million was paid into Phage’s business accounts.</p>
<p>After two hearings at the Polokwane High Court, the first won by Monyepao and the last by Ledwaba on appeal, the matter is headed to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA).</p>
<p>In her short-lived victory, Monyepao had convinced Deputy Judge President Fikile Mokgohloa that Ledwaba must forfeit her stake in the estate on grounds that her marriage to Phage was dissolved in February 2008 because of her misconduct.</p>
<p>Judge Mokgohloa found that what effectively dissolved Ledwaba’s union with Phage was her civil marriage to a man named Mr K in court papers.</p>
<p>Ledwaba married Mr K in 2009.</p>
<p>“Ledwaba’s version is that she still regarded herself as married to the deceased irrespective of her marriage to Mr K,” said Judge Mokgohloa. “If that is true, then, (she) practised polyandry, which is illegal in our law. In my view the conduct gave rise to the breakdown of her marriage to the deceased.”</p>
<p>Ledwaba managed to set aside Judge Mokgohloa’s ruling on appeal at the Polokwane High Court.</p>
<p>A full Bench ruled that her marriage to Mr K was null in the first place, meaning it did not dissolve her customary marriage with Phage. It was Ledwaba’s argument that her marriage to Mr K was null.</p>
<p>To rule in Ledwaba’s favour on Mr K’s marriage nullity, the Bench relied on precedent-setting judgments which found that civil marriages entered into with another partner in an existing customary union were null.</p>
<p>The Bench said it was incorrect of Judge Mokgohloa to rule that Ledwaba’s patrimonial benefits in the estate could be forfeited by anything other than divorce.</p>
<p>“This approach is flawed because a forfeiture of benefits must follow an enquiry into misconduct on the part of one of the parties to the marriage,” said the Bench.</p>
<p>“This did not occur in this matter. There were no divorce proceedings at all.”</p>
<p>The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act stipulates that customary marriages may only be dissolved by a court.</p>
<p>Monyepao now looks to the SCA to settle the matter in her favour.</p>
<p>A notice of the Bloemfontein-based court cited her as plaintiff and Ledwaba as defendant in the appeal hearing set down for May 20.</p>
<p>According to the notice, the court will hear arguments on whether Ledwaba should forfeit her patrimonial benefits due to the misconduct during her marriage with Phage.</p>
<p>The court’s Bench will also be called to rule on whether Ledwaba’s marriage to Mr K was null, thus failing to dissolve her union with Phage.</p>
<p>The Star reported previously that law experts urged the country to develop a culture of dissolving customary marriages in court by divorce.</p>
<p>Melusi Xulu, managing director of Donda Attorneys, at the time said that there were strong indications that many in the country were still married to ex-partners.</p>
<p>“The safest thing is to go to court and file for divorce once you know that you have separated,” he said.</p>
<p>“Many people are asking, even on Twitter, ‘What if the woman leaves?’ It means you’ve only separated not divorced.”

<h3 id="are-you-married-but-lonely">&ldquo;Are You Married But Lonely?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2020-05/walk-932965_1920.jpg?itok=0qvwLZ-n" alt="img">
We humans are a highly social species, and we need deep emotional relationships with others to flourish in life. In adulthood, most of us turn to our spouses to meet the bulk of our companionship and needs. While we hope that our spouse will be our best friend—even our soulmate—all too often husbands and wives drift apart and experience high levels of loneliness in their . In fact, previous research shows that about a third of all older married persons report feeling lonely often.</p>
<p>Until now, psychologists have mainly focused on the dynamics within the marriage to explain loneliness among older married couples. From this perspective, two possible explanations have been proposed. First, it could be that the shared circumstances of the marriage lead to loneliness. For instance, friends and family members may move away or die, depriving the elderly couple of the social contacts they once had.</p>
<p>Second, it could be that lonely people tend to marry other lonely people, leading to a lifelong pattern of for the couple. While the experience of loneliness comes from a lack of meaningful social interaction, it’s also the case that lonely people tend to sabotage whatever social encounters they find themselves in.</p>
<p>In a recent article, however, Montclair State University psychologist Ashley Ermer and colleagues look beyond the spousal relationship to the larger of family and friends to see how these affect the perception of loneliness in marriage. They also explored how reported loneliness in married couples changes over time.</p>
<p>For this study, the researchers sampled nearly 1,400 heterosexual married couples in their fifties through seventies who remained married for the entire eight-year span of the study. The sample was representative of the national population in terms of . Both partners responded to an extensive survey on three occasions, once in 2006, again in 2010, and a final time in 2014.</p>
<p>The survey posed questions intended to measure a number of variables of interest to the researchers. The first set of questions gathered basic demographic information, such as age, race, ethnicity, and income. They also reported how lonely they felt.</p>
<p>The second set of questions assessed the quality of their social relationships, in particular looking at support and strain in friendships, family, and the marriage itself. Questions such as “How much can you rely on them if you have a serious problem?” measured support, while questions like “How often do they make too many demands on you?” assessed strain. Respondents were also asked how close they felt to their spouse.</p>
<p>The third set of questions measured the quantity of social relationships. For example, respondents were asked to estimate the number of people in their close social network. They also indicated how frequently they met with family members and friends.</p>
<p>The analysis of this large data set was complex, but a few interesting trends emerged. First, the data show that quality is far more important than quantity when it comes to abating loneliness. This finding is consistent with the general findings in the field that you only need a few meaningful relationships in life to be happy.</p>
<p>A second trend in these data, however, contradicted the general belief that older couples grow lonely or happy together. In fact, Ermer and colleagues found that husbands’ and wives’ levels of loneliness were not strongly correlated. That is, they found little evidence that lonely people other marry lonely people. Nor did they found strong evidence that couples’ feelings of loneliness grew more similar over time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they found that friendships were more important than family relationships in reducing loneliness. After all, family relationships are obligatory, so we have to put up with them even when there’s a lot of negativity. Friendships, in contrast, can be severed if they prove to be more of a burden than a benefit.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that levels of loneliness did change over time for many of the respondents. However, the reasons for these changes were different for husbands and wives. In this respect, three findings were particularly interesting.</p>
<p>First, the wife’s level of loneliness at the first measurement predicted loneliness for both herself and her husband at the second two measurements. However, the husband’s initial level of loneliness was no indicator of how either of them would feel later on. This finding is consistent with the general observation that it is the wife who sets the emotional tone of the marriage.</p>
<p>In other words, the husband depends on the wife to create and maintain the external social relationships of the marriage. If she has many friends, he’ll likely be friends with their husbands. But if she’s socially isolated, he will be too.</p>
<p>Second, the husband’s loneliness in later marriage was predicted by his perceived level of marital strain. While he felt more positive than negative interactions with his wife, he also felt less loneliness, likely because he could depend on her to maintain their social network. But when marital strain was high, this was no longer the case, and so his loneliness increased.</p>
<p>Third, the wife’s loneliness in later marriage was predicted by the number of friends she had, not by the quality of her marriage. This suggests that women in high-strain marriages can still find overall in life if they have a strong network of caring friends. However, this doesn’t seem to be the case for men, who tend to be much more dependent on their wives for meeting their companionship and intimacy needs than their spouses are.</p>
<p>These findings provide suggestions for how marriages counselors should work with couples reporting high levels of loneliness. But they also suggests things that husbands and wives can work on to reduce loneliness and improve marital quality in general.</p>
<p>For instance, wives should keep in mind that their husbands rely heavily on them for building and maintaining the social network that they both share. And for their part, husbands can reduce marital strain by yielding more often to their wives’ requests, with the understanding that they benefit from keeping their wives happy. In sum, focusing on the positive aspects of the relationship is the best way to avoid growing lonely together in old age.

<p>Gwendlyn, 18, shared a video from the exciting moment.</p>
<p>She caption the video from her graduation: &ldquo;Video Footage of me graduating in the coolest way possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m so grateful to the staff and faculty at my school for putting all that work into giving us a good graduation and even in parade form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was super skeptical about this and just struggling to enjoy myself bc I had expected a very boring attempt at a graduation, but they showed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;School faculty is underrated and I’d 100% be down if this was how people decided to have graduations from now on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Sister Wives fans know, Kody “rotates” homes during the week, though it has been long-rumored that his home base is with fourth and “favorite” wife Robyn, 41.</p>

<p>Kody and Meri’s marriage has been on the rocks for years.</p>
<p>On the most recent Sister Wives season, Meri admitted their marriage has been “pretty rocky for a while,” while Kody “regretted” their relationship.</p>
<p>He explained on an episode: “I feel like I was deceived into a relationship that was very different than what I expected. Meri and I had a fast courtship with a lot of expectations and a lot of not communicating.”</p>
<p>Meri added: “The relationship he and I had, it’s dead, it’s gone, it’s over.”</p>
<p>7 She has also posted cryptic quotes Credit: TLC</p>
<p>Meri has hinted at a split when she posted cryptic quotes and a photo without her wedding ring.</p>
<p>One quote last week read: “Belonging so fully to yourself that you’re willing to stand alone is a wilderness - an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. The wilderness can often feel unholy because we can’t control it, or what people think about our choice of whether to venture into that vastness or not.”</p>

Johannesburg – North West police are investigating two cases where husbands allegedly shot and killed their wives then turned the guns on themselves.</p>
<p>In the first incident, police were called to a house in Lerome village near Mogwase on Monday where a couple was found dead in bed, according to North West Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone.</p>
<p>Police believe that the man may have killed his wife then stayed with the body for some time before killing himself as the woman&rsquo;s body was on the point of decomposing while his was still fresh.</p>
<p>The next day, a 29-year-old man from Punodung Section in Phokeng allegedly shot and killed his 24-year-old wife then turned the gun on himself. The couple were married in February.</p>
<p>It is alleged that the woman had complained to her mother-in-law about her husband&rsquo;s behaviour. The mother-in-law tried to intervene which angared her son and led to an argument with his wife.

SISTER Wives star Meri Brown &ldquo;spent the night&rdquo; with her husband Kody despite their suspected split.</p>
<p>Kody and third wife Christine’s daughter Ysabel, 17, said on Facebook Live that her father had spent the night at Meri’s home the day before, according to All About the Tea.</p>

<p>She continued that Kody, 51, would likely spend that night with second wife Janelle, 50.</p>
<p>As Sister Wives fans know, Kody “rotates” homes during the week, though it has been long-rumored that his home base is with fourth and “favorite” wife Robyn, 41.</p>
<p>Meri, 49, hasn’t posted him on social media since January 2019.</p>
<p>He was spotted in one of her Facebook Live videos earlier this month when he stopped by to have her sign legal papers.</p>

<p>Kody and Meri’s marriage has been on the rocks for years.</p>
<p>On Sister Wives, Meri has contemplated leaving the family.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kody divorced her to marry fourth and &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; wife Robyn, 41, which Meri cried over on the most recent season.</p>
<p>She was involved in a catfish scandal and fell in love with another man, who ended up being a woman.</p>
<p>6 Meri admitted their marriage has been &lsquo;pretty rocky for a while&rsquo; Credit: Instagram</p>
<p>On the most recent Sister Wives season, Meri admitted their marriage has been “pretty rocky for a while,” while Kody “regretted” their relationship.</p>
<p>He explained on an episode: “I feel like I was deceived into a relationship that was very different than what I expected. Meri and I had a fast courtship with a lot of expectations and a lot of not communicating.”</p>
<p>Meri added: “The relationship he and I had, it’s dead, it’s gone, it’s over.”</p>
<p>6 Meri has posted without her wedding ring Credit: Refer to Caption</p>
<p>Meri has hinted at a split when she posted cryptic quotes and a photo without her wedding ring.</p>
<p>One quote last week read: “Belonging so fully to yourself that you’re willing to stand alone is a wilderness - an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. The wilderness can often feel unholy because we can’t control it, or what people think about our choice of whether to venture into that vastness or not.”</p>
<p>The quote ended with: &ldquo;But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it’s the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.”</p>

<h3 id="the-book-of-ruth-and-coronavirus">&ldquo;The book of Ruth and coronavirus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/blogs/uploads/users/yehuda-lave1580690796-400x400.jpg" alt="img">
The Book of Ruth is an Old Testament book belonging to the third section of the biblical canon the Tanach, known as the Ketuvim, or Writings. … The book is named for its central character, a Moabite woman who married the son of a Judaean couple living in Moab.</p>
<p>The Book of Ruth is one of only two books of the bible to be named after women (the other is Esther). Even though it’s small, this remarkable book contains many principles with a profound impact on our lives today.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) Ruth stands with the Song of Solomon, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther; together they make up the Megillot, five scrolls that are read at prescribed times on Jewish religious festivals. Ruth was the festival scroll that we had for Shavout, the Feast of Weeks, 50 days after Passover.</p>
<p>One of the most inspiring messages of the book of Ruth is that a person who displays selfless compassion will be rewarded in the end. At the beginning of the book, readers are introduced to Naomi and her two daughters-in-law, Ruth and Orpah.</p>
<p>Ruth, a woman who after being widowed remains with her husband’s mother. … Where you die, I will die—there will I be buried.” Ruth accompanies Naomi to Bethlehem and later marries Boaz, a distant relative of her late father-in-law. She is a symbol of abiding loyalty and devotion</p>
<p>Here is a quick synopsis of the Book of Ruth. To start out, a woman by the name of Naomi packed up and moved from Judah to Moab due to a terrible famine that was affecting her family. She and her husband moved there with their two sons, who eventually took wives (Ruth and Opah) while living in Moab.</p>
<p>Tragically, Naomi lost her husband and two sons. Broken and empty, Naomi decided to move back to Bethlehem in Judah. Her daughter-in-law Ruth came with her since she had also lost her husband. Keep in mind that Ruth was a Moabite woman, and she was now moving to Judah as a foreigner. This was a big deal in their culture, but she was committed to Naomi as her daughter-in-law, and she wanted to follow after the G-d of Israel. Ruth steadfastly stayed with her Mother-in-law and uttered her famous words that she would stick with Naomi through thick and thin. Her sister-in-law left and according to tradition became the Great grandmother of Goliath who King David later kills.</p>
<p>While in Judah, G-d worked out an amazing plan for a man named Boaz to take Ruth as his wife, give her a child, and provide for her and Naomi. What’s remarkable about this plan was that Boaz was qualified as a “kinsman-redeemer” to take her as his wife.</p>
<p>What in the world is a “kinsman-redeemer” you may ask? Well, they had a custom in those days, based upon Deuteronomy 25-6 that directed that a relative of a man who dies should marry that man’s widow in order to perpetuate his lineage through this woman.</p>
<p>According to G-d’s remarkable sovereignty, it turned out that Boaz was a relative to Ruth’s husband who had passed away; so, he was qualified to marry her and perpetuate his lineage. So, even in the midst of Ruth and Naomi’s awful affliction, God still had a plan to take care of them. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>There are important applications that jump out:</p>
<ol>
<li>God is concerned about all people regardless of race, nationality, or status.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ruth was not a Jew. She was a Moabite. Even though many discriminated against her, G-d loved her just the same. G-d does not discriminate, and He/She loves all people just the same.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Men and women are both equally important to G-d.</li>
</ol>
<p>G-d cares about men and women all the same. We are all one in His eyes. While most false religions that have been constructed over the centuries often elevate men and dishonor women, Judaism is the one religion that consistently honors men and women at the same level. There is no difference in His eyes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>There is no such thing as an unimportant person in G-d’s eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p>At a surface level, few saw Ruth as an important person. She was from Moab, which was a nation that originated from an incestuous encounter between Lot and one of his daughters (see Genesis 19:30-36). She was a poor widow. She was living in a foreign land away from her birth family.</p>
<p>But G-d saw her as important and His plan for her life culminated in her becoming a part of the lineage of King David (as the great-great-grandmother to King David). G-d’s plan typically involves using people who are considered to be underdogs or unimportant or unimpressive from man’s perspective. His strength is made perfect in our weakness</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>G-d uses “little” things to accomplish great plans.</li>
</ol>
<p>What an amazing plan G-d had for a series of “little” things that all added up to important pieces in G-d’s big plan. God intended for Ruth to be a part of the story of the lineage of King David. So, He pulled together events such as the famine, Naomi’s relocation to Moab, their return to Bethlehem, Boaz’s bloodline, and many other events just to ensure that Ruth could be a part of His plan. The other book named after a woman, Esther, has many similar little things that add up to big things. And G-d does that same thing in our lives today! All the events of the CoronaVirus are part of his/her plan</p>
<p>A Mother’s Love</p>
<p>Miriam begins to notice that whenever her 5 year old daughter Sarah is asked her name, she answers, “I’m Mrs. Freedman’s daughter.”</p>
<p>So one day, just before bedtime, Miriam says to Sarah, “Bubbeleh, whenever anyone asks you what your name is, you shouldn’t say, ‘I’m Mrs. Freedman’s daughter.’ You should proudly say, ‘My name is Sarah.’ Sarah is such a beautiful name – the Torah even tells us that another lovely Sarah was the wife of Abraham and the mother of Isaac.”</p>
<p>“OK, mommy,” says Sarah.</p>
<p>Later that week, a rabbi is visiting Sarah’s class at school and as soon as he sees Sarah, he goes over to her and says, “Hello, aren’t you Mrs. Freedman’s daughter?”</p>
<p>“I thought I was,” replies Sarah, “but my mommy says I’m not.”
