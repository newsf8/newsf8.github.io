<p>These are times when people are digging up the old pictures from their archives and sharing on their social handle. And it’s no different in the case of celebrities. A lot of them have been sharing a lot of throwback pictures, either because they recently cleaned their wardrobe or just came across an album or picture on social media. And that’s what we are here to talk about. A throwback picture of Shah Rukh Khan and his daughter Suhana is going viral as you read this. Also Read – Monday Memes: This amalgamation of Bollywood and coronavirus lockdown jokes will make you ROFL</p>
<p>Filmfare had tweeted out the picture on their social handle which a fan or Shah Rukh Khan reposted. Told you, the father-daughter duo’s throwback picture is going viral. Talking about the picture, in it, we can see Shah Rukh sitting on a chair on the sets of his film. Suhana could be seen standing by his side and adjusting his hair. Filmfare had captioned the image saying, “A #throwback picture of #SuhanaKhan making sure her father #ShahRukhKhan’s hair looks on point before going on camera.” The picture looks decade old as now Suhana has turned into a gorgeous belle but is still completing her education. Have a look at the throwback picture here: Also Read – Shah Rukh Khan confesses to having cheated on Gauri Khan on their honeymoon; says, ‘It was all a lie, but somehow I convinced her’</p>

<p>How cute is this? I sure do it with my father still. What about you?</p>
<p>On the work front, Shah Rukh Khan was last seen in Aanand L Rai’s Zero alongside Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. The film did not meet the expectations of the audience and hence tanked at the box office.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in these trying times of COVID-19 lockdown, SRK and Gauri have been going their bit by donating funds and PPE kits to the medical staff. He has also given his 4-storey office building as a quarantine facility to the BMC officials.</p>
<p>What do you have to say about the throwback picture?</p>

<h3 id="筆泰沖動曼谷做spa送口罩">&ldquo;筆泰沖動——曼谷做Spa送口罩&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.stheadline.com/stheadline/news_res/2020/02/11/114204/i_640x427_502417371.jpg" alt="img">
筆泰沖動——曼谷做Spa送口罩</p>
<p>正當香港的口罩既缺貨又貴賣之際，其實泰國不少地方都有口罩免費派發，舉例泰國陸軍上星期便於曼谷多個地方免費派發口罩，曼谷Siam Paragon商場都不例外！</p>
<p>在泰國基本上很多本地市民都可以免費得到口罩，其實都是一個很奇怪的現象⋯⋯本地人甚少去搶購口罩，市面出售的口罩之所以會被搶購一空，大多是因為中港遊客和一些居泰港人，尤其一些做網上買賣的。幸好就算真的找不到口罩，總會有四方八面的支援，甚至乎做Spa都有免費口罩派發！</p>
<p>話說鄰近BTS Ploenchit站這一間Plant Day Spa，為了令本地人和遊客都可以有口罩用，結果就推出了新的宣傳策略。你說抽水也好，善心也好，總言之到店內光顧任何服務，便可以免費得到口罩數個，不論本地人抑或遊客都可受惠！</p>
<p>正所謂一舉兩得，估計很快會有更多泰國店舖會以此作為另類吸客招數，都算有生意頭腦，又可以幫到大家。</p>

<p>Fans of K-pop band GOT7 are turning to Twitter to call for the cancelation of the band&rsquo;s upcoming concerts in China&rsquo;s Hong Kong due to safety concerns due to the riots caused the ongoing protests in the city.</p>
<p>The seven-member boy band, whose members include American-Chinese singer Mark Tuan and China&rsquo;s Hong Kong singer Jackson Wang, has scheduled two concerts for August 31 and September 1 as part of their 2019 Keep Spinning World Tour.</p>
<p>Fearing for the safety of GOT 7, especially Jackson Wang, fans have called on the band&rsquo;s agency JYP Entertainment to cancel the concerts through the hashtags #JYPE_CancelGOT7HKConcerts and #JYPE홍콩콘서트취소 on Twitter, which quickly entered the trending list. Fans have posted screenshots of messages threatening the star made under Wang&rsquo;s most recent update on China&rsquo;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo in which he said he is a guardian of China&rsquo;s national flag.</p>
<p>The threatening messages include one&rsquo;s sharing GOT7&rsquo;s flight information and talking about &ldquo;detaining him while tearing the Chinese flag to shreds in front of him,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;forcing him to hold a flag of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Twitter, K-pop fans, including followers of groups like BTS, showed anger toward JYP Entertainment for not canceling the scheduled shows in Hong Kong, noting that other K-pop bands and Chinese singers such as EXO member Zhang Yixing have canceled events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, @jypnation We are worried about the boys safety. Please, cancel GOT7&rsquo;s Hong Kong tour. We, think their safety is a priority. ARMY supporting iGoT7 @GOT7Official #JYPE_GOT7_홍콩콘_취소해 #JYPE_CancelGOT7HKConcerts,&rdquo; tweeted Daniela - 다니엘라.</p>
<p>On GOT7&rsquo;s official Sina Weibo account, Chinese fans have left hundreds of messages asking them to cancel the shows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best solution is cancelation. Otherwise, change it to Guangzhou or Shenzhen,&rdquo; said one user.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I know you won&rsquo;t cancel the shows, please hire more guards for them,&rdquo; said another user.</p>
<p>JYP Entertainment has yet to release any statements about the social media campaign.

<p><img src="https://www.somagnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/45-5-e1579897965391.jpg" alt="img">
It was a nice gesture to commemorate the Chinese celebration.</p>
<p>For much of Asia, the Lunar New Year is one of the most important celebrations. Therefore, it is expected that many of our favorite idols update us during these days with pictures and messages of congratulation regarding the festival .</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/1220617301273133057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1220617301273133057&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nacionrex.com%2Fkpop%2Fbts-ano-nuevo-chino-bt21-celebracion-lunar-fotos-20200124-0001.html">https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/1220617301273133057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1220617301273133057&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nacionrex.com%2Fkpop%2Fbts-ano-nuevo-chino-bt21-celebracion-lunar-fotos-20200124-0001.html</a></p>
<p>Of course, the boys of BTS could not be the exception and, today they have shared through their Facebook page a series of individual photographs of the members using a memorial filter .</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TK_Tannie/status/1220461386913980417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1220461386913980417&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nacionrex.com%2Fkpop%2Fbts-ano-nuevo-chino-bt21-celebracion-lunar-fotos-20200124-0001.html">https://twitter.com/TK_Tannie/status/1220461386913980417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1220461386913980417&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nacionrex.com%2Fkpop%2Fbts-ano-nuevo-chino-bt21-celebracion-lunar-fotos-20200124-0001.html</a></p>
<p>The year that begins according to the Chinese calendar corresponds to that of the rat , so we see Jin , Suga , J-Hope , RM , Jimin , V and Jungkook wearing small white ears and with a ‘ 2020 ‘ whose zeros have little eyes and whiskers. So cute!</p>
<p>Also, watch here the video they showed through their weibo account, where the boys greet their fans and send them their good wishes.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/na201921/status/1220727881132904450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1220727881132904450&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nacionrex.com%2Fkpop%2Fbts-ano-nuevo-chino-bt21-celebracion-lunar-fotos-20200124-0001.html">https://twitter.com/na201921/status/1220727881132904450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1220727881132904450&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nacionrex.com%2Fkpop%2Fbts-ano-nuevo-chino-bt21-celebracion-lunar-fotos-20200124-0001.html</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, weibo account of BT21 also joins the celebration with an image of Tata , Chimmy , Koya , Cookie , Shookie , RJ , Mang and Van piling up in front of a large window where you see the fireworks.</p>
