<p>Charlize Theron is not in any rush—and for very good reasons.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I personally will go back to work any time soon,” she told Vanity Fair. “I have two small kids. I’ve had these recurring dreams—or terrors I should say—that I somehow stupidly got it and brought it back to my kids. I don’t want to mess with this stuff. I feel like there’s a sense of responsibility on everybody’s part to just realize that.”</p>
<p>Hollywood producers and guilds are devising complex new protocols to make casts and crews as safe as possible from the coronavirus. The up-side is clear: firing up America’s filmmaking machine again, restoring tens of thousands of jobs in an important economic sector while creating new movies and TV shows for a world that could use the escape.</p>
<p>But right now, the questions and doubts are still overwhelming, and getting A-list talent back to the set is far from assured. Stars big enough to attract an audience can afford to wait out the virus, and many projects can’t move forward without them. That’s created immense and conflicting pressure—livelihoods vs. actual lives. It’s not about being a diva. Actors, as well as directors, interact constantly with workers from virtually every department, making them not just susceptible to infection but also potential super-spreaders.</p>
<p>“Our industry is one where it’s like a circus,” Theron told Vanity Fair. “We all live under the same tent and it could be really, really dangerous. We’re just going to have to be really careful.”</p>
<p>The Uncertainty Factor</p>
<p>Theron, who runs the Denver and Delilah Productions company, which coproduced her new Netflix film, The Old Guard, is still preparing projects for when principle photography is safe to resume. “We have writing rooms open and stuff like that. So there’s that kind of creative development going on. But I don’t know about actual physical production. I really don’t know when that is going to [return] in the way that we used to know it.”</p>
<p>While guilds and studios work on “white papers” with social distancing procedures, testing guidelines, and quarantine practices, some talent are simply opting to wait indefinitely.</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to some who are like, ‘You know what? I’m taking a year off. I’m just sitting it out,’” said producer Hutch Parker, best known for Logan, who is also a former executive with 20th Century Fox and New Regency. “It’s particularly some older actors who don’t want to put themselves more at risk. Others seem a little bit more confident and a little bit more eager. It does feel to me as we all watch the news and monitor what’s going on in different parts of the country, that you’re seeing the same diversity of reaction in our industry as we’re seeing in the country at large.”</p>
<p>Devising a one-size-fits-all approach that satisfies the concerns of everyone on the call sheet will obviously be an immense challenge. “All these great actors and folks that we’re working with have their own individual thoughts about coming back. But we’re building a plan that puts as much protection around them as we possibly can,” said producer Dan Wilson.</p>
<p>Wilson was working with Parker on a Home Alone reboot for Disney+ when the quarantine hit, as well as on the Venom sequel. The former had begun shooting, the latter was entering postproduction.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to go into an environment that’s going to be risky and that goes for crew members too. It’s not just talent. It’s everybody involved on set,” he said. “There’s a nervousness and that’s natural and understandable. In the plans that we’ve discussed, they’ve certainly taken that into account and we’ll see when we get there, I guess.”</p>
<p>Best Laid Plans</p>
<p>Spike Lee didn’t have to worry about theaters not being open for his upcoming Vietnam war drama, Da 5 Bloods—the movie debuts on Netflix in June—but he was supposed to begin shooting a new film with Legendary Pictures based on the graphic novel Prince of Cats. “It’s Romeo and Juliette during the age of hip-hop. It takes place in the People’s Republic of Brooklyn, New York. I was supposed to be shooting that this summer in New York,” the filmmaker said, then added matter-of-factly: “Not this summer…”

<h3 id="sixties-pop-star-dion-i-started-taking-heroin-at-14">&ldquo;Sixties pop star Dion: &lsquo;I started taking heroin at 14&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2020/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000231967463_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5o15DP0W_h39LCMR14G1agFIqa1gNJtdjPRb1xxn9ys.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay" alt="img">
There aren’t many original rock ’n’ rollers still standing. One of the very best, Little Richard, died earlier this month. But there’s Dion: if not quite the last man standing, possibly the last great American musician from the dawn of the genre who’s still rockin’ and rollin’ as vigorously as ever.</p>
<p>Sixty years on from groundbreaking hits Runaround Sue and The Wanderer, the 80-year-old is releasing Blues With Friends. It’s a 14-track, self-written set that is what it says on the tin: a tribute to the genre featuring Dion fans and acolytes including Bruce Springsteen, Van Morrison, Paul Simon and Jeff Beck.</p>
<p>The album features sleeve notes by another old friend, Bob Dylan, who attributes Dion’s success to two teachers: his “vaudevillian father and the doo-wop street corners of the Bronx”.</p>
<p>The pair go way back, not least to sharing the distinction of being the only two contemporary artists featured on the sleeve of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – John Lennon was a huge fan of Ruby Baby, the 1962 Dion hit that was a mainstay of The Beatles’ Hamburg sets.</p>
<p>The all-star album is accompanied by a photograph in which the remarkably well-preserved singer-songwriter clutches a guitar. Its body is covered in the names of his friends, heroes and peers, from Duane Eddy to Johnny Cash to Elvis Presley. But scrawled at the top, first among equals, is Little Richard.</p>
<p>“He and Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and Bo Diddley were the mainstays for me,” the man born Dion DiMucci tells me down the line from his home in Boca Raton, Florida. “When I first started out, they were dancing across my living room on my TV set. For me, they were from outer space!”</p>
<p>Within a year, the scrappy Italian-American kid was sharing the stage with Richard at New York venue The Brooklyn Fox.

<p>My dad used to play Fela Kuti records to me – some of my earliest musical memories are those records playing in the car. Later on I wondered who played the drums: oh, it’s this guy Tony Allen. He became my superstar.</p>
<p>It was the sound of Nigeria in a rhythm. It’s that undeniable groove that makes you want to dance, and that’s what I think and feel when I’m around Nigerians. It’s an energy, it’s a force; it’s not aggressive but it’s not tame. When a Nigerian’s in the room, you know a Nigerian’s in the room, and that’s how I feel about Tony’s playing: once he lays that beat on a Fela track it’s here to stay for the next half an hour.</p>
<p>Tony said he’d heard good things about me, and asked when was I gonna come and see him. I said: “Any time!” Like an ignorant Londoner I just assumed he lived in London, only to find out he lives in Paris. One of my friends told me you can get the Megabus there – say no more. I got it at 11pm, arriving in Paris at 6am. I would walk around Paris aimlessly for hours, and then I’d have a drum lesson with him in the afternoon. But it was more than a lesson: we would sit down, hang out, eat. He was fun, he had a youthful buzz about him. He was grateful for life. It was like hanging out with an old uncle. He was awfully grumpy in the mornings, but by the evening he was great.</p>
<p>He laughed when I was playing and said: “Why is everything so aggressive?” I was like: “What do you mean? It’s the drums, man, that’s what they’re for!” So for the first few lessons we worked on playing Fela Kuti beats really quietly together, really trying to get inside all the things about music that make a drum beat powerful, apart from sheer force.</p>

<p>Another thing I got from him is how many ways there are to make people dance. Are you going to lay the most simple beat to keep a platform for everyone else, or something more complicated? I got all that from him. Whether I’m playing with Jorja Smith or Ezra Collective, you’ll always hear something I can directly point towards and say: I learned that from Tony Allen. He’s the biggest musical influence on my playing, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Questlove, Chris Dave, Moses Boyd – these are all people I know are directly influenced by Tony too, but none of us can make a beat sit down and groove like he did. It’s so weird, because it’s not even that hard. You’ll look at the notes, what he’s doing, and you’re like: right, I can play everything in the right place. But when he does it, it just sounds better. Like when a really great narrator reads a sentence, it just has an authority to it that you couldn’t give, even if you can read the same sentence. He had a special gift.</p>

<p>I’ve known Tony since the late 80s. I had never met someone so positive, it was crazy. With Tony, it’s always about what can make the music beautiful, what can bring music to people’s hearts, what can make them dance. He never bitched about anything, never blamed anyone for anything.</p>
<p>He stayed as long as he could with the oppression in Nigeria with Fela. For his own sake, he had to leave to have a career. But was really grateful of the experience of being at the forefront, at the roots of Afrobeat. With Fela’s band, the horns, the singing, everybody can go wherever they want, because they know when they come back, they know there’s something holding them: Tony. He completely changed the way of playing drums: instead of hitting them hard, he put the percussionist’s role into the drums. The cowbell is always the driver of Afrobeat, and that’s why he plays so laid back. I’m looking at him, like: “You don’t even sweat. I’m singing and sweating – come on Tony, man, don’t rub it in, sweat a little bit!” But he said: “No, I never sweat.”</p>
<p>Remain in Light by Talking Heads was influenced by Fela’s album Afrodisiac, so when I covered it, the whole thing was about bringing rock’n’roll back to Africa. I wanted to pay tribute to the courage of Talking Heads by not copying Afrodisiac but understanding the trance induced by the drums from west Africa. So I said to Tony: “Let’s bring it back home.” We worked together again on Celia, my album of Celia Cruz songs, and afterwards Tony said: “Now we have to do our own project together.” I said: “I would love that, but we should add Manu Dibango and do a killer album.” And here we are, we didn’t have a chance to start working [Dibango died in March]. This news is beginning to feel painful and heavy to carry – I’m a little bit sore right now.</p>
<p>In a music business that is really dominated by men, it’s very hard to find a real gentleman. Manu Dibango is one, Tony Allen is one, and Hugh Masekela. The woman and person that I am, they respect it, before even respecting the artist that I am, and that is something that I derive my strength from. It’s very hard when you’re a woman in this business, and on top of that you’re an African woman, you’re black? God help you. And so to have such strong men who look at you and say: “What are you afraid of? Go for it, we’ll be here”? I’m flying high.</p>
<p>Tony didn’t speak much. He listened, and he had that smile: I’m sitting at my drums, and I’m in heaven. He would then look at me, and say: “Are you ready?” And he hit and I followed. You look at his hands, and his whole body – he’s like a painter, a storyteller, he’s just building everything around him. And you think, OK, this house is sturdy, I’m going to sit in it and do whatever I have to do.</p>
<p>When I was doing the album Eve, I went back to Benin and cut some tracks with drummers there, and as soon as you say Tony Allen, they go: “Oh my God, it’s because of him that I’m doing drums.” In the new generation of Afrobeats that’s coming from Africa, Tony is at the centre of it – he allows the youth today to cut and paste, do whatever they want to do with that rhythm. Afrobeats is also proof of the back and forth of music that left Africa to go to Europe and come back. It’s a constant exchange, it’s non-stop – trying to stop it is like trying to fight immigration, it’s impossible. And Tony is at the epicentre of it. He’s the foundation of the house.</p>

<p>Aged 25, I was playing a role in a movie by Quentin Dupieux, aka Mr Oizo. At night, the sound engineer would play a lot of Fela Kuti: super involving, a real discovery for me, and I was totally fascinated by the drums. Six months later, I was in Paris talking with friends and I said: “Oh la la, my favourite drummer is the drummer of Fela.” Someone said: “You know his name is Tony Allen? And he lives in Paris, in a very strange place – La Défense.” Tony Allen is living in the business centre of Paris?! OK – I will call him for my new song.</p>
<p>This was La Ritournelle, a very important song for me. I already had the chords, the melody, and I was looking for a drummer. Tony asked for the music before he came in the studio, so he listened a lot to the piano. He was working a lot, but not playing – he was thinking about the music. Tony was a very intellectual guy. And at one point, boom, he’s ready. I need maybe 15 or 20 takes to be happy, but Tony was a one-take guy. Maybe two, to be nice.</p>
<p>I kept the entire take, I didn’t do an edit of it. You can put the instruments in the computer and edit everything, but with Tony it was impossible to do that – the drums are too complicated. It’s like a big river. It’s a very human style of drumming, a lot of feelings, with a real story inside, and so if you edit it, you destroy the story.</p>
<p>Before Tony, La Ritournelle was good, I liked the chords. But when Tony played, it was really magic. He chose to start the ride cymbal when the singing starts – you have maybe six minutes with the hi-hat, and when I sing, he moves to the ride. It gave a magical touch to the song, it was a brilliant idea. This guy was really a genius of drums. It’s impossible to explain where the snare and kick is – it’s like a fantastic salad, full of different little parts.</p>
<p>He also brought a very good ambience to the studio – of international cool. Tony always wore a good outfit, super good sportswear. He was like a fantastic grandpa, kind of fragile but intense, and drinking a lot, smoking a lot. Like – a lot. The guy was always with a cloud of smoke around him. He was very discreet; he never told me: “You know I played with Fela Kuti, you know I invented Afrobeat?” Mega humble, super nice, a high level of coolness. The outfits, the way he talks, the eyes: someone very cool and very intelligent. Small, polite, but with a huge aura.</p>
<p>It was almost impossible to play this music on stage because I couldn’t find any drummer who could play the Tony parts. He was an old man, and it wasn’t really possible to do a tour like mine. So I always ask the new drummer: “Yeah, could you play La Ritournelle exactly like Tony?” And it was just impossible. It’s a very mysterious way to play drums. I guess it’s because he learned to play drums by himself, he didn’t take lessons, so he created another way to play.</p>

<p>Drummers like him are why guys decided to make drum machines, because the beats were so complex. Tony’s music had a certain type of flow and rhythm that is like a piece of gold for a DJ: it would take a person to a higher level, and it didn’t matter who you were or what you liked or where you were from, it had a very universal effect.</p>
<p>My manager told me that Tony Allen had rented out a studio in Paris and was inviting artists to come in and just jam. It was a very simple, brief meeting – he didn’t say much, we talked for a little bit, and then we set up and we started to play. And then we got into long conversations about everything – life and music.</p>
<p>We toured together as a duo and there were no rehearsals – we just took to the stage and played what we felt. The set list was “spontaneity”, and to me, that’s the highest form of communicating through music. We talked about politics or something up until the second that we took the stage, and then when we played together, we were emphasising those thoughts because they were still in our heads.</p>
<p>He was a very kind person. He always liked to tell you things he’s learned in the past, so that you don’t make the same mistake. One of the last conversations we had, I asked him if life, or this world, was as crazy then as it was now, and he said: “Yeah, it was always crazy.” That gave me a little bit of reassurance that we’re not experiencing anything unusual.</p>
<p>I asked him: “This way you’re playing the snare, where did that come from?” And he said that when he was growing up in Lagos, in one given day you’re going to speak four or five different languages. That carried over into the nightlife – the snare was speaking these multiple languages, and he taught me that you are never quite sure who the music is speaking to, so speak to everyone. He told me someone once asked him: “Where’s the one [the lead beat]?” Because it’s difficult to see where the rhythm starts. He explained that the one is everywhere, and it really depends on the listeners, where they come in and where they leave. So he was always showing me things, and teaching. We would have eye contact during our performances, and he would let me know if something was interesting or not.</p>
<p>After the first few performances, I went home, went to a music store and bought as much percussion as I could – as an electronic musician I was programming machines to the point where I never really used my hands. What I was really looking for was something I had in my own character, and I never would have realised that had I not listened to him. When it comes to showing a higher level of rhythm, and approaching that in a very organic way, I don’t think there’s anyone that I will meet that will show me as much as he did.</p>

<p>I asked him to come and play on my 2003 album Love Trap. With my previous album, Salt Rain, I had explored an axis of Europe, India and Africa, and this was an extension of that – we managed to find a musical space that was big enough to house all of those different elements, and I think Tony was proud of achieving that. He knew a lot about music, more than just groove. Sometimes you would hear him playing at soundcheck and you’d feel this immense depth and weight, almost like it’s been going on forever. He once said to me, my drumming is never-ending, and that’s the feeling you got from him.</p>
<p>He was very easy to play with – he didn’t have an ego. He wore his legend quite lightly, and was kind and charming. We share a birthday, and we would phone each other up each year for the last 15 years. When he came to London he would come and visit us, and play you his new music, and it was like … you know how teenagers are when they’ve got a new demo? He had that childlike demeanour. He was always so enthusiastic about life and music, he had a real zest for living.</p>

<p>Not many drummers have redefined drum language. It’s kind of like what J Dilla did for drummers – even though he wasn’t a drummer, what he did with the MPC [sampler] changed the way drummers played. Tony is one of those innovators, like Elvin Jones, like Tony Williams – you can’t come up after Tony and not be influenced by what his contribution to the drums is. He is almost in a world of his own.</p>
<p>I first met him in 2016 and ever since I’d always run into him hanging or playing with someone. He was a lot of fun, and he had a lot of time for musicians. He was this funky, youthful 79-year-old. He became very uncle-like, and loved a good time, always had some whisky or weed.</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky enough to meet and talk with a lot of the masters, like Roy Hargrove, Roy Haynes, James Moody, Jimmy Heath – they all had the same youthful inquisitiveness. Tony too, it felt like he was fresh and ready to take on whatever the show was. Not everyone’s blessed like that, some people get stuck in their thing, and that’s cool – they like to do what they do. But Tony always seemed wide open.</p>

<p>In the mid-80s, I used to DJ at Electric Ballroom in Camden on a Friday night. Upstairs was what they called the jazz room, where all the dancers would dance off and battle. Two Fela Kuti tracks that Tony Allen played on, Roforofo Fight and Shakara, were two of the most essential tracks that I had. Not only were they incredible, but they were also long, and allowed for a serious battle to ensue.</p>
<p>From Fatboy Slim playing Roforofo Fight at Glastonbury to Q-Tip playing it at Output to Louie Vega playing it in Tokyo, any DJ playing any kind of music, whether it’s hip-hop, house or disco, will have been saved at least once by a Tony Allen track. Whenever I saw him, I felt like I should pay him a percentage of my fee. The songs were generally quite long, so they always gave you enough time to get your head together – if you’re slightly nervous and need to settle into the zone, start with a Fela track. Or if you need a toilet break.</p>
<p>His music worked at 90bpm as well as it worked at 140bpm, that was the other magic about it. Even the slower stuff – Water No Get Enemy, Fear Not for Man – is brutally powerful in the same way roots reggae is, or heavy dubstep by Mala. It was almost like he created a beat that was ahead of the drum machine, it was so constant. And if you’re used to dancing on the fourth beat, you can fall into a four within his beat, but if you want to dance to the offbeat, you can find that too. There’s several different rhythms to latch on to, depending on what you like. And that’s really powerful – he’s managed to incorporate the swing and the hypnotic, two very different areas. You really have to mess up, or the crowd has to really suck, if they don’t dance to Tony Allen records.</p>

<p>Tony Allen marked all of my childhood – I used to dance a lot to his Afrobeat music. It was one of my dreams to collaborate with him and I finally realised it: he gifted me with his magic touch on my last album, Mogoya, playing drums on the tracks Yere Faga and Fadjamou. He is one of the most legendary musicians of all time because he knew how to play and adapt himself to all genres of music. He was a kind, generous and smart man. You marked your era, my brother. You will remain forever in our memories – rest in peace.</p>

<p>I did a remix for him, and then got in touch with him to give me a good backbeat for the Moritz von Oswald Trio I had formed. I’m a drummer myself, and Tony was like somebody from another world. How he kept the beat, how steady it was, it was so upfront and so precise – he was like a drum machine with soul. He was playing not only beats, but melodies – his drums were singing, you know?</p>
<p>In my studio, we set up my drum kit and he was so happy to sit behind it. It’s like I could feel his destination. It was so genius how he did his contributions to this steady electronic beat, how he loosened it up. He was never trying to put himself in the foreground, only support. And it was so complex. He was giving so much that it was almost enough on its own. I thought of making him the first person, changing the whole role of having a drummer. Usually a drummer is used as a backbeat, and I love that, but sometimes I was thinking to exchange these old conservative roles, and have him being the one that’s the main musician, and me add synth music to his playing. We never tried, but it would have been great to do it.</p>
<p>His playing was impossible to copy because no one in the world would be able to play it. And it was so light, as if it was floating – maybe the same as his personality! We had some beautiful times together. He was kind of a father figure, always embracing people, very humble. Kind of the same as he was behind the kit. We talked about our problems; we had some beautiful conversations about family and friendship. He was 75 when we played with him and we went to Japan, Australia, but he never argued or moaned. He was fighting through for playing, and you could see when you looked into his eyes that he really loved to play. He was a close friend – I felt like a son to him. And he was a genius, no?

<h3 id="behind-the-song-james-taylor-fire-and-rain--american-songwriter">&ldquo;Behind The Song: James Taylor, “Fire and Rain” « American Songwriter&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/28091828/James-Taylor-Sweet-Baby-James-Album-Cover.jpg" alt="img">
James Taylor arrived in a time when pop music was shifting. A particular brand of singer-songwriter, along with the likes of Carole King and Joni Mitchell, had emerged. Taylor fit the bill, too, offering up his own smooth, evocative tenor and way of songwriting that pierced right to the heart. His first major hit, 1970’s “Fire and Rain,” from his second album, Sweet Baby James, cemented him early on as a pillar of talent, a beacon that would soon completely upend the establishment.</p>
<p>“Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone / Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you,” he sings. His words are introspective, sorrowful, and somehow urgent. “I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song / I just can’t remember who to send it to.”</p>
<p>That opening verse, depicting the tragic suicide of dear friend Suzanne Schnerr, certainly set the heart-rending tone. Having met in New York in the late ‘60s, they “used to hang out together and we used to get high together; I think she came from Long Island,” Taylor is quoted in 2001’s “James Taylor: Long Ago And Far Away,” a biography written by former Billboard Magazine editor-in-chief Timothy White. “She was a kid, like all of us.”</p>
<p>When Taylor was recording his debut album, 1968’s self-titled, for the Beatles’ Apple Records in London, Schnerr took her own life, but Taylor wouldn’t know about it until much later. “At the time I was living with friends, and all three of them were really close to Susie. But Richard and Joel and Margaret were excited for me having this record deal and making this album,” he says, “and when Susie killed herself they decided not to tell me about it until later because they didn’t want to shake me up. I didn’t find out until some six months after it happened.”</p>
<p>“Fire and Rain,” containing a sweeping, orchestral undercurrent, came to him pretty quickly. It was a song that “relieved a lot of sort of tension,” as he tells it in an interview with NPR back in 2000. “There [were] things that I needed to get rid of or at least get out of me or get in front of me or at least have some other relationship than feeling them internally, either by telling somebody else or by just putting them out in a form in front of me so that I could say, `There they are,’ you know, externalizing it somehow. And that part was hard, having the feelings that needed to be expressed in that way. But it was actually a relief, like a laugh or a sigh.”</p>
<p>Where the first verse deals with suicide, the second verse turns inward, depicting his struggle with addiction. “Won’t you look down upon me, Jesus / You’ve got to help me make a stand / You’ve just got to see me through another day,” he weeps, attempting to glue the pieces back together. “My body’s aching and my time is at hand / And I won’t make it any other way.”</p>
<p>Upon returning from London, he was “surprised that I’d picked up a habit. So I was physically very uncomfortable and having a rough time,” he shares with NPR.</p>
<p>Then, on the third verse, he makes reference to various mental hospital stays, including McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, bouts of heavy depression, and a former band named The Flying Machine, which resulted in a sour end and severe personal and professional implications. The darkness seemed never-ending.</p>
<p>He laments:</p>
<p>Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun</p>
<p>Lord knows when the cold wind blows it’ll turn your head around</p>
<p>Well, there’s hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come</p>
<p>Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground</p>
<p>“Fire and Rain,” which he estimated in 2000 that he had performed thousands of times in his career, stands as among his crowning achievements. While the emotional punch has certainly flattened for him, he remains awe-struck when his audience remains so deeply connected to his words.</p>
<p>The song ultimately rose to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

<h3 id="the-masked-singer-rhoas-kandi-burruss-couldve-been-the-taco">&ldquo;The Masked Singer: RHOA&rsquo;s Kandi Burruss Could&rsquo;ve Been the Taco&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&amp;c=sc&amp;poi=%5B720%2C258%5D&amp;w=1500&amp;h=785&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F05%2F21%2Fmasked-singer-night-angel.jpg" alt="img">
Kandi Burruss couldn’t sugar-coat her excitement when she cried out with joy after winning The Masked Singer on Wednesday night and taking off her Night Angel costume.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” Burruss, 44, tells PEOPLE of the victory. “I&rsquo;m all about girl power, so I was just so happy that I could pull through to the end for all the women. I didn&rsquo;t even realize when I first started the show that no woman had ever won before, even though I did watch both seasons, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about it in that way. As I started going forward I was like, I got to pull through it.”</p>

<p>Through the season, the Real Housewives of Atlanta star talked about wanting to win the competition for her kids Riley, 17, Ace, 4, and Blaze, 5 months. She also found confidence as a solo artist after years of performing with Xscape.</p>
<p>“I always had a love of singing and songwriting,” says Burruss, who penned hits for Destiny’s Child and TLC. “I&rsquo;ve always wanted to continue to do music. But I just wasn&rsquo;t doing it. And now I&rsquo;m making it a priority for myself. This is what I love. I don&rsquo;t know why I got so caught up in everything else. Just like anybody, as you get older you start thinking about what makes money, not necessarily always go on with your passion. But music is my passion. Whether it&rsquo;s writing it or singing it, it&rsquo;s my passion.”</p>
<p>The reality star opens up about her Masked Singer journey, Real Housewives reunion drama and staying home with two young kids and a teenager.</p>
<p>What is a night angel and why did you pick that costume?</p>
<p>The Night Angel to me, she&rsquo;s an angel so she has such a sweet, nice side to her but then there&rsquo;s a dark side too, which I think is really cool. I was supposed to be somebody else from the beginning. They gave me three different options. They gave me the Taco option, and then I think it was another one that was similar to the costume that Chaka Khan had. And then it was another one, which I can&rsquo;t say because nobody used it. The other one is the one I had picked. I wanted something with pants because I wanted to be able to move around. And then they called me like a week or two after I picked my costume, I had gotten fitted and everything and they were like, we had another option, how would you like this? And when I saw Night Angel I was like, oh most definitely. This is what I need in my life.</p>
<p>Did your kids know you were doing the show?</p>
<p>My daughter Riley actually was very good at helping me pick some of the songs, because in the beginning you got to send in a list of songs that you&rsquo;re interested in possibly performing, and so my mom and Riley were both like, “What about this song? What about that song?”</p>
<p>Did your Xscape bandmates immediately recognize your voice?</p>
<p>I’m sure they did, but they never said anything to me. If anybody knows my voice, they know my voice, but they didn&rsquo;t say anything, so they were just letting me do my thing. I saw Tiny did interviews and people were asking her about it and she was just being very coy, so I knew she knew it was me. But she was playing along with the secret.</p>

<p>It’s a big week for you because you also have the Housewives reunion going on. How was it filming that virtually?</p>
<p>That was hilarious. I did not think that we were really going to be able to pull it off. In my mind I&rsquo;m like, how are we going to argue with each other over a laptop? But when it happened, I was shocked because we were extremely passionate about getting our points across, so passionate to the point where they had to mute. It turned out to be a really crazy reunion.</p>

<p>What can you tease about how the fight between you and Nene Leakes will or will not resolve itself in the final part of the reunion?</p>
<p>It does not resolve itself. She&rsquo;s still being a hater right now.</p>
<p>Do you think the Masked Singer exposure is going to fuel her even more?</p>
<p>I mean, I know she has been talking about me, but it&rsquo;s all good. [Before the reveal] I was laughing to myself like, if she only knew. But it&rsquo;s cool. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t really care too much about what she says. I don&rsquo;t mind it. I&rsquo;ve been on for 11 seasons — at this point, we say what we say about each other, but I don&rsquo;t really take anything she has to say to heart. I know we will argue because we&rsquo;re like oil and water, we don&rsquo;t necessarily mix, but I don&rsquo;t take it to heart. I don&rsquo;t have any hate for her or anything like that. I&rsquo;m not letting anything get me down at all.</p>
<p>Especially with your new song “Used to Love Me,” you&rsquo;re already doing so well! Why did you want to make a dance song?</p>
<p>When you can start off in an urban R&amp;B group, everybody wants you to stay in that lane and I didn&rsquo;t want to be too stuck in one lane anymore. And the show really helps with that because I felt like I had so many genres of music while I was on the show and that was intentional. I can do whatever I want to do, I don&rsquo;t have to be stuck in a box. I wanted to do a song that was more dance and club instead of an urban R&amp;B record. My last album was a lot more slow songs and I remember people being like, we need more to dance to. So I wanted to give people something that just made you want to move. I wanted to do a song that reached everybody worldwide.</p>
<p>Are there any plans for an album or a tour when you can?</p>
<p>I definitely want to do an album. I plan to release it in the coming months. But I really wanted to do a tour. When I first won, because it was before this quarantine happened, I had all these plans and all these things out there to do. And then our whole world got shut down. I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll be able to tour .but my husband was like, maybe I can do like a virtual concert or something like that. I think that can be fun, so I think I&rsquo;m going to put something like that together.</p>
<p>How is your restaurant in Atlanta doing amid coronavirus? You had said The Old Lady Gang (a clue on the show!) pivoted to takeout like so many others.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what we had to end up doing. The Old Lady Gang, our restaurant, it&rsquo;s been good, but obviously not as we normally do when we&rsquo;re able to open our doors. Georgia opened back up, so everybody&rsquo;s trying to figure out how to open safely, so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing right now, making plans. We’re re-doing a lot of the tables and stuff so we can social distance properly and all of that. Our plan is to open up in June, next month. And so we&rsquo;re setting up.</p>
<p>How has it been being home with two young kids during all of this?</p>
<p>Blaze, she is a happy baby. She is always smiling, and she&rsquo;s just great every day. But she definitely likes to be held and picked up, so having two small ones, he always wants somebody to play with him, so that can be challenging at times. But everybody in the house is pitching in to make sure we could keep them happy.

<h3 id="well-this-is-awkward-christine-and-the-queens-and-troye-sivan-make-post-pandemic-plans">&ldquo;“Well, This Is Awkward”: Christine and the Queens and Troye Sivan Make Post-Pandemic Plans&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/F5EDuXiw-1000x561.jpeg" alt="img">
Héloïse Adelaïde Letissier couldn’t possibly have predicted a global pandemic, but she’s made the most of it. In the early days of quarantine, the French musician, who writes and performs as Christine and the Queens, was a constant presence on Instagram Live, hosting performances from Ferber studios in Paris. She kicked off the livestreams with a rendition of”People, I’ve Been Sad,” the lead single off her latest EP, La vita nuova. The song is an anthem for introverts, as Christine sings about being gone and missing out for way too long against the backdrop of a jello-thick beat. Her melancholic electro-pop, which she mastered on her 2018 breakout Chris, has always felt both familiar and prophetic. Her queer androgyny calls to mind David Bowie and his spawn of glam-rock gods, while encapsulating a gender-fluid future in which the only rule is honesty.</p>
<p>Christine’s collaborations with Charli XCX and Caroline Polachek, along with her stripped down, choreographed covers of Beyoncé, Neil Young, and more, have skyrocketed her far beyond the confines of her minimalist France apartment, yet it’s unsurprising that it’s there where she thrives. In lockdown by herself for the last month-and-a-half, Christine has found herself at work on a new album, one that she hopes will sound like “the start of a dream.” Last week, she hopped on a transcontinental phone call with fellow queer pop phenom, Troye Sivan, to talk about making new music in isolation, dance therapy, and the freedom of rejecting bad advice.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>TROYE SIVAN: How are you, Chris?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I’m okay. How are you? You’re calling from Australia, right?</p>
<p>SIVAN: Yeah. Everything is good here. Our healthcare is awesome. Our COVID cases are low, but our internet is terrible. I think the last time I spoke to you, we were DMing, and you were telling me that you were isolating by yourself. Is that still the case?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Well, I kind of broke the rule because in France, we are exiting strict lockdown, so we were allowed to see friends. So I kind of started to see my friends again. Thank god, because it was starting to be a bit too much introspection. I was like, “Maybe I should stop the diving inwards because I don’t know what it did to me.”</p>
<p>SIVAN: Come on. How long were you by yourself for?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I think in total, I was alone for a full month-and-a-half. So it’s quite a lot, I guess.</p>
<p>SIVAN: It is. I went to Australia, so I’ve been with my family. I feel like a 17-year-old kid again. I live with my parents and my three siblings and our dog. I just feel like I got transported back in time, but I didn’t have to deal with any of the real loneliness. I’m very relieved. I feel like you’ve been extraordinarily productive and creative during this time. Is that right?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Well, yeah. I think the loneliness helped because I was just focused on what I wanted to do as an artist. I had basically nothing left around me. I chose to self-isolate because I needed that time for a second. It’s been crazy for two years, and I never tried to be properly alone. I also covered lots of songs I love. I wanted to maintain a link with people because I felt, as a performer, a bit frustrated.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I’ve been loving watching your Instagram covers. In fact, I think my favorite was the “Blinding Lights” cover. I’m just flabbergasted because all of us are singing into our mics, and still auto-tuning the shit out of our voices. Then you’re just standing in this room singing into your iPhone and performing. It’s so amazing.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Oh, merci. Means a lot. Have you been writing?</p>
<p>SIVAN: No, I’ve been really lucky because I had wrote a lot before everything got crazy, so I’ve been sitting on music. For me, the process has been much more based around visuals, and planning, and just spending time online communicating with the people that listen to my music because I don’t know that I could write at the moment with the Zoom sessions and stuff. I always co-write because I don’t produce, so Zoom sessions to me just don’t seem very inspiring. I don’t know that I can get my head around it.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I’ve been only starting to. For me, there are two stages. Usually, I work and pre-produce everything, so I work on Logic, and I kind of shape the production and write the song. This is the stage I’m at. I’ve been writing maybe 15 songs.</p>
<p>SIVAN: Oh my god.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Well, what can I say? I don’t have many friends. No, I’m joking.</p>
<p>SIVAN: What’s it sounding like? Can I ask?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I actually already have a precise direction, but this is a moment where I don’t want to spoil because it’s going to be fun. We’re so early in the process of talking about it. Actually, in lockdown, I just found the mood. It was kind of surprising, and it turned out quite powerful. It’s a vibe.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I’m very, very, very excited to hear it. If you ever want to leak some music, send it my way.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I’ll probably debrief you and send you a PDF at some point.</p>
<p>SIVAN: What’s been inspiring you while you’re sitting alone in your apartment?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I think in lockdown I emerged with kind of like a teenage-y feeling. I reminisced a lot about what music meant to me at that point, and why I fell in love with it, and the concept of dreaming. I wanted to make something that could make people properly fantasize and dream. When I listened to Björk, I was just like, “Oh, this is a dream.” You fall asleep listening to the music. I was like, “Oh, let’s make a record that could be the start of a dream for people.”</p>
<p>SIVAN: That’s so beautiful. If anything, this time has just made me feel so grateful to—it sounds cheesy to say, but for the creative spirit that I think we’re lucky enough to have in our lives. I don’t know about you, but I feel like we’ve both sort of gone insane being locked up without being able to make something.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Definitely. I found myself grateful to have songwriting as something that could help me through. I feel that the albums that are coming out, like the Fiona Apple album, arrived perfectly. It kind of soothed me really intensely, and the Perfume Genius one, too. You actually released a track sooner than decided, right? Was it because you felt that people could receive it at that moment?</p>
<p>SIVAN: I think it was a mixture of things. There was the very selfish reason that I felt like I needed something at that moment to keep my brain occupied. I guess when you feel like everything is spinning out of control, there’s something about being able to give yourself some sort of project and, hopefully, also give people something to think about and feel. I had this song that was not at all about what was going on in the world. I wrote it a few months before all of this started happening, but then re-listening to it, it completely changed meanings to me. It was kind of like a coping mechanism, and also, I really wanted to employ a bunch of people because I’m still so worried about my band, my crew, and everyone. Our industry’s taken a real hit.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about dance because I would pay infinite dollars to be able to move like you can move. I want to know if you can relate it to me in music form. Singing is something that I’ve just always done around the house. It’s something that I do when I’m in my feelings or whatever. Does dance feel similar? When you need to release, what’s the first thing that you do? Do you get up, put on music, and start moving just because you can?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Well, first of all, you can move. I saw the video of “My My My!” and it’s swaggy as hell.</p>
<p>SIVAN: Thank you.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: To be honest, at my house, my mom was dancing a lot, but really spontaneously. Sometimes if she loved the music, she would stand up and dance. When I was a teenager, I was super embarrassed about it, but actually, I realize I’m exactly the same. Before I made music, I wanted to be a set director, so I went to see lots of different plays. I saw a piece by Pina Bausch , and it changed my life. I was like, “Dancing can express something that words cannot contain.” It can help with everything—with sex, with grief, with love. It’s like poetry. You like it. You practice it. You think about it. You hate it, and then you take it again.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I think it’s almost impossible to not be joyous when you dance. Or not even joyous, just getting that release.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Well, I think the concept of release is really well-expressed because there is something cathartic about it.</p>
<p>SIVAN: Do you dance when you’re writing in the studio?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: When I know the song is good. It’s like a detector of if the song is going to work for me. If I start to bounce, it’s usually a really good sign. If I’m not moving, that song is not going to make the cut.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I feel like that’s the greatest feeling in the world, when you’re in the studio, and suddenly, you don’t know how it happens, but everyone’s on their feet. You’ve collaborated with Charli XCX, Caroline Polachek, and Perfume Genius. I love all of these people so much. How are you picking these incredible people?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: It’s true that they are incredible. Every time, it was really different. I used to be a solid loner and quite insecure about collaborating because I was like, “I’m not a proper singer.” I was riddled with insecurities, so I ended up collaborating with people with whom I felt really comfortable with on the human scale. For example, the Perfume Genius collaboration was something that I had to try because I know him, and it’s a problem. When we were doing the song, I just wanted to wave at him for some reason. Then with Charli, it became a really fluid conversation that ended up in a song. She was one of the first people who made me super comfortable about being myself and collaborating freely without the pressure of something that has to work.</p>
<p>SIVAN: At the end of day, I love that we’re all sort of pop music nerds. Those are the people that I want to collaborate with—the people that you can really geek out with and get excited over what you’re doing. This is the most annoying question in the entire world because I also get it all the time, but I genuinely am so curious. Is there somebody that you haven’t collaborated with yet that you really want to?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Well, this is awkward because you’re on the line, and I could say it’s you, so now you feel cornered.</p>
<p>SIVAN: You do not have to say that. You can give the real answer.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Well, it’s part of the real answer. I’ve been waiting. Sorry, I have to be honest and transparent. It feels like I’m cornering you, but you’re on my list of people I’d really like to collaborate with one day.</p>
<p>SIVAN: Thank you so much. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: No, my team can confirm.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I’d say in a heartbeat we should make it happen. I’ll DM you after we get off the phone. One thing I really love about your work is it all feels very, very free and very, very queer to me. I wanted to talk to you about the queer musical landscape at the moment. I really want to know how it was performing at the Drag Race finale.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: It was a blast as expected. Honestly, the vibe was mind-blowing. You were a jury member at some point, right?</p>
<p>SIVAN: It was literally the best day of my life.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I know. Every single person on the team is lovely, and the crowd was amazing and then they were so nice to me. They were like, “You can do a runway now.” I was like, “What?” They were like, “Yeah, do the runway,” and the whole venue clapped. I was like, “Okay. Okay. This is a bit too much for me.”</p>
<p>SIVAN: Oh my god.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I feel like I was bathed in love and acceptance for a whole night. It fueled me in energy for two months after that. This was the only time in my career where Christine and the Queens actually made sense as a name. It was finally happening. I was like, “Yes, Christine and the Queens. That’s what I’m talking about.”</p>
<p>SIVAN: That’s so good.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Yeah, I know. I don’t really know how to establish a state of queer music because I don’t know what queer music is, because I don’t know what queer means. I think queer should be a question. So I’m always a bit wary of those digests: “queer artists to watch out for” and “new queer music,” because I think sometimes there’s something deeply queer happening inside something quite patriarchal. I think something disruptive is deeply queer, and sometimes I think when we gloss over the concept of queerness, it kind of dissolves. So I’m really just watching and observing, but I’m not really sure I know where it stands.</p>
<p>For me, being queer means that at some point, I had to disrupt something to exist because the existing norm is what’s suffocating me. There’s this element of breaking free. I think what is queer in music and artists are the element of disruption, and hybridity, and the assertion of doubt. For example, someone like Arca has a whole gesture that starts with sound, but ends with her body. It’s all about mutating, in a way. I think the element of mutation, of shape-shifting, is really important for me.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I feel like all of the nuance, the beautiful individuality that is queerness, you’ve just stated that in such a perfect way. I struggle to do that. So I’m just really blown away. I think that’s totally on the money. What is the worst piece of advice that anyone has ever given you?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I remember precisely what it was. I was starting to be noticed a bit in France, so I had meetings with record labels. This guy looked at me and he was like, “Well, you should be more sexy. You’re not sexy enough. You’ll never sign anywhere.” And look what happened next. I don’t know if the guy is still around. Of course, it’s a white guy who told me that.</p>
<p>SIVAN: Oh my god.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I know.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I mean, there’s two approaches. Number one, reach across the table, or, number two, just leave and go absolutely kill it everywhere else. I feel like you did the latter.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: What he was really saying was “be more in the male gaze,” but then what happened after that was deeply satisfying, because I didn’t have to play the male gaze to succeed as an artist. What was your worst advice you ever received?</p>
<p>SIVAN: Right after I came out of the closet, I had a person in my life tell me , “I’m very proud of you that you came out, but that doesn’t mean you should go around and shove it in everyone’s face, and be candid and flamboyant and all that stuff.” I’m thankful that, even at that time, at 15 or 16, I had enough of a sense of self that I thought, “Fuck you.” Then I got off the phone and never thought about it again.</p>
<p>SIVAN: Have you been listening to anything inspiring while you’ve been in isolation?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I discovered an artist called Lyra Pramuk. She released a record just at the beginning of lockdown. Also, I’ve been listening a lot to the new Tame Impala. I’m a huge fan of Tame Impala, just as everyone is.</p>
<p>SIVAN: I’m very proud that you said Tame Impala because Kevin Parker’s from Perth, which is where I’m from as well. Something cool about having all of this time on our hands is being able to just dig into stuff that you love, stuff that you’ve been meaning to dig into. To be able to have this feeling of intimate time on your hands is such a new feeling for all of us. There’s something very youthful about it.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: It’s true. Are you in contact with nature a bit?</p>
<p>SIVAN: I’ve been going to this forest that’s 45 minutes away from where my parents live, but you feel like you’re on another planet. It feels like Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Wow.</p>
<p>SIVAN: Once all of this calms down, what’s the first thing you’re going to do?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: Honestly, I just miss doing a gig. I’m an addict. I need the stage, and the possibility of the stage, and sharing songs with faces and human beings. Sometimes I hear discussions in the industry about, “Oh, well, maybe people are not going to come at gigs anymore, and we have to think of another way.” I was like, “What? Another way? I don’t want to do Zoom for the rest of my life. I just want to perform.”</p>
<p>SIVAN: I know in Australia, the plan is you can have gatherings of 100 people in a place in, I think it’s going to be, July. So if you want, you can just come and do a house show for me and my 99 friends that I’m going to have to quickly make.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: If the planes are flying, I’ll hop in.</p>
<p>SIVAN: That’s another thing to consider. You go to get to Australia somehow.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: I’ll swim. I’m leaving now. If I swim fast, I can be in Australia by July.
