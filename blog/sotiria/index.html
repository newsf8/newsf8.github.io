<p>Left: PPE goggles inside a preparation room. Right: A list of medication inside one of the hospital’s two ICU units</p>
<p>My appointment to visit the Sotiria hospital in Athens was on Wednesday 29 April. It took a while for permission from the health ministry to come through and for the Guardian to give the green light. Repeated online meetings with editors covering security assessments, going through best practices and health protocols, checking and rechecking that we had the proper PPE, and that we knew what we were doing. This is all standard procedure before flying for one of my usual assignments in the Middle East, but not something I have ever done for an assignment at home before. Driving towards the hospital, one question kept turning in my head: how do you guard against a threat you can’t see?</p>
<p>A consultant holds the hand of an older patient while a junior doctor checks her pulse</p>
<p>Founded in 1902 as a sanatorium handling tuberculosis cases in Greece, Sotiria is the biggest lung disease centre in the country. The past 10 years have been rough on both the hospital and its staff. A decade of austerity measures has left Greece with a dilapidated healthcare system, and when the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the country on 26 February, everyone braced for the worst. We had all seen the images coming out of Italy.</p>
<p>Medical staff in an ICU unit perform an examination on a patient suffering with respiratory distress</p>
<p>By 23 March, restrictions on all non-essential movement throughout the country were put in place. Shortages in medical equipment and PPE were known from the beginning, forcing hospital staff to be smart on how they allocated their resources, while at the same time trying to increase the number of beds that could accommodate people infected by the virus.</p>
<p>Clockwise from top left: Loukia Mareti, caterer; Georgia Kolofotia, physiotherapist; Yiota Lourida, infectious diseases consultant; Eleni Pagoni, senior nurse</p>
<p>“One month ago I wouldn’t have had the time to speak with you because we were full of patients … We were fighting against a virus that has no known cure and we didn’t know if we would make it through,” said Yiota Lourida, an infectious diseases consultant in one of the Covid-19 clinics of the hospital, as she introduced us to the team of doctors, physiotherapists and support personnel with whom she had spent most of the past two months.</p>
<p>“Some of my colleagues volunteered from other hospitals and others asked for their expired contracts to be extended in order to remain at the hospital and help during these difficult times.”</p>
<p>Medical and catering staff throng the busy corridors of the hospital</p>
<p>We follow her into the ”red zone” of the clinic while she visits patients. After a while I can’t help but notice the eyes of the medical staff, peeking behind their masks while they go about their tasks; tired but full of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Top: a physiotherapist helps a patient perform breathing rehabilitation exercise. Above: a doctor examines an older patient. Right: a doctor inspects medical charts</p>
<p>As we are leaving, I ask Yiota how she thinks Greece managed to flatten the curve. She says: “The real game is played outside the hospitals,” referring to the Greek people, who, in an effort to protect vulnerable groups and the elderly, diligently complied with social distancing and the lockdown.

<h3 id="a-shift-in-sotirias-red-zone">&ldquo;A shift in Sotiria’s ‘red zone’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ekathimerini.com/resources/2020-05/m_l75934-thumb-large.jpg" alt="img">
Athens’ Sotiria Hospital has a clinic dedicated exclusively to Covid-19 patients in a remote corner of the Third Pathology Department’s Center for Respiratory Deficiencies. Located in a lush woodland setting, with broad balconies and lofty ceilings, the center was established at the beginning of the 20th century as a tuberculosis sanatorium. The clinic was set up a few weeks ago following modifications to the building and special training for the 20 doctors and 30 nurses that staff it.</p>
<p>Kathimerini visited the hospital in the northern Athenian suburb of Holargos for a glimpse into what goes on during a shift at the Covid-19 clinic.</p>
<p>“No two days are the same,” says Kostas Syrigos, a professor and director at Sotiria’s Third Pathology Department, which runs the Covid-19 clinic.</p>
<p>Its doctors meet every morning in a ward in the green zone that has been transformed into a lounge where they can keep a safe distance from one another. They talk about the condition of their patients, what happened during the night shift and the results of any tests they have and note down any issues that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>A morning meeting in the green zone, where doctors discuss the condition of their patients.</p>
<p>“A patient may have questioned the results of the test and demanded to be released or retested. The ‘why me’ syndrome and guilt are part and parcel of the process, and this is something we need to manage. It’s a relationship of trust,” says Syrigos.</p>
<p>Pathology professor Giorgos Stergiou is responsible for researching the bibliography and sharing any new findings and information from papers and studies on the coronavirus with his colleagues at the clinic through a digital group they have formed. Covid-19 is a new enemy and there’s a constant stream of new information on how to treat it.</p>
<p>“I had a patient who appeared stable, but his blood gas indicated that he had to intubated,” says resident Yiannis Trontzas. “You may have someone who has no trouble breathing and isn’t gasping coming up much sicker from the tests. We are dealing with something new. It doesn’t give you the signs you know from experience and expertise. It doesn’t present as a typical respiratory disease. It’s tricky.”</p>
<p>Anyone stepping into the red zone is covered head to foot and may have to spend up to four hours in this gear. “The equipment can become very oppressive. It makes you sweat and your goggles fog up. Staff cannot spend much longer in this uniform,” says Garyfallia Poulakou, a pathologist and epidemiologist.

<p>ATHENS, Greece (AP) — More than a century ago, the Sotiria hospital in Athens was built as a public sanatorium for patients with a feared infectious disease that spread through coughing and killed indiscriminately — tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Now Greece’s main hospital for COVID-19 patients, it’s also the focus of a hands-on training program for dozens of medical students who volunteered to relieve hard-pressed doctors from simpler duties while gaining a close peek at the front lines as medical history is being made.</p>
<p>When the Sotiria — which means “salvation” in Greek — was designated to lead the country&rsquo;s coronavirus response in March, medical staff quickly found themselves too busy to properly carry out ordinary duties at a major Athens hospital that treats all kinds of patients. That’s when two doctors and professors of medicine at Athens University thought of seeking help from volunteers.</p>
<p>The program was initially designed for graduates in medicine, but so many students, mostly in their final year, asked to join that it ended up running with them — 56 young men and women from Greek and Slovakian medical schools.</p>
<p>“They underwent rigorous training, and were assigned specific duties and peripheral jobs,” said Garyfallia Poulakou, an assistant professor and contagious disease expert who organized the two-month program together with Kostas Syrigos, a professor of medicine and medical oncology.</p>
<p>“Under no circumstances were they to enter the so-called Red Zone with the COVID-19 patients,” she said. “They proved to be fearless, and the experience for me was very, very positive.”</p>
<p>The students carry out mundane but necessary jobs at the hospital’s pathological clinic, such as attending minor operations, taking blood samples and handling paperwork. In the COVID-19 section, their duties included taking delivery of blood samples in the safe zone and talking to relatives who were not allowed in to see the patients.</p>
<p>Anna Karagiannakou, 21, a third-year student at Safarik University in Kosice, Slovakia, said she has gained vital insights into what being a doctor fully entails.</p>
<p>“Although I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to help treat coronavirus patients, I saw this as an opportunity to provide assistance with other tasks and gain experience at a historic moment in crisis conditions, the like of which I may never encounter again,” she said.</p>

堪培拉Capitol Theatre正式關閉</p>
<p>【大紀元2020年05月23日訊】（大紀元記者黃思文澳洲編譯報導）堪培拉帝苑劇院（Canberra’s Capitol Theatre）自1927年投入使用後，曾一度是居民娛樂的熱門場所。時過境遷，業主上週宣布正式關閉劇院，會找新租戶做其它用途。</p>
<p>1927年12月帝苑劇院在曼努卡區（Manuka）建成開放，座位數量是當時城市人口的五分之一。堪培拉時報曾在頭版報道了劇院首映，稱帝苑氣派且富有藝術氣息和文化氛圍。在電視出現之前，電影是那個時代為數不多的娛樂之一。帝苑劇院很快成為當地居民娛樂和約會的熱門場所。</p>
<p>帝苑劇院從1937年開始放映彩色電影，1938年進行了一次大的改建。在20世紀30至40年代期間，每年上映大約340部電影。到20世紀70年代，劇院運營成本過高難以為繼，影劇院於1980年3月底被拆除重建。</p>
<p>1989年，索提里亞·梁吉斯（Sotiria Liangis）買下了重建的劇院後，他的兒子約翰·梁吉斯（John Liangis）曾負責了幾年的經營。</p>
<p>在宣布正式關閉時，約翰·梁吉斯表示：隨著家庭影院、Netflix或數字放映的發展，原有大型影院的設計已經跟不上潮流，為所有堪培拉人開設一家影院的日子已經一去不復返了。</p>

<h3 id="the-guardians-tribute-to-the-heroic-greek-doctors-at-athens-sotiria-hospital-video">&ldquo;The Guardian’s tribute to the heroic Greek doctors at Athens’ Sotiria Hospital (VIDEO)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/maxresdefault-2.jpg" alt="img">
The Guardian, a British daily newspaper, has paid tribute to the way in which Greece dealt with the coronavirus pandemic, with testimonies from doctors on the frontline at Athens’ Sotiria Hospital explaining how the country did so well.</p>
<p>Dr. Yota Lourida, Infectious Diseases Specialist, explains how her department handled the crisis and the steps taken by the country to mitigate against potentially catastrophic outcomes. “Anyone who came through the hospital doors was considered a potential covid case. We worked non-stop admitting patients and with a high turnover,” she stated.</p>
<p>Stressing that Greece’s healthcare system is “old and decimated” due to the country’s 10-year economic crisis, she said it was a very big question how they would deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>During the complete lockdown, she recalls it was very stressful because the doctors were trying to find the best way to handle cases. “Every day we had to come in and see what we had available, what more we needed to ask for, if it’s available, if it would get here today, tomorrow and so on.”</p>
<p>In addition to the physical fatigue, they also had to deal with the tremendous psychological fatigue. “Trying to make a hole in water,” she said. “I’ve never been called upon to deal with something, for which clearly there is no cure.”</p>
<p>The Guardian also interviewed Dr. Antonia Koutsoukou, Head of ICU, who stated that there were moments of great emotion. What hurt her the most was seeing patients die without saying goodbye to their families. “The fear,” she says, “was becoming like the neighbouring countries.” But according to her, the reason why Greece succeeded was because the healthcare system wasn’t pressurised and didn’t collapse.</p>
<p>“I think throughout this, all of us remembered why we started practicing medicine. Both the young doctors, and the older ones who are actively involved. We couldn’t be anywhere else.”</p>
<p>In closing, Dr. Yota Lourida stated that “I think it’s important to be prepared for a worst case scenario within the hospitals, but the real game is being determined outside of the hospitals.”

<p><img src="https://www.ekathimerini.com/resources/2020-06/nosokomeio-thumb-large-thumb-large.jpg" alt="img">
