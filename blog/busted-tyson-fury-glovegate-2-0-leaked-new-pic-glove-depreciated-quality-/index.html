<p>DESCRIBE WHAT TYSON FURY‚ÄôS GLOVE LOOKS LIKE UNDER THIS POST! #NEWMedia #EGO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like &ldquo;Aww man&hellip;U kno A B&hellip;Absolutely Busted&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The racist trolls and wilder haters can&rsquo;t explain it as expected. All the cover up done by WBC is sickening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet there would be an investigation if wilder caught a body. Hopefully it would be fury. This whole pandemic is shielding  fury and the wbc from scrutiny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thrift store gloves, worn out! You can see them knuckles trough the glove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The glove looks like Tyson fury was mad Deontay said he was ‚Äúpillow fisted‚Äù in the lead up to the fight. Which I feel explains why he immediately said ‚Äúnot bad for pillow fists‚Äù after the fight. That‚Äôs what I see and why we pretending that outcome even fits Tyson fury‚Äôs history? He NEVER did that before, but this is normal? LIES!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person that stopped the fight probably knew exactly what was going on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the center of the glove you can see his pointer,  middle, and ring fingers..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like padding was moved round sometime before he walked out to the ring or sometime during the fight. Bc it&rsquo;s so obvious that something is odd about his gloves. You have to be legally blind to not see the difference between his gloves and wilder&rsquo;s and not jus in this fight but any boxing match who&rsquo;s gloves look like that without being tampered with. &ldquo;Padding was moved round at some point&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No wonder wilder dropped the way he did when he got hit on the first knock down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me and the wife went to target today  so I bought some boxing gloves sparring gloves and regular boxing gloves and I tried to push the glove in how nick Asbury did or how Floyd did maidana gloves ..and I couldn&rsquo;t push that shit in at all with my fingers or fist&hellip;so u have to deliberately remove the padding.. it should not go in that easy like a memory foam bed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like a &ldquo;Rotten Pear&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks lik those old cartoons when they would have a U Shaped Magnet. It looks like he is clinching a U shaped object where the edges protrudes. And by the angle of his forearm it look like hes pushing his punch instead of throwing it. Also that could explain why his thumb is detached so he can get a better grip on his Irish Brass Knuckles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE SMOKING GUN!!! GOOD FIND EGO!!üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looked like 2 dents clear as day. He took the padding out and put something else in his glove. Needs to be banned from boxing for life!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOOK AT HIS FACE CLOSELY ON THE FURY DEBUNK VIDEO&hellip;YOU CAN SEE HIS EXPESSION SHOWING HE‚ÄôS LYING, BAD POKER FACE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S/O Ego üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üíØ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great work .Stay on their head bro!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying real hard to cover this up. Throwing money around everywhere. That photographer must be laughing to the bank bc they paid him off and they still can&rsquo;t cover it up. Can&rsquo;t wait until Wilder&rsquo;s evidence comes out. Boy will it be a hefty lawsuit.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks to me it‚Äôs something in the glove also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wowwwww this is crazy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ego I‚Äôm not the smartest but what if  when fury threw the towel over the camera or unplugged it ( which ever happened) they switched gloves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never seen no gloves lookin like that before. Could have an object in replace of the padding as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about the way the WBC has treated him he should concentrate on the other rankings and fight a rivas chisora or usyk and take that route</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro you know they not going to bring the real gloves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like a flat iron figure 8 belt buckle solid indention etc in the glove  smh..attempted murder. Fury is a cheat and needs to be stripped and banned from boxing..PERIOD! Those who are in a position to ban Fury and don&rsquo;t even bat an eye are just as guilty as Fury and his team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like glove is being prevented to not sink down by something after all those punches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like wilder and his team know more than there leading on his bro said something bout ppl on your own team will do anything&hellip;ü§î that‚Äôs suspect to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pure hatred on our greatness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A complete different story based on nature of the events but from Wilder&rsquo;s injuries! It reminds me of Cotto&rsquo;s face wjen it was completely damaged against Margarito rumors and shit like pics,videos,etc of Margarito&rsquo;s handwrap aarted to come up  .. and just from Cotto&rsquo;s injuries shit wasn&rsquo;t or normal BUT!! Def i do remember of Margarito getting caught later down the road b4 facing Mosley.Point,extremely dirty also dangerous.. it could kill Cotto somehow I rem Cotto managed going on kneeling cpl of time late in rounds  to protect himself until tge towel came uo.. Ego,good looking on pointing out/describe how early it was during  Wilder&quot;s fight.. ear wasn&rsquo;t  busted yet.. but true AMAZING pics without that just a he say.. he say</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is the PBC on all this. Why haven‚Äôt they come forward. At the end of the day nothing will come of this because to much money to be made on the their third fight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like he took most of all the padding from the top of the glove and that‚Äôs his knuckles showing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There most likely something in there, definitely some tempering . Honestly, nothing will happen to furry due to the amount of money involved. Fight three just got interesting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just wondering if you are having any concerns about gloves, why are you not directing your concerns to Jay Deas and the Nevada state officials as it was DEAS whom witnessed the gloving procedure and signed off on it  ?  Or since he is white you think he might have been in on it, that is how you lot think i notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ego you should see Teddy Atlas video talking about glove gate 2.0. He&rsquo;s basically saying there&rsquo;s no way Fury or his team could have tampered with the gloves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor performed an autopsy on Wilder&rsquo;d body to determine the cause of the dent? Is his skull made of metal? A caved in skull means the bones are broken, face swollen immediately, blood or internal bleeding and career ending injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They trying to change the narrative as to what the issue is. They are mistaking wilder brother saying no glove or fist cam cause the dent BUT cast like hand wrap CAN cause that which would be due to the skinned looking gloves. So Deas could have been there but if you started massaging the gloves once they&rsquo;re on then that would cause the gloves to look the way they do so anybody could have watched the wrapping not saying there was plaster there or anything but those flimsy looking a** gloves  is the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is horrible. I don&rsquo;t want to hear a single word from any of you deontay Wilder haters unless you can explain why all of these photos even exist. Don&rsquo;t give me that photoshop nonsense either because that argument has been chopped up. if you can&rsquo;t explain it then don&rsquo;t talk because everything else is just noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fury represents the great hope for the White Supremacist society to attain the &ldquo;highest&rdquo; sports title in the world so they need to assist and protect him.  He represents the over-the-top &ldquo;White Pride&rdquo; hero that they are seeking nowadays (a tone set by the outrageous President Trump).  Although the Klitschko brothers were also white (and great champions), they were very considered &ldquo;too&rdquo; reserved and humble to serve the intended purpose of pushing the &lsquo;white supremacist&rsquo; ideology.  The Klitschko brothers were also champions during a period when Obama was the &ldquo;world leader&rdquo;. NOTE: This is why, although a U.S. Olympian, Wilder shamefully had absolutely no support in his home country, and actually the crowd in Las Vegas was hostile toward him (see the situations with Mayweather vs. Pacman/McGreggor).
