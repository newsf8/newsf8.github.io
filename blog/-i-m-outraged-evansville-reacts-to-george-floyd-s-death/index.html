<p>CLOSE The FBI is investigating the death of George Floyd after he was restrained by police in Minneapolis. Storyful</p>
<p>EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Brooklynn Bonham stood at the corner of U.S. 41 and Covert Avenue Wednesday holding a sign that read, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Floyd said those three words as he struggled for air, a Minneapolis Police officer kneeling on his neck. The incident was caught on tape, and the video turned viral.</p>
<p>Floyd later died, and that officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired along with three others who witnessed the incident.</p>
<p>But his death — only the latest case of a black man dying after an encounter with police that&rsquo;s garnered media attention — has led to a national furor, sweeping up Evansville residents along with it.</p>
<p>Related: George Floyd remembered as &lsquo;gentle giant&rsquo; as family calls his death &lsquo;murder&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bonham, the highway protester, saw the video and knew she had to do something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see this thing going around social media, and making a post or anything like that just wouldn&rsquo;t be enough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even though it&rsquo;s just a poster board, I feel like I&rsquo;m doing something slightly more important because I&rsquo;m outraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bonham said drivers honked as they drove by, with some people flashing peace signs or raising their fists in solidarity.</p>
<p>It was also a teaching moment, as Bonham explained the circumstances surrounding Floyd&rsquo;s death to pedestrians who hadn&rsquo;t heard what happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was really just to make a statement, to let people here know that this stuff is really going on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that this is our reality, and even though it may not be affecting everyone here in Evansville, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t affect us anytime in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rev. Gerald Arnold, president of the NAACP Evansville Branch, released a statement condemning Chauvin&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears that the pandemic quarantine gave racist people the opportunity to gather themselves because we are witnessing murders and beatings by police, incidents of white people calling the police on African Americans,&rdquo; Arnold&rsquo;s statement read in part.</p>

<p>An unknown person or group hung anti-police banners off a Jimtown railway bridge Wednesday amid heightened awareness of police brutality sparked by Floyd&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The now infamous video has also prompted an anti-violence rally, planned for Saturday in Downtown Evansville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It kind of struck me, seeing the video and seeing the man cry out,&rdquo; organizer Ebon Ellis said. &ldquo;Seeing the bystanders who were recording it trying to tell the officer to get off his neck and just seeing him pass out in the middle of the street even though he wasn&rsquo;t resisting, that one really struck a nerve with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Related: George Floyd video adds to trauma: &lsquo;When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ellis said that while Floyd&rsquo;s death led him to act, the problem of deadly violence against black men — whether or not at the hands of the police — is much larger and happens here, too.</p>
<p>He said he didn&rsquo;t want the news out of Minneapolis to overshadow the killing of Larry Meriweather Jr., a 30-year-old man who was fatally shot at a house party in Evansville in the early morning hours Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want the violence to stop,&rdquo; Ellis said. &ldquo;To me, it&rsquo;s accountability. I want everybody, whether you wear a uniform or not, to be held accountable for your actions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hopes the rally, dubbed &ldquo;We All Bleed Red,&rdquo; will encourage attendees to recognize their shared humanity. It will include prayer and the testimonies of people affected by violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter where we come from, whatever skin color, your neighbor is your neighbor,&rdquo; Ellis said. &ldquo;I want us all to just realize that we all are part of the same human race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Base us off of our actions. Not our skin color,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Organizers are encouraging attendees to wear masks and said social distancing guidelines will be followed. Ellis stressed the protest will be peaceful and said EPD officers will be patrolling the area.</p>
<p>The rally starts at noon at the Four Freedoms Monument and will last until 2 p.m.</p>

The Minneapolis police officer shown on video kneeling on George Floyd’s neck as Floyd pleaded for help, along with another officer who stood by and watched, have both been involved in use-of-force incidents over their careers.</p>
<p>Officer Derek Chauvin has been identified as the officer pinning down Floyd in the now-viral video, which shows Floyd saying he can’t breathe repeatedly before losing consciousness. Floyd later died. Four officers on scene have been fired. They have not yet been officially identified by department officials.</p>
<p>Chauvin, 44, is a 19-year department veteran. Department records and news accounts show that he has been involved in several police-involved shootings over his career.</p>
<p>In 2008, Chauvin shot and wounded a man named Ira Latrelle Toles during a domestic assault call. According to a 2011 article from the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Chauvin and other officers showed up to an apartment in south Minneapolis just before 2 a.m. Toles grabbed for an officer’s gun and Chauvin shot him in the abdomen.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In 2006, Chauvin and five others responded to a stabbing. After a man named Wayne Reyes, 42, allegedly pulled a shotgun on the officers, one of the officers shot and killed Reyes, according to a report titled “Stolen Lives” from Communities United Against Police Brutality, a police watchdog nonprofit based in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The other officer identified in the video is Tou Thao. According to a deposition he gave in a 2017 lawsuit, Thao started with the department as a community service officer. He went through the academy in 2009. He was laid off for two years and returned to the department in 2012.</p>
<p>In 2017, a man named Lamar Ferguson sued Thao and another officer, Robert Thunder, for excessive use of force. According to the lawsuit, Ferguson and an eight-month-pregnant woman were walking home when Thao and Thunder stopped and searched them without cause. The officers handcuffed Ferguson, and Thao threw him to the ground and began punching him, while Thunder kicked him, according to the allegations.</p>
<p>The officers took Ferguson to the hospital for medical treatment. Afterward, they escorted Ferguson to jail wearing only his underwear and T-shirt, rejecting hospital staff’s requests that he be allowed to fully dress, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In a deposition, Thao said they arrested Ferguson due to an outstanding warrant for his arrest. He said he only punched Ferguson after one of Ferguson’s hands slipped out of the handcuffs.</p>
<p>“He tries to pull away,” Thao said in the deposition. “And he puts his hands on me and tries to give me a stiff arm in a way to try to get me off of him. &hellip; At this point he’s actively resisting arrest. &hellip; So I had no choice but to punch him. I punched him in the face. It causes him to pause a bit, which gives Officer Thunder the time to come around and help.”</p>
<p>The case settled out of court for $25,000, according to Seth Leventhal, one of Ferguson’s attorneys.

<h3 id="trump-was-very-upset-after-watching-george-floyd-video-mcenany-says">&ldquo;Trump was ‘very upset’ after watching George Floyd video, McEnany says&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/cbe982a4-4b3c-4a1c-a766-8aab181f17ed/dbef1603-ac76-41e0-8a43-4b3961437979/1280x720/match/image.jpg" alt="img">
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday that President Trump was “very upset” when he saw the George Floyd video in Minnesota.</p>
<p>It was “egregious, appalling and tragic,” McEnany continued. “He wants justice to be served.” She said that the video prompted Trump to “pick up the phone” while aboard Air Force One and ask the FBI to expedite its investigation.</p>
<p>The press secretary added that at the time of her briefing the president was being briefed on the situation by Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray.</p>
<p>Floyd, 46, was pronounced dead Monday night after he was pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.</p>
<p>Chauvin, along with three other police officers involved in the incident, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, were fired from the force Tuesday, hours after a bystander’s video showed Chauvin kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving.</p>
<p>GEORGE FLOYD CASE: TWO MINNEAPOLIS COPS CAUGHT ON TAPE HAVE HISTORY OF CONDUCT COMPLAINTS</p>
<p>Trump announced Wednesday night that he had ordered the FBI and the DOJ to investigate the killing, calling it a “very sad and tragic death.”</p>
<p>Both the FBI and state law enforcement authorities are currently investigating the case. It immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York City after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.</p>
<p>The Floyd video, which sparked outrage after it was posted online, starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.</p>
<p>Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” The man calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts &hellip; I can&rsquo;t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He&rsquo;s talking, so he&rsquo;s breathing.”</p>
<p>GEORGE FLOYD CASE: MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF SAYS CITY&rsquo;S &lsquo;DEFICIT OF HOPE&rsquo; CANNOT BE COMPOUNDED WITH MORE TRAUMA, VIOLENCE</p>
<p>But Floyd stops talking and slowly becomes motionless under the officer&rsquo;s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.</p>
<p>As lawmakers, celebrities and athletes alike demanded justice, protests erupted across the state of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo acknowledged his department contributed to a so-called “deficit of hope” but said that he could not allow others to compound that trauma with looting, robbing and torching buildings in the name of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>“I know that there is currently a deficit of hope in this city and I know as I wear this uniform before you, this department has contributed to that deficit of hope, but I will not allow to continue to increase that deficit by re-traumatizing those folks in our community.”</p>
<p>Minneapolis has faced two nights of violent protests which even turned deadly — at least five people were struck by gunfire from Wednesday night into early Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday demanded the arrest of the police officer who had his knee on Floyd’s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?&rdquo; Frey asked during a news conference. &ldquo;If you had done it, or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fox News&rsquo; Andrew O&rsquo;Reilly, Barnini Chakraborti and Lucia Suarez contributed to this report.

<p><img src="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/v8jursugptlpin5qstcn/george-floyd-protests" alt="img">
The teenager who filmed George Floyd while a police officer kneeled on his neck as he was arrested has shared that she is traumatized by online abuse she&rsquo;s received. 17-year-old Darnella Frazier shared the original clip, as TMZ reports, and since it made its way online she has received criticism for not intervening as Floyd told officers he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect anyone who wasn&rsquo;t placed in my position to understand why and how I feel the way that I do,&rdquo; Frazier wrote on Facebook. &ldquo;I am a minor! 17 years old, of course I&rsquo;m not about to fight off a cop I&rsquo;m SCARED wtf. I don&rsquo;t give 2 fucks about what y&rsquo;all would&rsquo;ve did because was y&rsquo;all there?? NO. Fighting would&rsquo;ve got someone else killed or in the same position George (may he rest in peace) was in. If it wasn&rsquo;t for me 4 cops would&rsquo;ve still had their jobs, causing other problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Frazier told TMZ, some people have accused her of sharing the video for &ldquo;clout&rdquo; or attention. She refuted this while also making it clear that she didn&rsquo;t exactly feel safe inserting herself into the situation as a 17-year-old black girl. The reactions she&rsquo;s received online have obviously had an impact on her, as did witnessing Floyd plead for his life with the cops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My video went world wide for everyone to see and know! His family was reached out to! The police most definitely would&rsquo;ve swept it under the rug with a cover up story,&rdquo; Darnella continued. &ldquo;Instead of bashing me, THANK ME! Because that could&rsquo;ve been one of your loved ones and you would want to see the truth as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darnella Frazier was out to get something from a store when she witnessed the situation, her mother added.</p>
<p>In an interview with NowThis, Frazier said she&rsquo;s been overwhelmed since she witnessed Floyd&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;I watched this man die. I was the one that was recording the whole thing. I&rsquo;ve seen him die,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I posted the video last night, and it just went viral. And everybody&rsquo;s asking me how do I feel? I don&rsquo;t know how to feel. &hellip; It&rsquo;s so sad, bro. This man was literally right here, 8 p.m. yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="trump-tries-a-new-response-after-george-floyds-death">&ldquo;Trump tries a new response after George Floyd&rsquo;s death&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1578508940" alt="img">
WASHINGTON — It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel very, very badly,&rdquo; Trump said Thursday of George Floyd&rsquo;s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very shocking sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more likely to hew to the &ldquo;blue lives matter&rdquo; mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer&rsquo;s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first race-tinged case that I&rsquo;ve ever heard him address&rdquo; as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. &ldquo;So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it&rsquo;s empty words because it is so out of character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President&rsquo;s unwavering support for the African-American community,&rdquo; Deere said, citing Trump&rsquo;s support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something that is a local matter and that&rsquo;s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,&rdquo; then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time.</p>
<p>He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner&rsquo;s dying words, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe,&rdquo; became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: &ldquo;You have people on both sides of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars.</p>
<p>But Trump&rsquo;s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,&rdquo; he told reporters this month. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a heartbreaking thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: &ldquo;it could be something that we didn&rsquo;t see on tape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn&rsquo;t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving.</p>
<p>Trump &ldquo;was very upset when he saw that video,&rdquo; White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. &ldquo;He wants justice to be served.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s conservative allies also rallied to the cause.</p>
<p>Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is &ldquo;a big supporter of law enforcement,&rdquo; but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: &ldquo;The lack of training here is breathtaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,&rdquo; echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,&rdquo; said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.</p>
<p>Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a &ldquo;terrorist group,&rdquo; said Thursday that Floyd&rsquo;s death was totally &ldquo;unjustified&rdquo; and he was &ldquo;so mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t black,&rdquo; a gaffe he later said he regretted.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation&rsquo;s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination.</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden.</p>
<p>Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans&rsquo; response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it&rsquo;s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd&rsquo;s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a father that misses a kid&rsquo;s graduation of high school, graduation of college,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he&rsquo;s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJ2EM2FBP4I6VPQGV5KRJ3QDQU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
MINNEAPOLIS — An evening that started with peaceful protests descended into disarray and looting as the night wore on. A group of officers stood in front of a nearby precinct and tried to disrupt the crowd with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. At times, the tear gas was so thick, it wafted down neighborhood streets where people standing in their front yards were coughing and wiping at their eyes.</p>
<p>By 10 p.m., an Auto Zone had caught fire. Soon, other fires erupted, including a massive blaze at a construction site. Meanwhile, one person was shot by a pawn shop owner and died at a hospital, police told the Star Tribune, as looters ransacked a Target, Foot Locker and nearby small businesses.</p>
<p>The chaos that followed Wednesday’s demonstrations prompted state and local officials to plea for peace</p>
<p>“Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” Mayor Jacob Frey (D) said in a late-night statement. The mayor requested help from the state’s National Guard amid a second night of disruption.</p>
<p>His calls for calm echoed those of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), whose district covers some of the affected area.</p>
<p>“Violence only begets violence,&rdquo; she tweeted, urging peaceful protest. &ldquo;More force is only going to lead to more lives lost and more devastation.”</p>
<p>Police Chief Medaria Arradondo told local media the majority of the protesters remained peaceful, but told Minnesota Public Radio later that night that the display had been “hijacked” by some protesters and those looting and vandalizing businesses.</p>
<p>After police faced stinging criticism for heavy-handed tactics deployed during the first night of protests, critics like City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison were among those who expressed disappointment at the department’s failure to maintain public safety late Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always do this — we create a barrier, put the police out there, put them in a line, put face masks, depersonalize them, make them look as scary as possible and we always get this result, and then we want to point the finger at community members,” Ellison told MPR Thursday.</p>
<p>The chaotic scenes followed the death of 46-year-old George Floyd on Monday, which came after a white officer pinned the handcuffed father of two to the pavement outside of a market where employees had called police about a counterfeit bill. The police encounter was caught on a viral video that has sparked national outrage and inflamed existing tensions in a community where officers have long been accused of racism.</p>
<p>In the suburb of Oakdale, hundreds of protesters on Wednesday gathered outside the home of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who was captured on the video with his knee on Floyd’s neck. According to the Star Tribune, red paint was poured onto Chauvin’s driveway, and the word “killer” was written on the garage door.</p>
<p>Police Chief Medaria Arradondo swiftly fired Chauvin after Floyd’s death, along with the three other involved officers, identified by authorities Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. President Trump on Wednesday tweeted that he had asked the FBI, which is investigating the death, to expedite its work, adding that “Justice will be served!”
