<p>Spoiler alert! This story contains details from the June 2 episode of &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going for gold. New &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent&rdquo; judge Sofía Vergara hit her first Golden Buzzer on Tuesday&rsquo;s show for a young singer with a powerful voice beyond her years. The buzzer sends the act straight to the live final shows.</p>
<p>Despite her nerves, Roberta Battaglia was determined: &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m just dreaming, but it&rsquo;s actually real life, and I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said before taking the stage. &ldquo;I might only be 10 years old, but I have big dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On stage, she was starstruck by Vergara: &ldquo;Oh, my gosh! Let me just say, I love you, and I watch you on &lsquo;Modern Family,'&rdquo; said the contestant, who&rsquo;s from Toronto. &ldquo;I just adore you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Struggling to overcome her nerves, Battaglia accepted judge Simon Cowell&rsquo;s offer of water, handed to her by host Terry Crews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a 10-year-old,&rdquo; said judge Heidi Klum, referring to her daughter, Lou Sulola Samuel, with ex-husband Seal. &ldquo;She would never get on that stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;America’s Got Talent&rsquo;: Singer Archie Williams gets second chance after wrongful conviction</p>
<p>Gabrielle Union felt &lsquo;isolated&rsquo; after ‘AGT&rsquo; departure; NBC, producers say probe clears show</p>
<p>Once Battaglia started &ldquo;Shallow,&rdquo; the Oscar-winning tune from the 2018 remake of &ldquo;A Star is Born,&rdquo; her butterflies began to subside. After just a few notes, soft cheers came from the audience. By the time she belted out the chorus, the audience rose to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a mature voice,&rdquo; Vergara commented.</p>
<p>After her performance, Battaglia broke down in tears. Cowell gave the singer two thumbs up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing what you just did!&rdquo; Klum remarked. Judge Howie Mandel described the child&rsquo;s talent as &ldquo;unbelievable.&rdquo; Cowell called her &ldquo;so likable, so humble,&rdquo; guessing she had &ldquo;great friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Battaglia revealed she&rsquo;s faced some opposition: &ldquo;Sometimes I do get bullied.&rdquo; .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullies are always threatened (by) talented people,&rdquo; Cowell told her. &ldquo;So in a weird way, it&rsquo;s a compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TV&rsquo;s biggest cliffhanger:Will my show return on schedule?</p>
<p>Summer 2020 TV premieres: Here&rsquo;s when your favorite show returns, your new addiction starts</p>
<p>Vergara was direct in her praise: &ldquo;It was amazing! It was breathtaking!&hellip; That&rsquo;s impossible to sing like that at 10 years old, and you know what, let&rsquo;s see who is going to bully you after this,&rdquo; she said, hitting the buzzer.</p>
<p>As confetti showered Battaglia, she covered her face with her hands, overcome with emotion. Vergara left the judges' table and greeted her on stage.</p>
<p>The two embraced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were so amazing!&rdquo; Vergara told her. &ldquo;You were so good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Golden Buzzer follows one Crews doled out on the season premiere to the Voices of Our City Choir from San Diego, including some members who are homeless.</p>
<p>Sofia Vergara joins &lsquo;America’s Got Talent&rsquo; as a new judge for Season 15</p>

This season of AGT introduces us to Roberta Battaglia, a 10-year-old singer from Canada with a voice beyond her years. Prepare to be blown away by her talent and poise.</p>
<p>Read on to find out more about this talented youngster, including how long she’s been singing and where she draws her inspiration from. We can’t wait to see how far she goes on AGT Season 15.</p>
<p>5 Facts About ‘AGT’s Roberta Battaglia</p>
<p>Roberta’s parents are Italian.</p>
<p>Roberta was born in 2009 to Italian parents, making her 10 years old now. She lives in Toronto, Canada, and is fluent in both English and Italian. Her father, Alessandro, is also a singer. He moved to Canada from Italy in 2008. Alessandro inspired his daughter to sing, as her mom says she would pick up his microphones from a young age.</p>
<p>RELATED: WHY ‘AGT’ WILL STILL BE ON IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC</p>
<p>She’s been singing with her dad for years.</p>
<p>Roberta started singing when she was three years old, and has performed locally with her father. “It’s because of him that I’m where I am and doing what I do,” Roberta has said of her father’s influence. Check out one of their first duets together above, in which they perform “Mi scappa la pipì.”</p>
<p>Her cover of ‘Shallow’ went viral.</p>
<p>Last year, Roberta appeared on Canadian morning show Breakfast Television, which happens to be her favorite television show. She performed “Shallow” from A Star Is Born. The hosts were blown away by the performance, with one of them saying it’s the “best version” he’s ever heard of it. The video racked up over 600,000 views. Interestingly, one commenter suggested she should audition for AGT!</p>
<p>Roberta has raised money for charity.</p>
<p>Roberta does more than just sing. She has also made and sold bracelets to raise money for the charity SickKids. In the video above, she shows off her creations on the news. She said it was something she already knew how to do, and decided it would be a “creative” way to raise money.</p>

<p>“I really like to encourage people, especially kids my age,” Roberta has said. “Whatever dream they have they can achieve it; never stop dreaming, never stop believing in yourself.”</p>
<p>Her dream is to sing with P!nk.</p>
<p>Roberta’s favorite genres of music are R&amp;B and jazz, and she names Etta James and Aretha Franklin as some of her favorite artists. When asked in an interview which current artist she would want to perform with, Roberta said P!nk.</p>
<p>“I just love her songs and the notes that she can reach,” Roberta explained. “Oh my goodness, she is so humble.” She said she’s watched her on television and listened to her CDs. Maybe AGT can make this dream duet happen!

Following George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last Monday, people around the U.S. have taken to the streets to protest yet another act of police brutality against a black American. And, as is often the case when glaring acts of injustice and racism take place, many NBA and WNBA players took to social media to speak out about police violence against black Americans, and some even attended or led protests.</p>
<p>On Monday morning’s episode of Get Up, forward for the LA Sparks and WNBPA vice president Chiney Ogwumike spoke fervently about why athletes should use their platforms for social change and she praised her fellow basketball stars for speaking up.</p>
<p>“Seeing all the images of athletes has been tremendously inspiring, and I think the reason why you see athletes leading the charge when it comes to social change is because at the root of it all, it’s in our DNA,” Ogwumike said. “We are team players; we are wired to care for the last player on the bench as much as we care about ourselves. We’ve been athletes almost our entire lives. We cannot turn this on or off.”</p>
<p>The NBA and WNBA are widely viewed as two of the most progressive American sports leagues and they are also comprised mostly of black athletes and athletes of color, making this issue one that so many players have personally been affected by. Back in 2014, NBA players wore black t-shirts with the words, “I Can’t Breathe,” printed on them to protest Eric Garner’s death at the hands of an NYPD officer. In 2016, following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, four players on the Minnesota Lynx held a pre-game press conference to address police violence. In the days that followed, players from the New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury and Indiana Fever all wore black t-shirts during warmups. Maya Moore, one of the Lynx players who organized the press conference and one of the greatest to ever play in the WNBA, took the unprecedented decision to sit out the 2019 and 2020 WNBA seasons to fight for criminal justice reform.</p>
<p>Last week’s events saw many players go out and protest right alongside people for an end to police violence, an end to racism and a recognition from those in power that black lives matter. Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown drove from Boston to Atlanta on Saturday to lead a peaceful protest where Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon joined him and delivered an impassioned message to the crowd. Several other Celtics players including Marcus Smart, Vincent Poirier, and Enes Kanter, who has faced threats from his own government in Turkey, attended Sunday’s protests in Boston. Former NBA champion Stephen Jackson led a press conference on Friday commemorating Floyd’s death with Karl-Anthony Towns, who recently lost his mother to COVID-19, Josh Okogie, Gary Trent Jr. and Royce White in attendance.</p>
<p>“This is why you see Jaylen Brown driving 15 hours to lead a peaceful protest in his hometown,” Ogwumike said. “This is why you see Maya Moore forgoing WNBA season in her prime in order to fight for the wrongfully convicted. This is why you see Karl-Anthony Towns, star of the Minnesota Timberwolves, still show strength in the midst of his grief after losing his mom due to the pandemic.”</p>
<p>On Monday, Ogwumike went on to talk about how black athletes can reach the highest pinnacles of success in their respective sports, but still be reduced to nothing based on the color of their skin. In April 2015, NYPD officers broke then-Milwaukee Bucks player Thabo Sefalosha’s leg while arresting him outside a Chelsea nightclub. However, Ogwumike also acknowledged the privileges that athletes of color do have compared to other people in the U.S. who may not have the same level of financial security, power or fame.</p>
<p>“I guess, overall as athletes, I’ve been really proud to see them stand up and speak up because ⁠— I mean we all know this ⁠— we’re not comfortable staying on the sidelines in the middle of a battle, in the middle of a struggle, when it’s crunch time,” she said. “So, we want to be in the game, we want to win and more importantly, share that feeling. That is what moves us. That is our standard and it’s bigger than sports.”

Following George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last Monday, people around the U.S. have taken to the streets to protest yet another act of police brutality against a black American. And, as is often the case when glaring acts of injustice and racism take place, many NBA and WNBA players took to social media to speak out about police violence against black Americans, and some even attended or led protests.</p>
<p>On Monday morning’s episode of Get Up, forward for the LA Sparks and WNBPA vice president Chiney Ogwumike spoke fervently about why athletes should use their platforms for social change and she praised her fellow basketball stars for speaking up.</p>
<p>“Seeing all the images of athletes has been tremendously inspiring, and I think the reason why you see athletes leading the charge when it comes to social change is because at the root of it all, it’s in our DNA,” Ogwumike said. “We are team players; we are wired to care for the last player on the bench as much as we care about ourselves. We’ve been athletes almost our entire lives. We cannot turn this on or off.”</p>
<p>The NBA and WNBA are widely viewed as two of the most progressive American sports leagues and they are also comprised mostly of black athletes and athletes of color, making this issue one that so many players have personally been affected by. Back in 2014, NBA players wore black t-shirts with the words, “I Can’t Breathe,” printed on them to protest Eric Garner’s death at the hands of an NYPD officer. In 2016, following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, four players on the Minnesota Lynx held a pre-game press conference to address police violence. In the days that followed, players from the New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury and Indiana Fever all wore black t-shirts during warmups. Maya Moore, one of the Lynx players who organized the press conference and one of the greatest to ever play in the WNBA, took the unprecedented decision to sit out the 2019 and 2020 WNBA seasons to fight for criminal justice reform.</p>
<p>Last week’s events saw many players go out and protest right alongside people for an end to police violence, an end to racism and a recognition from those in power that black lives matter. Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown drove from Boston to Atlanta on Saturday to lead a peaceful protest where Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon joined him and delivered an impassioned message to the crowd. Several other Celtics players including Marcus Smart, Vincent Poirier, and Enes Kanter, who has faced threats from his own government in Turkey, attended Sunday’s protests in Boston. Former NBA champion Stephen Jackson led a press conference on Friday commemorating Floyd’s death with Karl-Anthony Towns, who recently lost his mother to COVID-19, Josh Okogie, Gary Trent Jr. and Royce White in attendance.</p>
<p>“This is why you see Jaylen Brown driving 15 hours to lead a peaceful protest in his hometown,” Ogwumike said. “This is why you see Maya Moore forgoing WNBA season in her prime in order to fight for the wrongfully convicted. This is why you see Karl-Anthony Towns, star of the Minnesota Timberwolves, still show strength in the midst of his grief after losing his mom due to the pandemic.”</p>

<h3 id="who-got-the-golden-buzzer-heres-every-agt-golden-buzzer-pick-for-season-15">&ldquo;Who Got the Golden Buzzer? Here&rsquo;s Every AGT Golden Buzzer Pick for Season 15&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NUP_190480_10435.jpg" alt="img">
America’s Got Talent Season 15 is underway, and luckily, the NBC talent competition was able to film a portion of the show before having to go remote for the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning it was business as usual the first two nights, including the selection of a Golden Buzzer each night.</p>
<p>The Golden Buzzer is one of the most dramatic moments of the audition process and happens when one of the judges–Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum and Sofia Vergara–or host Terry Crews are so moved by one of the acts that they award the honor. Each only gets to hit the Golden Buzzer one time, so they take great care in their decision-making.</p>
<p>Winning a Golden Buzzer is a big deal for the talent because it ensures that they go directly to the Live Shows, and don’t have to compete in the playoff process, putting them that much closer to the $1 million grand prize.</p>
<p>Here are the AGT Golden Buzzer picks for Season 15 so far. Keep checking back for updates.</p>

<p>Voices of Our City Choir, a 225-member choir, formed of those who have experienced being unsheltered and homeless from San Diego, Calif. The choir performed an original song that their members wrote called “Sounds of the Street.”</p>

<p>Crew commented, “It is time to make something happen right now for everybody on this stage. What they did today moved me to this point right there,” and, so saying, he hit the Golden Buzzer.</p>
<p>Ten-year-old singer Roberta Battaglia from Toronto, Canada, who auditioned singing “Shallow” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper from A Star is Born.</p>
<p>“It was amazing!,” Vergara told her first-ever Golden Buzzer. “It was breathtaking! It’s impossible to sing like that at 10 years old.”</p>
<p>America’s Got Talent airs Tuesday nights at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.</p>
