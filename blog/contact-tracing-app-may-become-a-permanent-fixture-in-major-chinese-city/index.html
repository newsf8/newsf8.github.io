<p>One of China&rsquo;s major tech hubs is planning to make a health and movement tracking system developed to fight the COVID-19 epidemic a permanent fixture in daily life.</p>
<p>Officials in the city of Hangzhou, home to Alibaba and other Chinese tech concernts, said on Friday (Chinese language) the local government wishes to create creating a permanent version the country&rsquo;s tracing app that was designed to help lift the country out of lockdown. The proposed system would be a &ldquo;&lsquo;firewall&rsquo; to enhance people&rsquo;s health and immunity&rdquo; after the pandemic, the city&rsquo;s health commission said.</p>
<p>The app, which is mandatory, gives users green, yellow, or red status based on their travel history and whether they have been in contact with known cases.</p>
<p>Residents who recently traveled to a virus hot spot, for instance, would be given a red code and be asked to quarantine for 14 days. Those who were feeling healthy and had no contact with confirmed cases are given a green code and are allowed to move freely around the city.</p>
<p>The app covers one billion people and the codes it generates have been scanned more than nine billion times, according to Tencent, which co-developed the app with Alibaba.</p>
<p>The proposal put forward by Hangzhou&rsquo;s Health Commission would assign users a health score ranging from 0 to 100 based on their medical records, physical examinations, as well as lifestyle factors, such as how many cigarettes they smoke, steps they walk, or hours they sleep daily.</p>
<p>The new system adds another layer to China&rsquo;s extensive programme for monitoring its citizens. Facial recognition technology has become standard in many cities and has been used to catch criminals in large crowds and automatically fine jaywalkers. The country&rsquo;s social credit system monitors citizen&rsquo;s online behaviour, such as social media posts and online shopping, to determine a &ldquo;citizen score&rdquo; that is used to reward and punish.</p>
<p>The new proposal would give authorities access to much more personal data, leading some critics to draw comparisons to Black Mirror. Hangzhou&rsquo;s Health Commission did not explain how it would obtain such data or whether it would need users&rsquo; consent to access it.</p>
<p>Data protection has been a long-time issue in China, with officials attempting to craft an overarching law to protect personal information for well over a decade. Last week at the country&rsquo;s annual National People&rsquo;s Congress, Standing Committee chair Li Zhanshu said the government would push forward with a such a law as part of an attempt to improve &ldquo;national security and social governance.&rdquo; Â®</p>

<p>Tottenhamâs hosting of Manchester United is set to be the first match when the Premier League returns in June.</p>
<p>Leicester City and their Premier League rivals are expected to approve the protocols for phase two of return to training, which would allow for a maximum group size of 12 - but crucially would not be full contact sessions, which follow in phase three.</p>
<p>However, there is optimism that the road ahead is starting to become clear and it has been reported that dates for the return of the Premier League could be decided this week - likely to be either June 19 or June 26.</p>
<p>It is reported that the plan is for staggered kick-off times on Saturday and Sunday, with four matches on each day, followed by Monday Night Football - and every game is set to be available for UK audiences.</p>

<p>Sky Sports would show four matches and BT Sport would have one slot, with the other five matches set to be available with free-to-air access - potentially on YouTube or via the red button.</p>
<p>It has previously been suggested that matches could take place daily but itâs now reported that the Premier League is keen on a routine for weekend matches - although midweek games are still likely to be required to fit in all the remaining fixtures.</p>
<p>ESPN reports that the first game upon the leagueâs return will be Manchester Unitedâs trip to face Tottenham, where they will face off against former manager Jose Mourinho in what is a crucial battle for Champions League football.</p>
<p>Full dates and details are yet to be confirmed and there will are important discussions lying ahead in the coming days and weeks, so the situation could be subject to change at short notice.

<p>AFL adopting flexible approach</p>
<p>Unlike the NRL, which has released the full draw for the revamped 2020 season, the AFL has named only a first block of four rounds â in order to allow for changes in coronavirus restrictions later in the year.</p>

<p>The AFL&rsquo;s Travis Auld said it was expected the draw for the next block of games, rounds six and seven, would be released after round three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To re-launch the season, we have focused on scheduling blockbuster match-ups across these four weeks, particularly in the Thursday and Friday-night primetime slots,&rdquo; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we navigate through the remaining 108 games, plus finals, we will continue to be adaptable with our scheduling, ensuring our fixtures align with the relevant state government restrictions in place at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important for us to stay flexible and agile throughout this season, but we are looking forward to matches getting underway and supporters being able to watch their clubs and players in action again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Auld said the AFL would consider having crowds at matches later in the season if permitted by state governments, but it was simply a long-term prospect at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first block of games has been done on the basis that there isn&rsquo;t the ability for crowds, for fans to attend games,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that changes, we&rsquo;ll be the first to embrace that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cats to feel at home in Geelong</p>
<p>The Cats were among the clubs to welcome their draw for rounds two to five.</p>
<p>They will play three home matches against the Hawks, Blues and Suns at Kardinia Park.</p>
<p>The Cats are only on the road once during rounds two to five. ( AAP: David Crosling )</p>
<p>Their only away fixture during the period is against the Demons at the MCG in round four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The release of the fixture has created a buzz for everyone at the club, our members and supporters, as it moves us closer to being back on the field,&rdquo; Geelong chief executive Brian Cook said.</p>
<p>The Power will play at least three matches in south-east Queensland while based on the Gold Coast following the Showdown in round two.</p>
<p>Power chief executive Keith Thomas said the club was prepared to stay put on the Gold Coast if required to do so by the AFL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a &lsquo;play anyone, anywhere&rsquo; attitude and if it requires us to play several games in Queensland in succession we&rsquo;ll adapt to that,&rdquo; he said.

<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/23/19/pri152493313.jpg" alt="img">
Bayern Munich are brimming with confidence ahead of the top-of-the-table clash at second-placed Borussia Dortmund tonight.</p>
<p>Hansi Flickâs team enjoys an eight-game winning run in all competitions and top scorer Robert Lewandowski is in superb form as they lead the standings by four points.</p>
<p>The Bavarians have also scored 80 goals from 27 league matches â a Bundesliga record at this stage â after firing five past Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, while Thomas Muller leads the league in assists after setting one goal up and scoring another himself.</p>
<p>Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines</p>
<p>âThis is a decisive week. We are marching on, Dortmund are marching on so everyone can look forward to Tuesday,â said Muller, who has rediscovered his world-class form under Flick this season.</p>
<p>Fans, however, will not be cramming into the 80,000-seater Signal Iduna Park to see the leagueâs biggest match as spectators are banned from the games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is everything you need to know.</p>
<p>What time is it?</p>
<p>The match gets underway at 5.30pm BST.</p>
<p>How can I watch it?</p>
<p>BT Sport will be showing it on BT Sport 1.</p>
<p>You can either watch the match live on television or use the BT Sport app to watch online and on mobile.</p>
<p>What is the team news?</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmundâs Mats Hummels and Axel Witsel look set to be fit in time for Tuesdayâs Bundesliga big game against leaders Bayern Munich, with the Ruhr valley club attempting to cut the gap and stay in the running for the title.</p>
<p>Second-placed Dortmund, four points behind the Bavarians and without injured captain Marco Reus and defender Dan Axel Zagadou, know that failure to win could prove costly with seven games left in the campaign.</p>
<p>But coach Lucien Favre said central defender Hummels looks set to recover from a heel injury and fit-again midfielder Witsel was back in training.</p>
<p>Hummels was taken off at halftime in Saturdayâs 2-0 win at VfL Wolfsburg with a nagging heel injury. Belgium international Witsel has not played since the league restart 10 days ago.</p>
<p>âWe will have to see at the last minute but I think it will be alright, 99% Mats will be there,â Favre said on Monday. âAxel trained yesterday with the team again and could be in the squad.â</p>
<p>Dortmund will need all the help they can get against the in-form Bavarians, who like them have won six games in a row including the last two since the Bundesliga resumed following a break of more than two months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>With games played without fans for health safety reasons, Dortmund, who lost 4-0 at Bayern earlier in the season, will badly be missing the 80,000 crowd at their home stadium on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Favre said the team was stronger now than earlier in the campaign, following the arrival of Emre Can and Erling Haaland in the winter transfer window.</p>
<p>âWe do not think back to that first game. We have forgotten it. We did not play well,â Favre said.</p>
<p>âWe now play a system that better fits our squad and we have also brought in Emre Can and Erling Haaland as reinforcements in the winter who have further increased our quality.â</p>
<p>The 19-year-old Haaland has taken the Bundesliga by storm with 10 goals in his first 10 matches so far. Dortmund, however, will also need to stop Bayern from adding to their record haul of 80 goals this season, 27 of which have come from Robert Lewandowski.</p>

<p>What are the odds?</p>
<p>Bayern Munich: 5/6</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund: 14/5</p>
<p>Draw: 3/1</p>
<p>What is our prediction?</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund have a young squad full of exciting, talented players, with a thrillingly attacking philosophy. But this is Bayern Munich we are talking about. Bundesliga champions since 2013. FC Hollywood. The bad guys. They always win. Itâs just what they do.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Bayern Munich

<p>12pm AEST â Round 19, 2005: North Melbourne 15.14 (104) defeated Collingwood 14.14 (98)</p>
<p>One of the most incredible turnarounds of the century. Collingwood led by 18 points with just 3.21 minutes on the clock, while &lsquo;Joffa&rsquo; even had the gold jacket on. But three North Melbourne goals in less than a minute of playing time quickly had the scores level. Nathan Thompson&rsquo;s 50m set shot, with just four seconds left, then sealed a stunning Kangaroos win.</p>

<p>2.20pm AEST â Round 5, 2006: Fremantle 14.10 (94) defeated St Kilda 13.15 (93)</p>
<p>Who could forget &lsquo;Sirengate&rsquo;? Fremantle led by a point when the siren sounded in Launceston. The only issue? No umpire heard it. Despite the Dockers appealing that the game was over, play continued. Steven Baker earned a free kick, kicked a point (after a second siren) and seemingly earned a draw for the Saints. That was until three days later, when Fremantle was eventually awarded victory after a lengthy AFL Commission meeting.</p>

<p>Nic Naitanui, take a bow. West Coast trailed by five points with just eight seconds remaining when it had a boundary throw-in deep inside its forward 50. Naitanui scooped the ball, snapped truly and helped the Eagles secure a stunning buzzer-beater victory. It came after Greater Western Sydney had earlier led by 18 points deep into time-on.</p>

<p>12pm AEST â Round 10, 2015: Adelaide 14.15 (99) defeated Carlton 14.6 (90)</p>
<p>In what would prove champion Chris Judd&rsquo;s final game after a devastating ACL injury, Carlton challenged Adelaide right until the death. The lead changed hands multiple times in the final quarter as both sides traded five goals on the bounce, before the class of the Crows â along with five majors from Josh Jenkins â eventually willed the visitors over the line.</p>

<p>In what would have been Sir Doug Nicholls Round, we&rsquo;ve gone back to 2006 for the second ever Dreamtime at the &lsquo;G clash. Three consecutive Scott Lucas goals had put Essendon 10 points clear as we ticked into time-on, but Richmond would respond emphatically. Dean Polo&rsquo;s third of the night drew the Tigers level again, before crucial behinds from Jarrad Oakleigh-Nicholls and Andrew Krakouer secured victory.</p>

<p>How did they pull this off? Port Adelaide was seven points down with 48 seconds on the clock, but two goals in an instant from Daniel Motlop and Brett Ebert secured a remarkable win. The second of those back-to-back goals was delivered as the final siren sounded, with the Power coming out victorious despite trailing by 16 points at three-quarter time.</p>

<p>Melbourne trailed by 15 points at three-quarter time, but kicked six goals in the final quarter to miraculously claim the lead late in the match. That was until Brad Johnson produced another special moment.

<p>The first ever QClash turned into a final quarter shootout at the Gabba back in 2011. After Brisbane had fought back from 27 points down at half-time, the hosts just couldn&rsquo;t quite claim the lead. A tense final term included 11 goals between the two sides, with Jared Brennan and Nathan Krakouer ultimately guiding the younger Gold Coast home.</p>
<p>Stats stars: Jared Brennan (30 disposals, 14 clearances), Nathan Krakouer (16 disposals, five goals), Daniel Rich (26 disposals, three goals), Ashley McGrath (15 disposals, six goals)

<p>Leicester City and their Premier League rivals are expected to approve the introduction of phase two in training on Wednesday, prompting hope that a date for the return of the league could be made this week.</p>
<p>The Premier League has received government approval to progress to the next stage of Project Restart, which will enable competitive a close-contract training with a maximum group size of 12.</p>
<p>Players and managers will have the chance to discuss any remaining concerns over phase two when they hold separate video calls with the Premier League on Tuesday, Sky Sports states.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, clubs will then vote on whether to move to the next stage of training, which could be introduced at training grounds before the end of this week - and the week could end with the Premier League putting forward the final drafts of Project Restart, with a proposed fixture list, including the date when competitive action could resume.</p>

<p>An initial planned date of June 12 is now widely regarded to not be achievable and a delay is expected, potentially as far back as June 26 but June 19 remains a possible date for the Premier Leagueâs return.</p>
<p>Encouragement has been provided by the success of the Bundesligaâs return, with Germanyâs top-two divisions seeing two matchweeks pass by without a hitch and are set for the first round of midweek fixtures over the course of the coming days.</p>
<p>There are still a number of hurdles to overcome though, with a decision needing to be made around plans for a worst-case scenario if the season has to be curtailed at a later date, as well as contingency plans for relegation.</p>
<p>A demotion in divisions amid the current pandemic has been a fiercely debated topic, with some Premier League clubs already stating they believe relegation is unfair if the Championship campaign is not completed as well.
