<p>Update (June 1):</p>
<p>On Monday evening (June 1), Virgil responded to the severe criticism he received regarding the statement he made in defense of sneaker designer Sean Wotherspoon and the $50 donation he made to Fempower organization. &ldquo;I apologize that my comments yesterday appeared as if my main concerns are anything other than full solidarity with the movements against police violence, racism and inequality,&rdquo; he wrote in an Instagram post. &ldquo;I want to update all systems that don&rsquo;t address our current needs. It has been my personal MO in every realm I touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abloh also discussed his own personal experience as a Black man in Chicago and how he has often felt like his own life is at risk due to police brutality.</p>
<p>The fashion designer added that his donation to Fempower was &ldquo;in solidarity with a group of Miami friends chain-posting about coming together for their local community.&rdquo; Abloh also said that he has donated a total of $20,500 to bailout funds and other causes related to the movement in honor of George Floyd.</p>
<p>Original Story:</p>
<p>Rappers aren&rsquo;t keeping quiet on their thoughts about clothing designer Virgil Abloh following his recent comments about looting and his donation to help bail out demonstrators who are getting arrested while protesting the murder of George Floyd, who was killed by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minn. last month.</p>
<p>After posting an image of his $50 donation to Fempower, a Miami-based organization currently assisting protester bailouts during the George Floyd protests on Sunday (May 31), many hip-hop figures have spoken against the fashion designer&rsquo;s monetary contribution. However, the backlash also comes after Abloh criticized those who looted sneaker designer Sean Wotherspoon&rsquo;s Round Two store in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Prior to making his donation public, Virgil Abloh caught heat for commenting on a video Sean Wotherspoon posted to his Instagram page after his Round 2 store in Los Angeles had been looted during protests. “This is fucked up,&rdquo; Abloh wrote in the comment section. &ldquo;You see the passion blood sweat and tears Sean puts in for our culture. This disgusts me. To the kids that ransacked his store and RSVP DTLA, and all our stores in our scene just know, that product staring at you in your home/ apartment right now is tainted and a reminder of a person I hope you aren’t. We’re apart of a culture together. Is this what you want?? When you walk past him in the future please have the dignity to not look him in the eye, hang your head in shame&hellip;..”</p>
<p>He also wrote, &ldquo;If me and my friends tried to loot Alife, Supreme, aNYthing, Prohibit, Union etc. i would foresee a 40oz bottle hurtling at my head along with it,&rdquo; referring to a series of streetwear clothing stores, similar to Round 2.</p>

<p>In an Instagram story post, Abloh showed a screenshot of his contribution to help get protesters out of jail. However, when he only appeared to have donated $50, many found the amount of money as more of an insult than a helping contribution. Especially since Abloh&rsquo;s net worth is projected to be in the millions, his Off-White brand doesn&rsquo;t sell anything for less than that amount and neither does Louis Vuitton, the company where he is the men&rsquo;s artistic director.</p>
<p>virgilabloh via Instagram</p>
<p>Not only did Abloh catch flak on social media, but the biography on his Wikipedia page was edited. His profile was changed to Virgil &ldquo;Cheap Ass&rdquo; Abloh and the information that followed said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Virgil &ldquo;Cheap Ass&rsquo; Abloh is an American fashion designer, entrepreneur, artist, and DJ. Who once donated 50 dollars to the BLM movement during a protest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After receiving more than 237,000 tweets criticizing his actions, Abloh sent out a personal message to Instagram, explaining that he was only matching the donations he had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More light before a narrative forms around false assumptions,&rdquo; Abloh began. &ldquo;The $50 donation described in a recent screenshot was part of a matching funds movement of friends I follow in my timeline.&rdquo; The message has since been deleted.</p>
<p>Check out hip-hop&rsquo;s response to Virgil Abloh&rsquo;s donation below.

<h3 id="what-luxury-brands-can-learn-from-looting">&ldquo;What Luxury Brands Can Learn From Looting&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.gq.com/photos/5ed55eceecaa4e815a2afa42/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gq%2520june%25202020%2520In%2520Response%2520to%2520the%2520Protests,%2520Many%2520Designers%2520Struggle%2520to%2520Get%2520Political.jpg" alt="img">
This weekend, following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day, cities across the United States erupted with protests against systematic police aggression—portions of which damaged a number of businesses, including designer stores. After sitting dormant (and even boarded up) for nearly two months following the pandemic-mandated shutdown of nonessential businesses, major luxury retail thoroughfares, from New York’s Soho to Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Drive to Atlanta’s Phipps Plaza, are now covered in messages in support of Black Lives Matter and against the use of violent force by police. Many stores, both luxury and independent, have been looted, and left with windows smashed and merchandise stolen.</p>
<p>Designers and brands have spent the past four years trying to distinguish, with varying degrees of success, the difference between tepid support for social justice issues and true activism. The realities of looted stores and calls from consumers to speak out and do better have now brought many of those figures to a crossroads, including some who woke up Saturday and Sunday to news that their own stores had been vandalized. A number of writers, journalists, and activists have long sought to contextualize looting, but it remains a divisive issue. In the fashion industry, that is no exception.</p>
<p>Only a handful of designers and industry leaders have expressed support—tacit or overt—of the looting. Chris Gibbs, founder of the influential Los Angeles menswear store Union, posted his gratitude for messages about his store’s wellbeing on Instagram on Sunday, though emphasized, “But what I want people to remember is that the Genesis of this whole thing is that police are killing black people!!! Please don’t let the looting side show that’s going on distract your attention from the main stage, the main conversation we need to keep at the forefront.” On Sunday afternoon, after his ivy-bearded Melrose Place store was looted, Marc Jacobs posted to both his brand’s account and his personal account the image of his store’s sign, with his logo crossed out by protestors and the names of Sandra Bland, who was found hanged in a Texas jail cell in 2015 three days after being arrested for a traffic stop, and George Floyd written above and below. A few hours before, Jacobs posted another message of solidarity on his personal account: “NEVER let them convince you that broken glass or property is violence,” it read. “HUNGER is VIOLENCE. HOMELESSNESS is VIOLENCE…. Property can be replaced, human lives CANNOT.” Some commenters challenged Jacobs: “Are you crazy or what? What if they destroyed your stores?” Jacobs has replied to a number of critics, confirming that his store was looted and the posts would stay up. In large part, followers seem to support his messages.</p>
<p>But some of those expressions have been met with anger or skepticism. On Sunday morning, fashion historian Shelby Ivey Christie shared images of looted luxury stores on Rodeo Drive, commenting that “I can just see this being exploited as an ‘aesthetic’ in their campaigns to come.” A few hours later, she wrote of Jacobs’s post, “It’s started.” As Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond put it on Saturday afternoon, meaningful change will require more than social media engagement: “Not one of these companies have committed to any action. Commit to no longer working with the police. Commit to lending your in-house legal teams to reform these laws that cost us Black lives. No more stupid words with shit typeface.”</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum is Off-White designer and Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director Virgil Abloh, whose social media posts about the protests have been met with immense criticism. (As of Monday afternoon, his name was trending on Twitter.) Sharing images of the graffitied and looted Hollywood outpost of Round Two, the secondhand streetwear store co-founded by Sean Wotherspoon, Abloh wrote that the destruction of the store went against his definition of streetwear, which he believes has disappeared: “a group of friends that I’m surely was [sic] like, ‘C’mon guys, this is Sean’s store, we can’t treat him like this, we know Sean.” (Abloh was referencing an interview he gave to Dazed at the end of 2019 prophesying the end of the subculture he helped propel to international, high-fashion renown. Wotherspoon, who originally posted the images that Abloh shared to his story, was also criticized for posting images of his store but no messages of support for the protestors, though he appears to have responded to several commenters that he’s less worried about the store than he is about the unequal treatment of black Americans by police.) In a subsequent story, Abloh wrote that “if me and my friends tried to loot Alife, Supreme, aNYthing, Prohibit, Union etc. i would foresee a 40oz bottle hurtling at my head along with it”—a gesture toward the tight-knit streetwear community of his youth, maybe, but one that seemed to ignore the fact that the activists marching over the past six days have been exposed to much more serious violence, like pepper spray and rubber bullets, at the hands of police.

<h3 id="fetty-waps-ex-wife-exposes-real-reason-for-their-sudden-divorce-after-just-9-days">&ldquo;Fetty Wap’s Ex-Wife EXPOSES Real Reason For Their Sudden Divorce After Just 9 Days&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fetty-Wap-Leandra-Gonzalez-Divorce.jpg" alt="img">
Fetty Wap’s ex-wife Leandra Gonzalez took to Instagram Live to dish on why their marriage did not work out. She claims that the rapper isn’t the nicest man behind the scenes and knows that she wasn’t in the relationship for the money.</p>
<p>Fetty Wap And Leandra Never Signed A Prenup</p>
<p>You would think someone who had an estimated net worth of $8 million would be encouraged to make his future spouse sign a prenup to preserve his assets in the wake of divorce. But, Leandra revealed that Fetty never asked her to sign a prenup ahead of their October 2019 wedding. She said that people are saying that she is money-hungry and that it’s the only thing she cares about. Leandra insists that she knows how to make her own money and that Fetty knows that as well.</p>
<p>SEE ALSO: WOW! CELINA POWELL LEAKS HER OWN S*X TAPE WITH 6IX9INE AND SNOOP DOGG &amp; YOU CAN SEE IT FOR $29.25</p>
<p>But, one thing she really honed in on is that she wants to hold the rapper accountable for his actions. The actions in question are no doubt the allegations of abuse that Leandra made against Fetty. Leandra filed documents a month after they got married alleging that the pair got into a physical altercation. Fetty reportedly hit Leandra in the face causing her bruising and a black eye. That was only one of the factors that played into their divorce. In a now-deleted tweet, Leandra said “It originally had nothing to do with the young lady this man is parading around town with. Yall don’t have to send me all these pics and stuff I’m good… trust me.” This implies that the rapper was seeing other women while the pair were still married.</p>
<p>Fetty Tried To Win Leandra Back After Split</p>
<p>Fetty thought that the way to Leandra’s heart would be to buy her gifts. In March 2020, right when he was served with divorce papers, he bought her a brand new G-Wagon. This is interesting considering Leandra made it clear that she isn’t interested in money and material things. The other interesting thing is that Leandra threatened divorce for months before she finally filed the paperwork. What kept her hanging on for so long. Especially since Fetty was accused of having several mistresses during their short marriage and even allegedly got one of their names tattooed on his wrist. The rapper has denied all of the allegations of adultery.</p>

<p>During the Instagram Live session, she made a point that she does not want to keep publicizing this incident or making her personal business known to the world. But, we can take that with a grain of salt since she announced this on social media to her followers who are very invested in this drama. “It is what it is” says Leandra multiple times. Fetty and Leandra did not even date that long before they got married. It was no shock to some when she revealed she was seeking a divorce just nine days after they wed.</p>

<p>We hope the pair can just settle things peacefully away from social media and got heir separate ways.

<h3 id="thomas-rhett-wife-lauren-stand-up-against-racism-for-their-black-daughter">&ldquo;Thomas Rhett, wife Lauren stand up against racism for their black daughter&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://filmyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Thomas-Rhett-wife-Lauren-stand-up-against-racism-for-their.jpgquality90stripallw1200.jpeg" alt="img">
Thomas Rhett and wife Lauren Akins spoke out Sunday in the wake of George Floyd’s death, taking a stand against racism while addressing their own experiences as the parents of a black daughter, 4-year-old Willa Gray.</p>
<p>“As the father of a black daughter and also two white daughters- I have struggled with what to say today,” the country singer posted to Instagram. “We have navigated forms of racism directly and while there is mostly overwhelming support and love for our family, sometimes there is just the opposite. Because of that fear, it can be a lot easier to choose silence, but today I’m choosing to speak.”</p>
<p>Rhett, who adopted Willa from Uganda in 2017 with his wife, added that he has “no clue what it feels like to be profiled by authorities, treated negatively or have my life threatened because of the color of my skin.”</p>
<p>“When I witnessed the horrific murder of George and think about the mistreatment of other black men and women in America, I am heartbroken and angry,” Rhett stated. “I get scared when I think about my daughters and what kind of world they will be growing up in and how my JOB as a father is to show them how to lead with love in the face of hate.”</p>
<p>Rhett said he wants his daughters — Willa, 2-year-old Ada and 5-month-old Lennon — “to know their worth and value as not only women but human beings.”</p>
<p>“I have witnessed my black band and crew members on the road struggle at times with feeling safe because of the color of their skin. This is unacceptable,” Rhett continued. “I don’t believe in hate. I believe in love. What happened to George was pure hate. We are all created by the same God.”</p>
<p>Rhett added that he’s not only praying for “a change in heart of those hearts who have been overcome by hatred and hardened,” he also yearns for “a deeper understanding for myself and awareness of the experience of mistreatment that those of another skin color go through.”</p>
<p>In a separate Instagram post, Akins — who has been married to Rhett since 2012 — said she’s “been nervous to post anything in the past and even now because of how some people believe that I as a white mother am undeserving or incapable of raising a black daughter.”</p>
<p>“I believe that shaming comes from people who choose to see only my white skin and her brown skin and refuse to see our hearts and love for each other,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Though Akins experienced anxiety over fear of sharing her “heart on social media,” she wants daughter Willa to know she will forever stand up for her.</p>
<p>“I want her to be VERY sure that I am HER mother who stands up not only for her, but for every single person who shares her beautiful brown skin,” Atkins posted. “I want to be her mother who raises her to know what it means to have brown skin and to be proud of it. I want to be her mother who doesn’t listen to the shaming of skin colors but instead listens to the Spirit of God who knitted every skin color together in their mother’s womb for His glory.”</p>
<p>Akins added that she believes she’s being “disobedient to God” if she does not “speak up against injustice and fight for change.”

<p><img src="https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2020121/rs_600x600-200221152648-600-virgil-abloh-paris-fashion-week.jpg?fit=around%7C600:467&amp;crop=600:467;center,top&amp;output-quality=90" alt="img">
That series of things started years ago for the 39-year-old artist and entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Born in Rockford, Ill., he and his sister were raised in a middle-class household and attended a Catholic high school where the kids wore uniforms. Dad Nee managed a paint company and his mother, Eunice, a seamstress, taught him how to sew. Abloh played varsity soccer and deejayed on weekends. He graduated with a degree in civil engineering from University of Wisconsin-Madison and then earned a master&rsquo;s in architecture from Illinois Institute of Technology, concentrating on the work of Mies van der Rohe and Rem Koolhaas. His first foray into the fashion business was designing T-shirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just, like, an average sort of suburban kid, born in 1980, into watching Michael Jordan or listening to Guns N&rsquo; Roses or NWA, skateboarding and that whole aesthetic,&rdquo; Abloh told the Times in 2017. &ldquo;That was my fashion upbringing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was through the rapper&rsquo;s favored Chicago printing shop that Abloh first crossed paths with Kanye West. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all the children of Kanye&rsquo;s trailblazing,&rdquo; Abloh told W in 2017. &ldquo;This generation wouldn&rsquo;t have the freedom to cross genres had it not been for his passion to find more than what was delivered to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They became fast friends and, in 2009, they both interned at Fendi—where, West would later claim, he and Abloh came up with the idea for leather joggers that the Italian fashion house summarily dismissed. &ldquo;Whether I&rsquo;m at a dinner with Anna Wintour, or I&rsquo;m at a listening session with Pusha, or me and Virgil are in Rome giving designs to Fendi over and over and getting our designs knocked down,&rdquo; West said on BBC Radio One in 2013. &ldquo;We brought the leather jogging pants six years ago to Fendi, and they said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; How many motherf&ndash;kers you done seen with a jogging pant?&rdquo;

<p>A week after the couple exchanged vows for the second time, Hailey Baldwin, Justin Bieber’s wife, has revealed the gown she wore for the special occasion.</p>
<p>She posted several pictures of her Off-White dress, a label by American designer Virgil Abloh, on her Instagram account, captioning one image: “@virgilabloh thank you for making my vision come to life and creating my dream dress.

<h3 id="stars-reminisce-over-met-gala-on-what-should-have-been-the-2020-event">&ldquo;Stars reminisce over Met Gala on what should have been the 2020 event&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bromsgroveadvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/11333118/" alt="img">
Celebrities have reminisced over the Met Gala on the day the 2020 event would have been held had it not been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Usually taking place on the first Monday of May each year, the Met Gala attracts the biggest names in showbiz for fashion’s ultimate event.</p>
<p>The gala, which has a different theme every 12 months, is synonymous with glitz and glamour as the world’s biggest designers spend months preparing to dress A-listers in elaborate and extravagant outfits.</p>
<p>This year’s exhibition, titled About Time: Fashion and Duration, was cancelled in March, with New York, the city which hosts the show at the Metropolitan Museum Of Art, becoming the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>On the day they should have been walking up the Met’s famous staircase, celebrities shared their favourite memories of the show.</p>
<p>Kim Kardashian West, always one of the stand-out stars at the Met Gala, marked the occasion by posting pictures of her favourite outfits online.</p>
<p>They included dresses from Vivienne Westwood and Versace, as well as the eye-catching Thierry Mugler outfit from last year, which was designed to make the star look like she was dripping wet.</p>
<p>Her sister and fellow gala regular Kylie Jenner also posted some of her favourite looks on Instagram.</p>
<p>They included a silver embellished gown by Balmain from 2016 and a Versace gown she wore the following year.</p>
<p>Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts posted a picture from inside her bathroom, showing her wearing a ball gown while holding a drink and standing at the window.</p>
<p>“Here’s me…not going to the Met Ball tonight,” she captioned the post, adding the hashtags #stayhome #yesyoustillhavetostayhome.</p>
<p>Her niece, the actress Emma Roberts, shared a picture of her in a pink dress and said: “In a parallel universe we’re at the #met tonight.”</p>
<p>Hailey Bieber, model and wife of pop star Justin, posted a picture from the 2019 gala showing her Alexander Wang dress.</p>
<p>She said: “Thinking back on all the amazing and fun memories the first Monday in May always brings… can’t wait till we can do it all again and again and again.”</p>
<p>Singer Rita Ora shared snaps of her and her famous friends at previous galas, including Miley Cyrus and Kate Moss, and said: “Love you all cant wait to see you all soon.”</p>
<p>Rita Wilson, singer, actress and wife of Tom Hanks, paid tribute to fashion designer Miuccia Prada as she looked back on her trips to New York.</p>
<p>Wilson, who recently recovered from coronavirus, said: “I love Miuccia PRADA as a woman, an artist, a philanthropist, a mother, a wife and nature lover.</p>
<p>“She is down to earth, a rebel, a warrior. All with kindness.”</p>
<p>Former Victoria’s Secret angel Lily Aldridge said the gala “is an event I look forward to every year” and posted some of her outfits from previous shows.</p>
<p>Actress Chloe Grace Moretz revealed she would have been wearing an outfit from French fashion designer Nicolas Ghesquiere for this year’s show, but said it is “incredibly important” to stay indoors to halt the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>She added: “I can’t wait till we are healthy and safe to be able to bring everyone together for this amazing event in the near future.”</p>
<p>In place of a regular Met Gala, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour hosted a special livestream to celebrate the history of the event.</p>
<p>A Moment With the Met featured a performance from Florence Welch and a DJ set from Virgil Abloh.
