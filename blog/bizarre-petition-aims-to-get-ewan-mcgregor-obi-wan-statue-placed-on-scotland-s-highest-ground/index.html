<p>A petition aiming to get a Ewan McGregor statue placed on Scotland&rsquo;s highest ground has reached over 15,000 signatures.</p>
<p>The appeal is calling for a life size statue of him in Obi Wan Kenobi character at the summit of Scotland&rsquo;s tallest mountain.</p>
<p>The campaign is a riff off of Ewan McGregor&rsquo;s character&rsquo;s popularity with a large section of the internet community for his &ldquo;You were my brother Anakin&rdquo; speech in Revenge of the Sith which features the now famous &ldquo;I have the high ground&rdquo; line.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty)</p>
<p>Connor Heggie&rsquo;s petition, which started as an April Fool&rsquo;s joke, has seen over 15,000 people signing it, declared that the Scottish star&rsquo;s most iconic role should be commemorated properly, he said: &ldquo;A statue of Obi Wan Kenobi would be rather fitting, given the mountain&rsquo;s nickname (the Ben), the volcanic past and its the highest ground of Ewan McGregor&rsquo;s home county. He would literally have &lsquo;the high ground&rsquo;, watching over all of Scotland. It&rsquo;s poetic in a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Star Wars fan suggested that it could be made from any durable material such as copper, marble or stone, so long as there was a plaque with another of Obi Wan&rsquo;s famous lines - &ldquo;Hello there&rdquo; - added to welcome walkers to the site.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;It would also have its benefits too, as the mountain would increase in popularity. Those estimated ascents would increase. You would have Star Wars fans from around the world coming to Scotland to climb Ben Nevis to reach &lsquo;the high ground&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ewan McGregor starred as the younger Obi-Wan Kenobi - the role made famous by Sir Alec Guinness - in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy.</p>
<p>The Trainspotting star&rsquo;s uncle Denis Lawson, played rebel pilot Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy.</p>
<p>Ben Nevis is one of Scotland&rsquo;s most popular tourist destinations, attracting an estimated 150,000 ascents a year.

That&rsquo;s right, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith star Hayden Christensen may very well make a triumphant-adjacent return to the role of Anakin Skywalker for Disney+'s standalone Obi-Wan Kenobi project, at least according to LRM.com. The outlet claims that the actor is &ldquo;currently in talks&rdquo; with show producers about reprising the morally imbalanced man destined to become the iconic Darth Vader. If true, the news would certainly be one of the more polarizing developments that the mighty Disney+ could bring into existence.

Ahsoka Tano Might Also Be Involved In The Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus Series</p>
<p>It’s being rumoured that Ahsoka Tano might be involved in some capacity in the upcoming Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus series.</p>
<p>This rumour comes from The Illuminerdi’s sources, which means it might not be 100% accurate.</p>
<p>However, I’ve heard a few outlets report that Disney and Lucasfilm are thinking of bringing Rosario Dawson’s version of Ahsoka Tano into more properties.</p>
<p>It was revealed a few weeks ago that Dawson will be playing the iconic Star Wars character.</p>
<p>Tano’s appeared in the animated Star Wars TV shows such as Star Wars: Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.</p>
<p>Star Wars fans got so excited about Ahsoka coming over to The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>Will Ahsoka Tano be in Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus?</p>
<p>Read more:</p>
<p>According to The Illuminerdi’s sources, Tano will play a part in the Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus.</p>
<p>We know that before the whole Coronavirus pandemic, they were about to start filming on the Kenobi series.</p>
<p>Ewan McGregor will be returning as the legendary Jedi Master.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan has interacted with Tano in the animated series, and they know one another pretty well.</p>
<p>It would be so cool if Tano paid him a visit, maybe to tell him what’s been going on with Darth Vader.</p>

Will Obi-Wan Kenobi Get More Than One Season?</p>
<p>One of the most highly-anticipated Star Wars projects on the way has to be the Obi-Wan Kenobi series featuring Ewan McGregor reprising his role from the prequel trilogy. The show is set to pick up eight years after Revenge of the Sith. Fans had every reason to believe that Obi-Wan was simply meditating in the desert on Tatooine for the better part of two decades before the events of A New Hope, so the show should reveal that more was going on for Obi-Wan than we knew. But will he get more than one season?

<p>The Red Sox have a lot of work to do before contending to win the AL East again by Brian Johnston</p>

<p>A new report has details on the Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney+, and it revealed that the series could have taken place on Tatooine following the rise of the Empire.</p>
<p>The Obi-Wan Kenobi series coming to Disney+ has been in a state of limbo recently, and that hasn’t been due to the COVID-19 production halts. Long before the outbreak happened, the series had been rumored to be canceled, and changes in its creators have led to the series possibly heading in a new director.</p>
<p>Now, as reported by The Illuminerdi, there are new details about what the series’ original premise would have been about. They report that there was a working logline for the series which seemingly established the show to take place on Tatooine — the home of Anakin and Luke Skywalker.</p>
<p>Here’s what the reported working summary for the show starring Ewan McGregor was about:</p>
<p>Tatooine, a desert planet where farmers work hard under the heat of two suns. Meanwhile, they try to defend themselves and their loved ones from the marauders Tusken. A planet behind the edge of civilization. And a place where it would be unlikely to find a Jedi Master, or an orphan child on whom the future of the entire galaxy weighs on its small shoulders.</p>
<p>From what it looks like, the original plot of the series was all about shedding a light on Tatooine and deepening the lore behind the planet. While the original trilogy gave us little beyond Luke’s home and the cantina — and the prequel trilogy gave us, well, podracing — it looks like the creators wanted to base a whole series on just Tatooine and what life on the planet would have been like for Luke.</p>
<p>It must be mentioned, then, that Luke Skywalker seems to be referenced in this series as the “orphan child” (unless there’s another prodigy kid who was left out of the narrative Broom Kid-style). Even then, it’s unknown whether a young Luke would have played a large role in the series or if it would have been a brief moment that teased the young child’s appearance.</p>

<p>Overall, the summary for the show lacked a central focus on the main character, Obi-Wan, and instead seems like it wanted the planet Tatooine to be the main character. Perhaps the reason why the series is getting an overhaul is to give it more of a personal touch toward Obi-Wan while also making sure it doesn’t tread too much into being like The Mandalorian or the upcoming Cassian Andor series.</p>
<p>The direction of the series is up in the air, but it could be possible that we see Tatooine in some capacity once it’s out. How it relates to the overall plot and Obi-Wan Kenobi’s involvement, though, will remain to be seen.

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/darth_vader.jpg" alt="img">
Say what you want about the Star Wars prequels — and a lot has already been said — but Revenge of the Sith is actually one of the best Star Wars movies. Even from just the significance of it, it shows Anakin Skywalker’s fall from the Light Side as well as the creation of the best villain in the franchise: Darth Vader. George Lucas has said that Anakin’s story is the core of the franchise before the sequel trilogy came to be. So seeing this missing piece to Anakin’s story was pivotal.</p>
<p>And when it comes to the action, Revenge of the Sith comes out on top too. So, on the movie’s 15th anniversary, let’s break down why Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi’s duel on Mustafar is one of the best fights in all of Star Wars. And it’s not all just about the duel itself.</p>
<p>Darth Vader at the European premiere of ‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ at Cineworld Leicester Square on December 18, 2019 | Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for Disney</p>
<p>The scene has so much drama and heartache leading up to it</p>
<p>As stated above, this duel comes at one of the most significant moments in the movie. Anakin struggled the entire film with his new visions of Padmé and his track record of murderous dreams coming true. Not to mention, he was getting no emotional support from the Jedi; Yoda told him to just let go. That’s not really something Anakin knew how to do.</p>
<p>His turmoil at being weak and aiding in Mace Windu’s death is eating away at him. His despair at being a part of the Jedi Order’s destruction is destroying him. The moment we see before Padmé comes to Mustafar of Anakin crying is really one of the most heartbreaking. He’s ashamed at what he’s done, but he’s so far gone that there’s no turning back in his mind. He also is so deadset on this path to the Dark Side because it’s the only route that holds hope for saving his wife from death.</p>
<p>The devastation of Order 66 is waging around them. The Clone Wars really captured this well, but even in the film, the death of all the Jedi falls on Anakin’s shoulders. Let’s not forget the younglings, too.</p>
<p>One of the greatest mistakes that is made when talking about Revenge of the Sith is to minimize the pain he’s feeling here. Anakin was doomed from the start. This tragic story comes to a climax here and shows a boy who just wanted connection away from his sand-ridden home. Who then dreamed of being a powerful Jedi, but was put down at every turn.</p>
<p>RELATED: Why Was Anakin Skywalker Denied the Rank of Master in ‘Star Wars’?</p>
<p>Anakin is almost unrecognizable to those that love him</p>
<p>That’s not to say, though, that Anakin didn’t have people in his life who had faith in him. Obi-Wan Kenobi was actually blinded by his love for Anakin as his brother that he couldn’t see the turmoil behind his former Padawan.</p>
<p>And until the very end, Padmé doesn’t believe all that Anakin’s done until she sees him with her own eyes. Star Wars: The Clone Wars does a really good job of showing how strong Anakin and Padmé’s relationship actually is and that they went through a lot of ups and downs. She wasn’t just blindly in love with him, and knew of his faults. But the thought that he would turn to the Dark Side was so unimaginable.</p>
<p>Even bringing it back to Ahsoka, who’s on Mandalore at this point. She would rather duel a former Sith Lord than believe Anakin would become Sidious’ apprentice. Anakin’s good heart and deeds as a Jedi overshadowed any darkness that may have been lurking in him in the eyes of his friends. That’s why the scene of him arguing with Padmé and then choking her, followed by his delusions of grandeur and Obi-Wan, hits so hard. It’s not the Anakin they know, but the one that is left after Palpatine’s manipulations.</p>
<p>The epic fight choreography, of course, is some of the best</p>

<p>And yes, the duel itself is some of the best visuals ever seen in Star Wars. Mustafar is one of the most pivotal scenes in the whole franchise, not just the movie. Without this moment, and its result, Darth Vader as we know him would never have come to be. And even though audiences knew Obi-Wan would strike him down in some way, the following duel was epic beyond belief.</p>
<p>The emotion that’s mentioned above comes to a breaking point, and the lava pouring throughout Mustafar is a stunning backdrop. Anakin is older, but he still has waves of overconfidence, which is seen throughout the duel. But Anakin is also insanely powerful. The choreography is unmatched, and it shows how well-paired they are. Because even though Anakin is powerful, Obi-Wan is also one of the best. And someone who taught Anakin everything he knows. This is displayed when they have a stalemate halfway through their fight because they’re doing the same moves.</p>
<p>From the moment it starts until the end, it’s epic. Not to mention “Battle of the Heroes” in the background elevates it even more. After Obi-Wan cuts Anakin down, the yellow eyes of the Sith stare back as he yells his hate for his former master.</p>
<p>Revenge of the Sith is the best prequel film and one of the best in Star Wars. It’s no wonder that so many things hinge on this one movie, and duel.</p>

<h3 id="the-synopsis-of-the-disneys-obi-wan-series-leaked">&ldquo;The synopsis of the Disney+’s Obi Wan series leaked&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://summary.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/obi-wan-disney-1.jpg" alt="img">
Disney’s streaming platform is already working on its most-expected series from the Star Wars universe, a show based on Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>
<p>Disney+ is investing heavily in its original content catalog to seriously compete in the streaming platform war. And now, after learning that Obi-Wan Kenobi’s series already had a screenwriter, we get the news that the official synopsis of the series was leaked.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi will be played again by Ewan McGregor, who is already comfortable in the role after playing the Jedi Knight in George Lucas’ prequel trilogy. What we know about the plot of this new series is that it will unfold between the events of The Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.</p>
<p>The series will have Deborah Chow as the showrunner, who will direct six episodes and oversee production.</p>
<p>But enough of the small talk, let’s see the official synopsis for once:</p>
<p>“Tatooine, a desert planet where farmers work hard under the heat of two suns. Meanwhile, they try to defend themselves and their loved ones from the Tusken marauders. A planet behind the edge of civilization. And a place where it would be unlikely to find a Jedi master, or an orphan child on whom the future of the entire galaxy weighs on its small shoulders.</p>
<p>Just reading it made me nostalgic, and I’m sure I’m not the only one. For now, we’ll have to wait, Disney+ is working hard on this series, but the global pandemic is affecting the speed at which things were being done.</p>
<p>No doubt more details of the series will come out, and of course, we’ll be covering them.
