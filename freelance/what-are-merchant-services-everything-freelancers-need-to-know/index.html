          <p>&ldquo;Did I ever get paid for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I send over that invoice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sorry, I don&rsquo;t have any cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are any of these sounding familiar?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one the thousands of workers making a living through freelancing, you&rsquo;ve probably had one of these moments. Maybe it was you asking yourself or you heard it from a potential client.</p>
<p>Merchant services can help you manage your freelance related financials, with everything from collecting payments to technology setup.</p>
<p>Keep reading to understand exactly what are merchant services and how you can use the package to make the most of your freelancing career.</p>
<p>What Are Merchant Services?</p>
<p>When people think of freelancers, they often think of writers and photographers, but you can consider yourself a freelancer if you run a small online shop or even if you nanny in the community.</p>
<p>Think of merchant services as a package. Essentially, different platforms and financial institutions offer a variety of different payment solutions to keep your finances organized.</p>
<p>Everything from software to help you accept payments to specific products to integrate online shops is available.</p>
<p>Why Do You Need Merchant Services?</p>
<p>Merchant services are not only a way to stay organized, but they also provide a safety aspect.</p>
<p>When a client gives their credit card information, the payment from their bank is almost instantaneously transferred to your bank, and a lot of personal information has the chance to be revealed during this time.</p>
<p>Merchant services provide a safety net or protection during this transaction so that not only you but also your clients are protected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if I only accept cash?&rdquo; you might ask.</p>
<p>Research has shown that most people prefer to pay with their credit cards. Even if you&rsquo;ve got a stall at a local farmer&rsquo;s market, odds are that most people, especially younger generations, are more likely to buy if you offer cashless payments.</p>
<p>Long story short, you should be accepting most types of payment! You&rsquo;ll increase your revenue and your customer base.</p>
<p>What Do Merchant Services Do Exactly?</p>
<p>Credit and Debit Card Processing: Merchant services provide the technology and software to accept credit and debit card payments from clients. They also protect the data of both your business accounts and your clients' accounts. Online Payments in All Currencies: If you want to sell anything online, not only do you need extra payment security and technology, but you also need to be able to accept all types of payment. Merchant services provide a payment gateway that encrypts data to your merchant account. Virtual Terminal: A virtual terminal allows you to accept credit card payments with a computer instead of a credit card machine. This is vital for businesses that accept telephone or mail-order sales. Check Payments: No more waiting around for days to see if the check is actually cashed. With the proper merchant services, you&rsquo;ll be able to move money from a client&rsquo;s account to yours in a matter of minutes. Sale System Data: One of the most valuable parts of joining a merchant services platform is that you&rsquo;ll have access to your sales data in one, easy to use place. You&rsquo;ll learn where most of your customers are from and be able to see if there are any purchasing patterns. Make sure that whatever system you use allows you a free trial or a money-back test run so that you get the most out of the platform. Additionally, find a merchant services provider that has great customer services. It&rsquo;s worth its weight in gold! Customer Retention: Some providers offer support for customer retention, such as loyalty programs or gift card services. These are helpful to keep your customers returning, but they do require special technology to use, so make sure your merchant services provider has this. Cash-Advance Loans: Many merchant services providers also have cash advance or loan options. As your business grows, you may need to bring on staff, purchase new equipment, or invest in a new workspace. Working with a merchant service provider that offers loans can be valuable for your business.</p>
