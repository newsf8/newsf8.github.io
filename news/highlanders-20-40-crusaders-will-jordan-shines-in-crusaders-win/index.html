<p>5:15 Highlights of the Super Rugby Aotearoa clash between the Highlanders and Crusaders Highlights of the Super Rugby Aotearoa clash between the Highlanders and Crusaders</p>
<p>The Crusaders stepped up a gear in the second half to beat the Highlanders 40-20 and move top of the Super Rugby Aotearoa table.</p>
<p>The Highlanders had held a 17-14 lead at half-time, but the Crusaders found another gear when they needed to and scored five tries to two to come out on top.</p>
<p>Winger Will Jordan crossed once in each half as the Crusaders moved to the top of the table with their third victory in the competition, setting up a potential title decider with the unbeaten Blues next week in Christchurch.</p>
<p>Will Jordan produced another superb display for the Crusaders</p>
<p>Loose forward Tom Christie also scored two second-half tries for the Crusaders as they relentlessly ground down the Highlanders.</p>
<p>It had looked ominous for the Highlanders as the Crusaders jumped out to an 8-0 lead through a Richie Mo&rsquo;unga penalty and Jordan&rsquo;s try and were dominating the scrum.</p>
<p>Highlanders and All Blacks scrum-half Aaron Smith, however, began to direct his pack better and they stormed back with tries by Shannon Frizell and winger Ngane Punivai to take a 14-8 lead.</p>
<p>Sam Whitelock runs into contact</p>
<p>Two Mo&rsquo;unga penalties dragged the Crusaders back into the game before Mitchell Hunt&rsquo;s penalty gave the home side a 17-14 advantage on the stroke of half-time.</p>
<p>Jordan continued to stamp his mark after half-time, his run setting up Christie&rsquo;s first try after the visitors dominated the opening 10 minutes of the second period.</p>
<p>The Highlanders effectively gave the Crusaders the only chance they needed to close out the game when replacement hooker Ash Dixon and winger Jona Nareki both failed to pass the ball to unmarked players less than 10 metres from the line.</p>
<p>Aaron Smith breaks for the Highlanders</p>
<p>Crusaders winger Sevu Reece gave them breathing room shortly afterwards before the visitors controlled possession to shift the momentum back in their favour.</p>
<p>Christie ensured victory three minutes from time with his second try before Jordan completed the scoring to complete his second successive two-try performance.

<h3 id="will-annexation-mark-the-end-of-jordans-peace-treaty-with-israel">&ldquo;Will annexation mark the end of Jordan&rsquo;s peace treaty with Israel&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/file/getimagecustom/84545cc8-3cd8-4a70-9ab8-73046e66e6a4/600/338" alt="img">
Many fear that annexation will mark the end of the two-state solution, which has been strongly promoted by Jordan&rsquo;s King Abdullah, as there would not be much land left on which Palestinians could establish a viable independent state.</p>
<p>With Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidency potentially due to expire in November, Israeli ultranationalist and far-right blocs believe that the time is ripe to take action.</p>
<p>In May, King Abdullah said in an interview with the German Der Spiegel magazine said that &ldquo;if Israel really annexes the West Bank in July, it would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.&rdquo; He also noted that he was studying &ldquo;all options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, Jordan&rsquo;s Prime Minister Omar al-Razzaz has said annexing parts of the West Bank will force the country &ldquo;to review all aspects of our relations with Israel,&rdquo; while the country&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi noted that such a move would have &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; consequences and would not pass without a Jordanian response.</p>
<p>Accumulated anger</p>
<p>Given that at least half of Jordan&rsquo;s 9.5 million citizens are of Palestinian origin, and almost 2.2 million Palestinians are registered with the United Nations as refugees, it is very possible that Israeli annexation may trigger an explosive reaction from Jordan&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Many fear that Israeli annexation will mark the end of the two-state solution, which has been strongly promoted by Jordan</p>
<p>But so far, Jordan, which is one of only two Arab states to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, has not disclosed what measures it intends to take. This domestic pressure will only increase if King Abdullah does not give the impression that he is taking sufficient diplomatic steps against Israel.</p>
<p>Dr. Shehab Al-Makahleh, a senior media and policy adviser in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, says that so far Jordan has only increased its diplomatic activity at a regional and international level.</p>
<p>The Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al-Safadi made an unannounced visit to Ramallah, for example, in which he met the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and delivered a message from the Jordanian monarch reiterating his support for a two-state solution. But the question is, who will respond to this call?</p>
<p>Speaking to The New Arab, Eugene Rogan, Director of the Middle East Center at St. Anthony College, said following the Trump administration&rsquo;s unveiling of its pro-Israel peace plan he was surprised &ldquo;by the muted reaction in the streets of Amman - there was anger, but no major demonstrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, much has changed since then, and in his view people have had five months to build anger at the injustice of annexation of Palestinian territory, following decades of indignation at discriminatory Israeli and US policies towards Palestinians.</p>
<p>Dr. Curtis Ryan, Professor of Political Science at the North Carolina based Appalachian State University, added that the anger in Jordan about Israeli annexation is already there, but if Israel proceeds apace with its plans it will hit fever pitch. It is important to stress, he says, that it is not only Palestinian- Jordanians who feel this way.</p>
<p>The peace treaty with Israel, already unpopular with Jordanians, could prove a domestic political liability</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jordanians of almost every background, as well as left and right-wing forces and both opposition and the monarchy itself, are opposed to annexation. In an odd way, the extremist policies of the Netanyahu administration have often had the effect of uniting Jordanian public opinion,&rdquo; he told The New Arab.</p>
<p>Jordan has neither the means nor the will to engage in military conflict. But its peace with Israel, already unpopular with Jordanians who oppose normalisation with the Jewish state, would prove a domestic political liability and Rogan expects King Abdullah and the government to take immediate and visible measures to downgrade relations with Israel.</p>
<p>Fragile peace treaty</p>
<p>It is still not known to what extent Netanyahu intends to annex parts of the West Bank. Last April, he pledged to apply Israeli sovereignty to all 130 Jewish settlements and outposts. In September, he said that Israel would also annex the Jordan Valley, which forms roughly 30 percent of the West Bank.</p>
<p>However, some speculate that if he proceeds with annexation it will be largely symbolic, extending sovereignty to several Israeli settlements around Jerusalem while excluding the Jordan Valley, at least for now.</p>
<p>But as many Jordanians have noted, in the last several years Netanyahu and his government seem determined to disregard Jordanian concerns and objections. To say that Israel is taking Jordan for granted would be an understatement, Ryan says.</p>
<p>But even with limited options for Jordan, unilateral annexation would be a disaster for the Palestinian people, for Jordan, for Jordanian-Israeli relations, and also for Israeli security as well, he adds.</p>
<p>If Israel moves ahead with its plans, Al-Makahleh believes that Jordan will withdraw its ambassador from Israel, dismiss the Israeli ambassador to Jordan, suspend the Israeli gas deal with Jordan and suspend the peace treaty, which could entail ceasing security cooperation with Israeli forces.</p>
<p>Coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, Rogan said that Jordan will not want to do anything to jeopardise its standing as a pillar of regional peace, but will need to balance a measured response to any annexation with keeping the confidence of the Jordanian public.</p>
<p>Rogan expects that Jordan would take visible measures to distance the Kingdom from Israel&rsquo;s actions, but he &ldquo;would not expect them to sever ties permanently with Israel or abrogate the peace treaty.&rdquo; He predicts a deep freeze to begin with and a gradual thaw in line with public opinion.</p>
<p>Between the hammer and the anvil</p>
<p>Ultimately, the predicament for Jordan is untenable. While its citizens demand a firm response to Israeli annexation, analysts say that the country has more to lose than gain if it makes dramatic moves to challenge Israel.</p>
<p>While its citizens demand a firm response to annexation, Jordan has a lot to lose if it makes dramatic moves to challenge Israel</p>
<p>While the country may suspend security cooperation, Israel provides crucial intelligence to Jordan, without which the government would face tremendous risks and find it difficult to cope with regional instability and domestic insurgency. In addition, suspending gas agreements would also cause great damage to Jordan economically.</p>
<p>Moreover, Amman must take a cautious approach to avoid provoking the Trump administration, as the US, despite its clear and one-sided support for Israel, still provides financial support to cash-strapped Jordan which amounts to $1.8 billion a year</p>
<p>For these reasons, Ryan expects that while there will be active and mobilised opposition within Jordan to any unilateral annexation, the anger is likely to be directed mostly at Israel and not so much focused on the Trump administration.</p>
<p>But according to Al-Makahleh, Jordan will not only look to the international arena but also coordinate a response with the Palestinian Authority (PA) to persuade Israel to reject annexation and return to the negotiations table. This move, however, could prove futile, according to Rogan, as the PA is isolated internationally with neither the US nor Israel engaging with it and the international community failing to provide support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unpopular domestically, accused of corruption and impotence and broken economically, unable to collect its own tax revenues and no longer willing to accept tax receipts from Israel,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Jordan has few options with which to stop annexation and responsibility will fall on the international community. But while European countries are weighing in, they too may be unable or unwilling to exert the required pressure.</p>
<p>The fate of Palestinians</p>
<p>Jordan&rsquo;s leadership has long warned of Israeli efforts to create &ldquo;an alternative homeland&rdquo; for Palestinians in Jordan. Any Israeli annexation of the Jordan Valley would only add to such concerns. Jordanians fear that annexation would also launch a new wave of refugees, at a time when the country is already struggling with Iraqi and Syrian refugees, not to mention the millions of Palestinians already living in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Israel must recognise the real consequences of annexation: if you keep the land, you keep the people,&rdquo; Rogan says. In this context, the current right-wing Israeli government would do well to realise the future damage annexation would cause, he adds, &ldquo;either by the isolation that comes to states that practice apartheid, or in losing the demographic majority that once made Israel a Jewish state.&rdquo;

<p>The Crusaders have produced a pair of wonderful tries in what has been an otherwise dull Super Rugby Aotearoa clash against the Chiefs in miserable conditions.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>In a match engulfed in handling errors, kicking duels and set pieces, the dynamic outside back duo joined forced to break the uninspiring theme of the game to bring the fixture to life with two expertly-taken tries.</p>
<p>The first of those came at the back end of the first half when a Richie Mo’unga bomb from inside his own half was misfielded by Chiefs fullback Damian McKenzie.</p>
<p>That allowed Reece to take the ball cleanly- a rare occurrence under the drizzly clouds of Christchurch – and set off down the right wing in the most exciting passage of play of the half.</p>
<p>Streaming down into the opposition’s 22, the All Blacks star simply had to draw in the covering Sean Wainui, which set free the supporting Jordan to run in his 11th try for the Crusaders in just his 14th outing.</p>
<p>The take, the offload from Sevu Reece &amp; the gas from Will Jordan. Just wow. ?: @skysportnz #CRUvCHI pic.twitter.com/V0DsqSaUKP — Super Rugby (@SuperRugbyNZ) June 28, 2020</p>
<p>The two players doubled down on their first half antics early in the second stanza, when Reece caught the Chiefs napping with a quick lineout near halfway while the visitors weren’t paying attention as they were in conversation with the referee.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>Warren Gatland’s men were made to pay for their lack of concentration, as Reece’s quick thinking sparked another scintillating attacking move against the run of play, of which was again easily capped off by Jordan.</p>
<p>The pair’s exploits have been widely lauded by pundits across Twitter, who mostly agree that their show of skill in difficult conditions and clever style of play have been the difference between the two sides at Orangetheory Stadium.</p>
<p>DMac misses the highball, Reese collects &amp; Jordan in for the try! From nowhere really but will that open the game up? Been low scoring wet game so far 10-3 35mins #CRUvCHI #SuperRugby — Paul from New Zealand Sport Radio (@DrivingMaul) June 28, 2020</p>

The second man charged is not associated with or from the Collingwood Football Club. &ldquo;Detectives from the Sexual Crimes Squad have charged two people in relation to a reported sexual assault,&rdquo; the statement read. &ldquo;Two 24-year-olds, one from Hampton East and one from Clematis, have both been charged with indecent assault and bailed to appear at Melbourne Magistrates' Court [on] 30 October. &ldquo;The charges are in relation to an incident, which is alleged to have occurred in Kew in 2015. As this matter is now before the court, police will not be making any further comment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The AFL in a statement said it provided &ldquo;education and ongoing counselling for all parties&rdquo; at the time of the 2018 probe. &ldquo;The AFL confirms in 2018 it was made aware of a matter involving Collingwood player Jordan De Goey from 2015,&rdquo; the statement read. &ldquo;As the legal process has now begun the AFL will make no further comment until it is completed.&rdquo; De Goey will not fly to Sydney to play against Hawthorn on Friday, but will go to WA the week after for Collingwood&rsquo;s next run of games. The AFL said De Goey could only rejoin Collingwood&rsquo;s football program after he clears two COVID-19 tests. A source with knowledge of the 2018 AFL and police investigations said they were carried out thoroughly, with multiple accounts listened to, and that they perceived the AFL and the club to have handled the matter well.</p>
<p>Loading St Kilda&rsquo;s Stephen Milne was allowed to play while facing rape charges from a 2004 incident. They were eventually dropped. North Melbourne&rsquo;s Majak Daw was also allowed to play while facing rape charges from a 2007 incident. He was found not guilty in 2015. De Goey will also face the Magistrates' Court in September after being caught driving while suspended and using his phone while driving. These are separate matters to the indecent assault charge. In other indiscretions, De Goey was caught driving with a blood alcohol reading of 0.095 while a P-plater. He was fined $10,000 and told to find employment outside the football club for four weeks.</p>
<p>Loading In 2017, Collingwood suspended De Goey for three matches and fined he $5000 after he broke his hand in a fight and lied about it to his club. De Goey originally said he was injured while playing with his dog. De Goey is currently without a manager but revealed on Thursday he was in talks with Collingwood for a new contract. He told the AFL Exchange podcast he saw his future in black and white. &ldquo;Yeah I do [want to stay at Collingwood long-term]. Obviously it&rsquo;s a fantastic club and they gave me the opportunity in the beginning, so I definitely want to stay there that&rsquo;s for sure,&rdquo; De Goey said.

<h3 id="from-victor-oladipo-to-deandre-jordan-eight-nba-players-sitting-out-of-disney-who-will-be-hardest-to-replace">&ldquo;From Victor Oladipo to DeAndre Jordan, eight NBA players sitting out of Disney who will be hardest to replace&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/07/04/c7c969c1-48f1-48a9-9939-50fef7394214/thumbnail/1200x675/3acba2c7cf5f7fa2155b5aee86d4e35c/oladipo.jpg" alt="img">
Watch Now: Will Role Players Struggle More Or Less In Orlando Bubble? ( 1:33 )</p>
<p>NBA teams normally have to worry about injuries or illness forcing players to the sidelines, but there&rsquo;s a new issue to contend with as the league&rsquo;s restart in Orlando looms. Several players, with possibly more on the way, have elected not to participate in the rest of the 2019-20 season for various reasons, ranging from health to social justice. The players have every right to make that choice, but it leaves their teams with questions about how to replace them.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we took a look at the players who have already opted out of competition in the bubble, and tried to figure out which players would be hardest and easiest to replace, statistically speaking. Since no single figure fully encapsulates a player&rsquo;s impact, we took the average of the player&rsquo;s rank in five stats designed to measure overall value: real plus-minus (RPM), box plus-minus (BPM), value over replacement player (VORP), win shares per 48 minutes (WS/48) and player efficiency rating (PER).</p>
<p>That left each player with an overall &ldquo;stat rank,&rdquo; which gives you an idea of where they stand in comparison to the rest of the NBA. With this method, reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo&rsquo;s stat rank would be 1.2, whereas a relatively average player like James Ennis would have a stat rank of 305.8. That should give you a little bit of context for what these numbers mean, and how difficult the players will be to replace for the rest of the season. For good measure, we also looked at the team&rsquo;s net rating with that player on and off the court this season.</p>
<p>*Stat rank averages RPM, BPM, VORP, WS/48, and PER</p>
<p>Wilson Chandler BKN • SF • 21 PPG 5.9 RPG 4.1 BPG .3 View Profile</p>
<p>Stat rank: 395.4</p>
<p>395.4 On/Off net rating: minus-7.6</p>
<p>On the surface it may seem like losing a wing playing over 20 minutes per game would be a harsh blow to the Nets, but Chandler has been pretty ineffective in his 35 games this season following a PED suspension to start the year. Brooklyn has been 7.6 points worse than their opponents per 100 possessions with Chandler on the court this season, so they might actually be better off divvying up his minutes among their other wings. This will also allow Nets coach Jacque Vaughn get more minutes out of the lineup of Spencer Dinwiddie (if he goes), Joe Harris, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Garrett Temple, which has a plus-11.6 net rating this season in 208 minutes.</p>
<p>Avery Bradley LAL • PG • 11 PPG 8.6 APG 1.3 SPG .9 3P/G 1.286 View Profile</p>
<p>Stat rank: 312.6</p>
<p>312.6 On/Off net rating: plus-0.8</p>
<p>This is where stats seems to come up a bit short of contribution, as most would agree that Bradley opting out is a significant loss for the Lakers. The question is whether they can break even by giving his minutes to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Alex Caruso and newly signed JR Smith. Bradley helps the Lakers positionally by defending opposing guards, which allows LeBron James to assume point guard duties on offense, and the team has been better defensively with Bradley on the court. The stats indicate Bradley&rsquo;s absence won&rsquo;t sway the Lakers' title hopes one way or another, but given his playoff experience and basketball IQ, they&rsquo;d certainly rather have him out there.</p>
<p>Victor Oladipo IND • SG • 4 PPG 13.8 APG 3.0 SPG .8 3P/G 1.615 View Profile</p>
<p>Stat rank: 308.4</p>
<p>308.4 On/Off net rating: minus-2.6</p>
<p>Oladipo is perhaps the biggest name player to opt out thus far, and his case is a puzzling one. On one hand, he would have been more than capable of making a huge difference in the Pacers' postseason. On the other hand, the evidence over the course of his 13 games with the team suggested he&rsquo;s still far from being the All-Star fans have come to know and love in Indiana. Oladipo was clearly improving, but the Pacers were worse with him on the court and there&rsquo;s no telling whether he would have improved enough by the start of the playoffs to make a significant impact. Unfortunately, we won&rsquo;t get the chance to find out, and the Pacers &ndash; already thin in the backcourt after the loss of Jeremy Lamb &ndash; will have to lean on Justin Holiday and Doug McDermott to fill those wing minutes, with players like T.J. McConnell, Aaron Holiday and Edmond Sumner likely getting more run.</p>
<p>Thabo Sefolosha HOU • SF • 18 PPG 2.2 RPG 2.3 BPG .3 View Profile</p>
<p>Stat rank: 292.4</p>
<p>292.4 On/Off net rating: plus-0.6</p>
<p>A veteran defender, Sefolosha played just over 10 minutes per game for the Rockets this season and didn&rsquo;t see the court in six of the team&rsquo;s final seven games before the hiatus in March. He wasn&rsquo;t a huge factor for the Rockets, even in their small-ball configurations, and they&rsquo;ve already replaced him with Luc Mbah a Moute, whom our James Herbert says can make a huge impact on Houston&rsquo;s defense despite not having played in an NBA game since October of 2018. It&rsquo;s possible that the Rockets have actually upgraded by Sefolosha choosing to sit out.</p>
<p>Trevor Ariza POR • SG • 8 PPG 8.0 APG 1.7 SPG 1.3 3P/G 1.453 View Profile</p>
<p>Stat rank: 219.2</p>
<p>219.2 On/Off net rating (with Blazers): plus-8</p>
<p>Ariza&rsquo;s stat rank is skewed since he played half the season in Sacramento, where he was dreadful offensively. Since joining Portland in January, however, he&rsquo;s been a key part of Portland&rsquo;s thin wing rotation, so losing him makes the Blazers' path to the postseason in Orlando that much harder. The Blazers were a plus-8 with Ariza on the court this season, and he was essential to one of the team&rsquo;s best lineups (plus-5.6 net rating in 230 minutes) alongside Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside. Perhaps the worst part for the Blazers is that, already without Rodney Hood, they&rsquo;ll be forced to play wings like Gary Trent Jr. and Nassir Little, who have not been great and don&rsquo;t have a modicum of the playoff experience that Ariza possesses.</p>
<p>Stat rank: 135.8</p>
<p>135.8 On/Off net rating (with Mavericks): minus-1.1</p>
<p>Cauley-Stein&rsquo;s advanced metrics are pretty good, but that&rsquo;s largely from his time playing a prominent role with the Warriors this season. Since joining Dallas he&rsquo;s been in and out of the rotation, so his impact in Orlando likely would have been minimal. That being said, without Dwight Powell certain matchups will present a problem for the Mavericks, and it would have been nice to at least have the option of throwing Cauley-Stein out there for 8-10 minutes here and there to be a lob threat and rim-runner. As it stands, they&rsquo;ll probably lean heavily on lineups with Kristaps Porzingis at center, which have been incredibly effective this season. So overall, not much of a loss here for the Mavs.</p>
<p>Stat rank: 115.6</p>
<p>115.6 On/Off net rating: plus-7.3</p>
<p>The Wizards were equally terrible defensively with or without Bertans on the floor this season, but they turned into an offensive juggernaut during his minutes, scoring 113.6 points per 100 possessions. Due to the volume and efficiency of his 3-point marksmanship, Bertans is ranked 23rd in ESPN&rsquo;s real plus-minus, just ahead of All-Stars Rudy Gobert, Pascal Siakam and Jayson Tatum. The other advanced stats aren&rsquo;t quite as friendly toward Bertans, but there&rsquo;s absolutely no doubt that he is the most important player on the Wizards roster not named Bradley Beal. Without Bertans, the Wizards' slim hopes of making the postseason dwindle even further.</p>
<p>DeAndre Jordan BKN • C • 6 PPG 8.3 RPG 10.0 BPG .9 View Profile</p>
<p>Stat rank: 81.8</p>
<p>81.8 On/Off net rating: minus-1.5</p>
<p>It may be slightly surprising that statistically Jordan is the most impactful player to opt out of Orlando so far &ndash; whether you agree with those stats is up to you. Jordan is in the top 60 this season in BPM, VORP, PER and WS/48, but falls all the way to 214th in real plus-minus, which seems like quite an outlier. The higher rankings are somewhat perplexing, however, when you see that the Nets have actually been 1.5 points per 100 possessions worse with Jordan on the court. He entered the starting lineup for the final two games before the shutdown &ndash; both wins &ndash; so the Nets have essentially lost their first-string center. Jordan was also a part of one of the team&rsquo;s best lineups this season (plus-13.1 in 86 minutes), with Dinwiddie, Harris, Prince and Garrett Temple. Jarrett Allen will have to absorb more minutes, with more small-ball lineups likely on the way for Brooklyn.

NZ Rugby needs to be less dependent on the All Blacks for the business to survive, rugby writer tells the Detail.</p>
<p>OPINION: The Crusaders' outside backs quickly shook off any rust against the Hurricanes on Sunday.</p>
<p>All Black Sevu Reece produce his liveliest display of the year in their first game of Super Rugby Aotearoa, while George Bridge was busy on the other flank.</p>
<p>Masanori Udagawa/Getty-Images Will Jordan&rsquo;s incisive running caused the Hurricanes plenty of problems at Sky Stadium on Sunday.</p>
<p>However, fullback Will Jordan was the pick of the bunch.</p>
<p>Playing in his preferred position, the No 15 was a menace on the counterattack and sliced through the middle of the Hurricanes defence a few times on his way to collecting more than 100 running metres.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>High penalty counts continue to rob sides of attacking momentum, but Jordan still managed to stand out.</p>
<p>Beauden Barrett continues to settle in nicely at the Blues, but Jordan&rsquo;s incisive running from the back was too good to ignore in this week&rsquo;s Team of the Week.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>
<p>Will Jordan (Crusaders): The champions are spoilt for choice in the back three and Jordan may get more opportunities if David Havili is needed in the midfield to replace Braydon Ennor (hamstring).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sevu Reece (Crusaders): Scored a brilliant early try, and marked up well against big Ben Lam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quinn Tupaea (Chiefs): Highly promising young midfielder continued his strong start to Super Rugby Aotearoa with some good carries and excellent tackles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jack Goodhue (Crusaders): Spent 10 minutes in the naughty chair but was otherwise very solid after starting the game at No 12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caleb Clarke (Blues): Few opportunities when he did get some space he looked like a million dollars. Also defended well against the slippery Shaun Stevenson.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hagen Hopkins/Getty-Images Richie Mo&rsquo;unga prepares to pounce on Mitchell Drummond&rsquo;s pass against the Hurricanes.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>Richie Mo&rsquo;unga (Crusaders): Grabbed a 19-point haul and scored the game&rsquo;s decisive try after taking Mitchell Drummond&rsquo;s miracle pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TJ Perenara (Hurricanes): Much sharper game than a week earlier against the Blues. Made some good running metres, and played a big part in Asafo Aumua&rsquo;s try.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hoskins Sotutu (Blues): All-round game came to the fore against the Chiefs, and the drums will continue to beat for an All Blacks call-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dalton Papali&rsquo;i (Blues): Copped a &lsquo;team&rsquo; yellow card late in the first half (and probably deserved it, too) but was otherwise strong as Blues edged the breakdown battle after sorting out their discipline at halftime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cullen Grace (Crusaders): Beats Akira Ioane by a whisker but there was little between the pair, with both putting in plenty of dirty work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Josh Goodhue (Blues): It&rsquo;s taken the other Goodhue twin a while to grow into his big frame, but he&rsquo;s now finding some consistency at Super Rugby level and complements Tuipulotu nicely.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fiona Goodall/Getty-Images Blues captain Patrick Tuipulotu barges past the Chiefs on Saturday.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Patrick Tuipulotu (Blues): The form lock in New Zealand led from the front, scattering defenders with some rampaging runs in the second half when it counted most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Alaalatoa (Crusaders): Hard-working Samoa prop might never be Owen Franks at scrum time, but has developed into highly reliable performer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codie Taylor (Crusaders): Won his duel with Dane Coles but the All Blacks must be hoping that a young hooker puts up his hand in the coming months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe Moody (Crusaders): Made some strong carries but won&rsquo;t be entirely happy with being penalised for collapsing the scrum against Tyrel Lomax in the first half.

<p>Jordan left Peri devastated when he brutally dumped her last month after moving into their family home because he needed a place to stay.</p>
<p>With Leela unaware of what went on between them, he quickly turned his attention to her - under the promise of keeping their romance a secret.</p>
<p>However, a recent Hollyoaks episode saw cruel Jordan tell Peri that he still had feelings for her in a desperate bid to stop her from telling her mum about a stash of his drugs that she discovered.</p>
<p>She ended up sleeping with her former flame - unaware that he is also sleeping with her mother, Leela, in secret.</p>
