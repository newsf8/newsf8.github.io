<p>This past April, a star-studded concert was announced to celebrate Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim&rsquo;s 90th birthday. The lineup included Meryl Streep, Mandy Patinkin, Audra McDonald and Bernadette Peters. It did not include actress and singer Linda Lavin.</p>
<p>So, she went online, writing: &ldquo;This is very exciting!! I&rsquo;m wondering if you&rsquo;d like me to sing &lsquo;The Boy From…&rdquo; from &lsquo;The Mad Show&rsquo;?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s Linda Lavin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>datalounge.com</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that moment, what I really wanted to say was: &lsquo;Why the hell am I not on that show?'&rdquo; Lavin told correspondent Mo Rocca. &ldquo;So, I tried to say it in a more gracious way. And they called!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lavin ended up singing a comedic Sondheim number she first sang back in 1966.</p>
<p>Rocca asked, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just put it this way: you&rsquo;re willing to advocate for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to advocate for myself, absolutely,&rsquo; Lavin replied. &ldquo;Sometimes people don&rsquo;t think of you. They don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re here. I&rsquo;m still here! They don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re alive! You gotta let &lsquo;em know, gotta let &lsquo;em know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s alive, all right. It&rsquo;s been 35 years since Lavin ended her run as TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s been hustling ever since, starring on Broadway, where she won a Tony (for &ldquo;Broadway Bound&rdquo;), and on shows like &ldquo;Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the pandemic set in, she began doing weekly concerts from her Manhattan living room, with pianist Billy Stritch.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s even released a new album, &ldquo;Love Notes.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked more in these 2½ months than I have in 2½ years. I&rsquo;m not making that up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Growing up in Portland, Maine, music was always a part of Lavin&rsquo;s life. Her mother, Lucille, sang opera: &ldquo;She sang on the radio and early television. She sang with George Gershwin. But in those years, doctors would say to women who were career women, &lsquo;If you want to have a baby, you have to give up your career.&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s what my generation comes from, those women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your mother give up her career when she was expecting you?&rdquo; Rocca asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lavin said her mother always encouraged her to sing: &ldquo;My mother also tells the story that I stood up – I hadn&rsquo;t spoken yet – and that one night there was company. And I stood up in my crib and sang &lsquo;God Bless America.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>For her seventh birthday, she and her girlfriends made a fateful trip to the movies, to the film &ldquo;Cover Girl,&rdquo; starring Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. &ldquo;And I remember it as if it were yesterday,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Rita Hayworth came down a ramp. She was floating in all chiffon. And I knew right then that that&rsquo;s who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a concession to her parents, she went to college (William &amp; Mary). Right after graduation, she moved to New York, where she went right to work at Bloomingdales, in the handkerchief department. &ldquo;The least-visited department,&rsquo; she said. &ldquo;Lived on a dollar a day. I&rsquo;m not making that up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lavin found work in plays and musicals, and in 1973 she headed West, and eventually to sitcom stardom.</p>
<p>For nine seasons, Lavin played single mother Alice Hyatt, hoping to make it as a singer, but getting by as a waitress at a Phoenix diner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And working for equal pay, equal rights,&rdquo; Lavin said. &ldquo;She politicized me. The role had a huge effect on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WEB EXTRA VIDEO: Linda Lavin on her politicization thanks to &ldquo;Alice&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Lavin soon became an unofficial spokesperson for single working moms: &ldquo;And I decided the best way to do it was to wear my Alice uniform and just show up as Alice, &lsquo;cause people knew who she was, and they knew what she stood for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Linda Lavin is 82 now. When she&rsquo;s not working, she&rsquo;s spending time with her dog Mickey and her husband, artist and musician Steve Bakunas. The couple met in 1999.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprised the hell outta me,&rdquo; Lavin said.</p>
<p>Because? &ldquo;I had no interest in another romance or marriage. I didn&rsquo;t think I was very good at relationships. And I found out that it takes work, and I&rsquo;m willing to do the work, and so is he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody said to me: &lsquo;Wear life like a loose garment, Linda. Lighten up!&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>Bakunas was in Costa Rica when the pandemic started, so for months the two have been Facetiming nightly.</p>
<p>But, can we just get back to &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; for a minute? Lavin sang the show&rsquo;s theme song (one of this correspondent&rsquo;s all-time favorites), and with different endings. &ldquo;Every season we tried a different way with it, you know?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Rocca asked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know: Do you prefer &lsquo;Bah-bah-buh-bah-bom&rsquo; or &lsquo;Suuu-weet&rsquo;? I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know which side you land on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought –&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;OK, then I&rsquo;ll say I prefer &lsquo;Bah-bah-buh-bah-bom&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="cape-cod-arts-playhouse-goes-outdoors-other-groups-go-virtual">&ldquo;Cape Cod arts: Playhouse goes outdoors, other groups go virtual&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.capecodtimes.com/storyimage/CC/20200802/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/200809947/AR/0/AR-200809947.jpg" alt="img">
Cape Playhouse begins outdoor lectures and concerts; Provincetown Theater honors Charles Busch; and more news.</p>
<p>Authors, history, an Olympic skater, local rockabilly, classic music and Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>Patrons can’t go inside the Cape Playhouse this summer, so officials there are delivering a variety of August entertainment outside.</p>
<p>Beyond the Popcorn Pop-Up Drive-In movies in the parking lot on Wednesday nights through Aug. 19, the playhouse next week opens an outdoor stage for an “On the Green” program of weekly lectures and concerts at its 820 Route 6A location in Dennis.</p>
<p>Each 90-minute, no-intermission event — limited to 100 attendees, with masks and social distancing required — will begin at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $20. The lawn will open at 6 p.m. each night for picnicking, with nearby restaurants ready for takeout.</p>
<p>The Thursday-evening “Mass Roots” speaker series set up by producing artistic director Michael Rader starts Aug. 6 with “The Kennedy Legacy on Cape Cod,” a panel discussion featuring Pulitzer Prize-winning author Fredrik Logevall, a professor of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School who is writing a Kennedy biography; Alan Price, director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston; author Larry Tye (“Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon”); and moderator Dick Neitz (a member of the board of directors at the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum and former president of its foundation).</p>
<p>There are no Olympics this summer, but skater Nancy Kerrigan will speak Aug. 13 about her journey from childhood ice-skating lessons to two Olympic medals. Kerrigan, who formerly practiced at the Tony Kent Arena in South Dennis, is now working on a documentary about eating disorders in competitive sports.</p>
<p>The Aug. 20 talk will be by authors Casey Sherman (a Hyannis native) and Dave Wedge, whose most recent collaboration was “Hunting Whitey,” the story of the capture and death of notorious Boston mob boss James “Whitey” Bulger. The two also authored “Boston Strong,” adapted for the Mark Wahlberg movie “Patriots Day”; and sports books on the quarterback Tom Brady and Pete Frates and the Ice Bucket Challenge.</p>
<p>On Aug. 27 will be the interactive storytelling event The Mosquito Story Slam. Audience members are invited to prepare five-minute, true stories based on the theme “Suddenly Last Summer.” Ten storytellers will be chosen.</p>
<p>The Friday-night “Eat to the Beat” concerts will feature: Aug. 7 (with an extra show on Aug. 8), area rockabilly band Sarah Swain and the Oh Boys with guest Bruce Maclean; Aug. 14, the Cape Cod Jazz Quintet; Aug. 21, the Quartett Giocosa, composed of musicians from The Cape Symphony; and Aug. 28, “A Night of Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins,” which will feature James Barry and Scott Moreau, two actors from the Broadway national tour of “Million Dollar Quartet.”</p>
<p>Provincetown Theater to honor Charles Busch</p>
<p>Provincetown Theater’s Provincetown American Playwright Award (PAPA) will be presented — virtually — on Aug. 15 to Charles Busch, a writer whom artistic director David Drake described as a “trailblazing, gender-bending legend.”</p>
<p>Bush’s credits include “The Divine Sister,” “Psycho Beach Party,” “The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife,” “Die, Mommie, Die!,” and long-running off-Broadway comedy “Vampire Lesbians of Sodom.”</p>
<p>The half-hour show will stream for free at 5:30 p.m. on provincetowntheater.org and will include tributes from Linda Lavin, Taylor Mac, Jinkx Monsoon, Michelle Lee, Daryl Roth and more. The award ceremony is typically a fundraiser, Drake said, so he is encouraging fans to host their own house parties and he welcomes donations to the theater.</p>
<p>The virtual party will be hosted by Ken Fulk and James Wootton, who typically host the in-person awards night. Fulk recently had the historic Mary Heaton Vorse House, important to the birth of the Provincetown Players, restored and Drake plans a virtual tour of the house as part of the Aug. 15 presentation.</p>
<p>To start the theater’s new Stephen Mindich Literary Project, the theater will collaborate with the Provincetown Arts Society on the Paula Vogel Playwright Residency program, and the writer will stay at the Mary Heaton Vorse House.</p>
<p>National collaboration includes Nantucket theater</p>
<p>Current theater shutdowns have stopped live theater, but have allowed collaborations that can only take place in the virtual world.</p>
<p>Theatre Workshop of Nantucket is among 13 theater companies, 12 directors (including artistic director Justin Cerne) and 109 actors who have been working together to present a digital version of Caryl Churchill&rsquo;s “Love and Information.” The 57 short scenes range from seconds to minutes in length to create a 120-minute whole.</p>
<p>The result may be streamed for 24 hours starting at 2 p.m. Wednesday, and again for a 24-hour block from the same time on Aug. 12 and 19. Watching is free, though donations to TWN and other theaters are welcome.</p>
<p>“Normally this level of collaboration would be impossible on many levels,” notes the Nantucket company’s website. “However, in this moment it is not only possible, but appropriate and fitting.”</p>
<p>To watch: <a href="https://theatrenantucket.org/shows/love-and-information/">https://theatrenantucket.org/shows/love-and-information/</a>.</p>
<p>More cultural online programs coming</p>
<p>The Cultural Center of Cape Cod has received $22,000 in new funding to use for equipment and software for the Enhanced Access to Education Project, part of the Keep Cape Cod Creative initiative it launched as a result of the COVID-19 shutdown.</p>
<p>The plan, said executive director Robert Nash in an announcement, is to “create a robust, diverse, affordable and accessible online curriculum,” including online classes, workshops, lectures, gallery tours, readings, demonstrations and other presentations.</p>
<p>The project is especially aimed at at-risk youth and other populations that “lack the means” to use in-person educational opportunities. The curriculum will be useful at all times, but particularly when face-to-face meetings are restricted, he said.</p>
<p>Money was donated by individuals, The Edward Bangs Kelley and Elza Kelley Foundation, and the Eastern Bank Charitable Foundation.</p>
<p>The center has already hosted more than 100 online classes since March and is working to expand the programming. Information: <a href="http://www.cultural-center.org">www.cultural-center.org</a>, 508-394-7100 or <a href="mailto:aneill@cultural-center.org">aneill@cultural-center.org</a>.</p>

In the News: Billy Porter and Jennifer Hudson Will Sing in CBS&rsquo; John Lewis Tribute, Provincetown Theater to Honor Charles Busch, More</p>
<p>Et Alia, a femme-fronted and -focused arts alliance, launches July 31.</p>
<p>CBS will honor the enduring legacy of the late Rep. John Lewis August 4 at 10 PM with John Lewis: Celebrating a Hero. Hosted by Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Gayle King, and Brad Pitt, the special will take viewers on a journey into Lewis’ remarkable life, his work, and the principles that guided him: wisdom, courage, power, faith, and inspiration. Featuring performances and interviews that celebrate and honor Lewis’ contributions to the country, artists taking part include Tony winner Billy Porter, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, Yolanda Adams, Jon Batiste, Common, John Legend, Trevor Noah, and Wynonna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift Every Voice and Sing,&rdquo; James Weldon and J. Rosamond Johnson&rsquo;s song from the CB Murray musical Pearl—based on the life of Pearl Bailey—has been reimagined to support the Black Lives Matter Movement. Murray wrote and produced a video—with the help and support of Kecia Lewis, Jennie Harney-Fleming, DeWitt Fleming Jr., Tony winner Ben Harney, Thaddeus McCants, and Charles Czernecki—featuring the uplifting tune. Watch it here.</p>
<p>Provincetown Theater will present the third annual Provincetown American Playwright Award August 15 to Tony-nominated playwright Charles Busch (The Tale of the Allergist&rsquo;s Wife, The Divine Sister). Initiated by the theatre in 2018, the award is given to an American playwright whose work has long enriched, empowered, and expanded the depth and scope of the American experience on the world stage. Busch will be presented the award by last year’s recipient, Pulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel. The virtual benefit, which begins at 5:30 PM ET, will be hosted by interior designer Ken Fulk and his husband Kurt Wootton, and will include a congratulatory line-up from such friends and colleagues as Linda Lavin, Michele Lee, Julie Halston, Alison Fraser, Jennifer Van Dyck, Taylor Mac, Ryan Landry, Daryl Roth, and Jinkx Monsoon. Virtual attendees can also expect a video walking tour of Fulk’s refurbishment of the historic Mary Heaton Vorse house in Provincetown. Visit ProvincetownTheater.org.</p>
<p>Et Alia, a femme-fronted and -focused arts alliance, launches July 31, offering free workshops, educational resources, and a virtual coworking community for female, femme, and non-binary artists. Initial offerings include a weekly writing cohort and weekly educative articles written by female and non-binary artists comprised of actors, writers, producers, musicians, and filmmakers of diverse backgrounds and experiences. Free online courses will follow in the fall, focusing on independent filmmaking, technical theatre, website building and graphic design, and audition prep. Visit EtAliaLLC.com.</p>
<p>Theater Breaking Through Barriers&rsquo; second Virtual Playmakers&rsquo; Intensive: Voices From the Great Experiment, scheduled for August 3–10, will feature eight original plays created by playwrights Fareeda Ahmed, Enrique Huili, Khalil LeSaldo, Monèt Noelle Marshall, Chris Phillips, Tatiana G. Rivera, Christopher Chan Roberson, and Jeff Tabnick. Rehearsed entirely on Zoom, there are two ways to stream—on YouTube nightly at 7:30 PM and on Facebook at 8:15 PM.</p>
<p>And, the film world has lost one of its most accomplished directors, Alan Parker, the two-time Oscar nominee whose films won 10 Academy Awards. Parker, whose movies included Midnight Express, The Commitments, and Fame, died July 31 in London at the age of 76 following a long illness. Also a three-time Golden Globe nominee, Parker is probably best known to theatre fans for his direction of the 1996 film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&rsquo;s Evita, which co-starred Madonna, Jonathan Pryce, and Antonio Banderas. Parker not only directed the movie musical, but he shared a screenwriting credit with librettist Rice and Oliver Stone. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning for Best Original Song, Lloyd Webber and Rice&rsquo;s &ldquo;You Must Love Me.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://wellfleet.wickedlocal.com/storyimage/WL/20200801/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/200809830/AR/0/AR-200809830.jpg" alt="img">
At a virtual gala on Aug. 15, Busch will receive the annual Provincetown American Playwright Award, known as PAPA. Pulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel will present Busch with the award.</p>
<p>PROVINCETOWN — At a virtual gala on Aug. 15, Charles Busch will receive Provincetown Theater’s annual Provincetown American Playwright Award, known as PAPA. Pulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel will present Busch with the 2020 PAPA</p>
<p>The board and artistic director of the Provincetown Theater are proud to announce the third annual award to the trailblazing, gender-bending playwright Charles Busch for his outstanding contributions to the American Theater. Initiated by the Provincetown Theater in 2018, the PAPA is given to an American playwright whose work has long enriched, empowered, and expanded the depth and scope of the American experience on the world stage.</p>
<p>States Mr. Busch, “I am extremely honored to be the third recipient of the PAPA and to follow my two great colleagues, Terrence McNally and Paula Vogel. My breakthrough play Vampire Lesbians of Sodom played at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York’s Greenwich Village, which was founded by original Provincetown Players Eugene O&rsquo;Neill and Susan Glaspell after their apprenticeship in Provincetown. So I am very touched by the symmetry of receiving this award by the Provincetown Theater.”</p>
<p>Scheduled to receive his award in a 30-minute virtual online “show” on August 15, starting at 5:30 p.m., the mastermind is behind such hits as The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife, Psycho Beach Party, The Divine Sister, Die Mommie Die, and the longest-running comedy in off-Broadway history Vampire Lesbians of Sodom.</p>
<p>The virtual benefit, hosted by internationally acclaimed interior designer Ken Fulk and his husband Kurt Wootton, will also include a star-studded congratulatory line-up from such friends and colleagues of Mr. Busch as Linda Lavin, Michele Lee, Julie Halston, Alison Fraser, Jennifer Van Dyck, Taylor Mac, Ryan Landry, Daryl Roth, and Jinkx Monsoon, to name but a few. Also a highlight during the virtual PAPA show will be a video walking tour of Mr. Fulk’s dramatic refurbishment of the historic Mary Heaton Vorse house in Provincetown, MA. Longtime home to the legendary writer of “Time and the Town,” Mr. Fulk has recreated the 18th century residence into a new creative working space for such non-profits as the Provincetown Theater, Provincetown Art Association and Museum, Provincetown Film Society, and Twenty Summers.</p>
<p>As the PAPA award celebration is also a major annual fundraising event for the Provincetown Theater, more information and details on how to pledge support and participate in the 2020 PAPA “House Party” please visit provincetowntheater.org. For frequent updates on the Theater, please follow us on Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>As background, Charles Busch has forged a unique place in the world of entertainment as playwright, actor, and drag icon. He is the author and star of over twenty-five plays including The Divine Sister, The Lady in Question, Red Scare on Sunset, The Tribute Artist and Vampire Lesbians of Sodom. His play The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife ran for 777 performances on Broadway, won the Outer Circle Critics’ John L. Gassner Award for playwriting, received a Tony nomination for Best Play, and is the longest running Broadway comedy of the past twenty-five years. With his most recent play, The Confession of Lily Dare, Busch received a 2020 Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Best Actor.</p>
<p>For the movies, Busch wrote and starred in the film versions of his plays, Psycho Beach Party and Die Mommie Die, the latter for which he won the Best Performance Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Additional honors include two MAC awards, a special Drama Desk Award for career achievement, and a star on the Playwrights Walk outside the legendary Lucille Lortel Theatre in Greenwich Village, NYC.</p>
<p>The Provincetown Theater is owned and managed by the Provincetown Theater Foundation (PTF). A 501c3 not-for-profit performing arts center, the Provincetown Theater produces plays, musicals, readings, and other performance events year-round on Outer Cape Cod in Provincetown, MA.
