Namoora Haiklu actress Sarah Annaiah, who had moved to the small screen with the Tamil soap opera Malar, is now coming to Kannada TV. The actress, we hear, has been signed up for Kannadathi , which has Kiran Raj and Ranjani Raghavan in the lead. “While I would have loved to start my small screen tryst with a Kannada serial, the opportunity first came from Tamil. I am glad that I have been offered a role in Kannadathi; better late than never, right?” she says.In Kannadathi, Sarah will play Varudhini, a wedding planner who hails from an affluent family. “Interestingly, my character also has a negative shade, which will be revealed later on in the narrative. Varudhini is a straightforward girl, who comes across as rather rude, but manages to justify her behaviour. The extent to which she goes about planning things to make sure she gets what she wants will intrigue viewers,” says the actress, who adds that she is set to sign up for another Kannada film as well and that she is looking at balancing careers on the big and small screen.
