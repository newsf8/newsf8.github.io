<p>Pearl Jam fans, rejoice: the Seattle-based grunge band has finally released its 11th and latest studio album, Gigaton.</p>
<p>Serving as the follow-up to 2013’s Lightning Bolt, the long-awaited record was released March 27 across all platforms, in digital and physical formats, through both Republic Records and Pearl Jam’s own independent label, Monkeywrench.</p>
<p>Alongside the band’s longstanding members — frontman Eddie Vedder, guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready, bassist Jeff Ament and drummer Matt Cameron — Gigaton was produced by music engineer Josh Evans (Soundgarden).</p>
<p>Not only does the 57-minute body of work include the three singles — Dance of the Clairvoyants, Superblood Wolfmoon and Quick Escape — as well as 9 other brand new, previously unheard tracks, but it’s a vessel for some of Pearl Jam’s most diverse and complex offerings to date.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>In celebration of its release, here are some things we learned on our first few listens of Gigaton:</p>
<p>What’s the story behind the album artwork?</p>
<p>For those who may not know, the album artwork is actually a photograph named “Ice Waterfall” taken by Canadian photographer and marine biologist Paul Nicklen. The image was captured in Svalbard, Norway, sometime in 2014.</p>
<p>So why did they pick that specific image? Well, the album title correlates with it. A “gigaton” equates to 1 billion metric tons and is also the measurement used to determine the continuous melting of polar ice caps across the world.</p>
<p>1:05 Pearl Jam postpones first leg of upcoming tour over coronavirus fears Pearl Jam postpones first leg of upcoming tour over coronavirus fears</p>
<p>It’s particularly relevant because the inevitable doom of the Earth is one of the many topics explored in Gigaton.</p>
<p>Describing the picture, Nicklen wrote: “Even though this was taken just 600 miles from the North Pole the temperature was in the high 60’s. The Arctic could be completely devoid of sea ice during the summer months in the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>“This striking scene is a reminder of the fragility of this icy ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Paul Nicklen\’s \’Ice Waterfall\’ also serves as the artwork for Pearl Jam\’s eleventh studio album, \’Gigaton\’ (2020). Paul Nicklen / Universal</p>
<p>Is Gigaton a concept album, then?</p>
<p>There’s no specific concept.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Sure, the artwork alone forces us to look at the state of the environment. Yes, the musical elements are mostly brooding and indignant. But there’s an array of other concepts to digest, too. The anger and darkness contained within Gigaton is frequently deferred by Vedder’s particularly hopeful lyrics.</p>
<p>Throughout, he offers the listener a sense of solace in (non-specific) times of crisis — which seems especially relevant in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>As opposed to the rest of the album’s mature nature, Comes Then Goes sticks out like a sore thumb in the sense that it’s pouring with emotion. It acts as an almost-tribute to one of Vedder’s fallen comrades. Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, perhaps? Maybe, but it’s never explicitly said.</p>
<p>In the melancholy tune, Vedder, 55, sings: “High or low, where’d you go / Are you stuck in the middle? / A spectral invisible ghost / I’m here juxtaposed / Like images of angels in the snow.”</p>
<p>Cornell and Vedder, along with the rest of Pearl Jam, were part of the Temple of the Dog together decades ago and all close friends. Cameron, 57, also served as Soundgarden’s drummer — the band Cornell fronted.</p>
<p>There are even a few political references</p>
<p>While Gigaton is in no way politically charged as a whole, there are a few angry lines aimed towards U.S. President Donald Trump — in songs like River Cross and Seven O’Clock.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>In the latter, Vedder references the legendary Hunkpapa Lakota leader Sitting Bull, calling Trump, 73, “Sitting Bulls–t” instead, “our own sitting president.”</p>
<p>With the album being the quintet’s first, and possibly last, full-bodied offering during the Trump administration, the critiques seem appropriate. Though elusive, Vedder’s jabs against the Republican leader are both humourous and effective.</p>
<p>“The lengths we had to go to then / To find a place Trump hadn’t f–ked up yet,” Vedder sings in the less-than-subtle Quick Escape; which covers the story of an environmentally doomed planet, simultaneously serving as one of the songs calling back to the album’s environmental arc.</p>

<p>Gigaton feels really short</p>
<p>With a nearly hour-long timespan, Gigaton is on the lengthier side in terms of modern-day rock albums. It’s jam-packed with enough intricacies that it diminishes the fear some might have that it will be an intimidating or gruelling body of work to listen to. On the contrary, it actually zooms by.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>In fact, if you don’t focus on the album, you’re likely to miss out on a lot of the hidden gems contained within it — especially upon first listen.</p>
<p>Like it or not, this is one of many reasons why Gigaton should be heard front-to-back and certainly more than Once (ha). The variety of sounds backs that point up as well.</p>
<p>It’s the band’s most experimental release to date</p>
<p>Gigaton is comparable to Vitalogy (1993) in the sense that it goes here, there and everywhere. Sure there’s a lot to digest, but the diversity works in favour of the album — especially for already diehard Pearl Jam fans.</p>
<p>While it bounces between different musical genres and a sundry of sonic elements spanning the band’s extensive back catalogue — and not just the albums from their heyday — it’s enjoyable and remarkably easy to ingest.</p>
<p>From the much-beloved Yield (1998) to the highly-condemned Riot Act (2002), or even 2009’s often-overlooked Backspacer, the band seems to have taken a piece from each of their albums to make Gigaton.</p>
<p>Pearl Jam, 2020. Danny Clinch / Universal Music Group</p>
<p>Josh Evans’ production work is essential to the album</p>
<p>Compared to the last few albums, Evans’ grittier and raw production work is utilized to perfection throughout.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Though it’s not as refined or crisp as Lightning Bolt, which many considered to be a hit-or-miss record, Gigaton wields a much fuller sound than most other Pearl Jam releases.</p>
<p>This is a blessing in itself as it beautifully highlights the overall experimentation and instrumental assortment found throughout the album, specifically with songs like Dance of the Clairvoyants, Alright, Seven O’Clock and River Cross — the epic and sombre grand finale.</p>

<p>There’s something for everyone</p>
<p>While the overlying maturity of themes contained within Gigaton show the band is continuing to both develop as a unit and stray from the relative simplicity of their 1990’s grunge-era roots, there’s still a healthy package of tracks within it to help longtime fans reminisce on their glory days.</p>
<p>Equipped with an abundance of rapidly-paced rock bangers like Who Ever Said, Superblood Wolfmoon, Quick Escape, Never Destination and Take the Long Way, there should be enough to keep nostalgia-based fans satisfied.</p>
<p>Gigaton, as a whole, is quite notably acoustic-heavy; especially towards the end. Songs like Buckle Up, Come Then Goes and Retrograde stick out among these in particular, shadowing the likes of Oceans and Release from their debut album, Ten (1991).</p>

<p>With the help of 12-string guitars, funky guitar riffs, gripping solos and Vedder’s vocal contributions, Gigaton triumphs above most other modern rock albums.</p>

<p>What does the band think?</p>
<p>About the creation of Gigaton, McCready, 53, said: “Making this record was a long journey. It was emotionally dark and confusing at times, but also an exciting and experimental road map to musical redemption.”</p>
<p>“[It] ultimately gave me greater love, awareness and knowledge of the need for human connection in these times,” added the guitarist.</p>
<p>Ament, 57, admitted that the seven year-spanning break “benefited” the band, helping them take “more chances.</p>
<p>“We’ve opened some new doors creatively and that’s exciting,” said the bassist.</p>

<p>It’s not only a comeback for the band, but a rebirth in a way. It’s dynamic, it’s complex and it’s fresh. It might even be a sign of what’s to come from the group in the 2020s.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>So what’s Pearl Jam up to now that the album’s out?</p>
<p>Keeping the “safety and well-being” of their fans in mind, according to a statement issued by Vedder on March 9.</p>
<p>Nine days before Pearl Jam’s 2020 Canadian tour was set to kick off in Toronto — with three more concerts scheduled days before the release of Gigaton — the tour was postponed amid concerns of the rapidly spreading novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The statement read: “We have and will always keep the safety and well-being of our supporters as top priority… We have a unique group of passionate fans who travel far and wide. We’ve always been humbled by this and respect their energies and devotion, however, in this case, travel is something to avoid.”</p>
<p>The Gigaton North American tour would&rsquo;ve kicked off today in Toronto. Since we can&rsquo;t be there, we&rsquo;d like to remember a past visit. Pearl Jam has played Toronto 17 times since 1991. This is a ticket from the Sept 12, 2011 show at Air Canada Centre. Thinking of you, Toronto. 🇨🇦 pic.twitter.com/u4a5rpbQIl — Pearl Jam (@PearlJam) March 18, 2020</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>The band was then scheduled to head back to the U.S. to perform 12 additional shows and promote the album starting this week, but the full North American tour was delayed as a result.</p>
<p>Currently, there’s no word of when the rescheduled shows will actually take place.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Pearl Jam’s June/July European and U.K. legs of the tour have been unaffected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Gigaton is now available worldwide through all major streaming platforms.</p>
<p>Physical variants of the record can be purchased through the official Pearl Jam webstore.</p>

<h3 id="pearl-jams-gigaton-is-the-angry-but-hopeful-album-we-need-right-now">Pearl Jam&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gigaton&rsquo; is the angry but hopeful album we need right now</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/25/USAT/fc749377-3f62-4b65-bcd8-4d71d2fcb7cb-AP_Trump_Pearl_Jam.JPG?crop=4361,2453,x0,y47&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Music just hits different when you&rsquo;ve been cooped up in your apartment for nearly two weeks straight.</p>
<p>When Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder wrote and recorded &ldquo;Gigaton,&rdquo; the Seattle rock band&rsquo;s 11th album and first since 2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lightning Bolt,&rdquo; he never could&rsquo;ve predicted it would come into the world during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>But with its thrashing guitars, pummeling drums and anxiety-riddled lyrics, &ldquo;Gigaton&rdquo; (out Friday) is the sort of primal scream we could all use right now as many of us are sequestered at home filled with fear and frustration about our government&rsquo;s response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>More:Zac Brown Band, Pearl Jam, Madonna and more cancel and postpone shows amid coronavirus fears</p>
<p>An outspoken critic of President Donald Trump (at times, controversially so), Vedder calls out the president directly in two songs: In the bruising &ldquo;Quick Escape,&rdquo; he imagines trekking halfway across the world just &ldquo;to find a place Trump hadn&rsquo;t f***ed up yet&rdquo; and gets wistful about the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we think about the old days Of green grass, sky and red wine, Should&rsquo;ve known, so fragile And avoided this one-way flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He elaborates further on the rousing &ldquo;Seven O&rsquo;Clock,&rdquo; which evokes Native American leaders Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s Sitting Bull*** as our sitting president Talking to his mirror, what&rsquo;s he say? What&rsquo;s it say back? A tragedy of errors, who&rsquo;ll be last to have a laugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aside from its sharply political message, &ldquo;Seven O&rsquo;Clock&rdquo; also captures the powerlessness many of us feel to help the doctors, nurses and grocery store clerks who are fighting on the front lines of the pandemic, but with an ultimately hopeful message to leave your despondency &ldquo;in the bed&rdquo; because there&rsquo;s &ldquo;much to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this is no time for depression or self-indulgent hesitance This f***ed-up situation calls for all hands, all hands on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those of us who are fortunate enough to self-quarantine inside and work from home, Vedder reminds us that it&rsquo;s natural to feel overwhelmed by the state of the world and important to take the space you need for yourself. On the spacey, slowed-down &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he sings about turning off and tuning out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, to shut it down Disappear in thin air, it&rsquo;s your home I&rsquo;s alright, to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not giving up is a running theme throughout the album&rsquo;s 12 songs, whether it&rsquo;s regarding a rocky relationship (&ldquo;Take the Long Way&rdquo;) or railing against a &ldquo;government (that) thrives on discontent&rdquo; (&ldquo;River Cross&rdquo;). That defiant spirit and resilience has long been a trademark of Pearl Jam&rsquo;s music but feels all the more reassuring in these uncertain times.

<h3 id="pearl-jam-releases-its-most-striking-album-in-20-years-with-gigaton">Pearl Jam releases its most striking album in 20 years with ‘Gigaton’</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pearl-Jam-Gigaton-Artwork-tzr-780x502.jpg" alt="img">
Album review</p>
<p>Pearl Jam and its grunge-era brethren are officially classic rock. It’s been an entire generation since Eddie and the boys were hailed as the voice of theirs. Nineties teens can now tell their children of a distant time when musicians with guitars roamed the MTV airwaves currently occupied by “Teen Mom OG” and “Jersey Shore Family Vacation.”</p>
<p>On March 27, Pearl Jam will break the longest album drought of its career with the release of “Gigaton” — the Seattle juggernauts’ first studio effort since 2013’s “Lightning Bolt.” And it’s hardly a tired spinoff.</p>
<p>At this stage in their career, the hometown legends have evolved into a cult-favorite live band, their shake-’em-up set lists earning them a rabid following akin to jam bands like Phish. Caravanning fans will pack arenas and stadiums regardless of the ’90s rock heroes’ present day studio habits, yet “Gigaton” is the work of a band unafraid to shake things up in recording sessions, too — just not as drastically as fans may have initially thought.</p>
<p>In January, dancey curveball “Dance of the Clairvoyants” became a certified talker when it was released as the lead single. With Eddie Vedder barking like a disgruntled David Byrne over a digitally steeped drum beat and funky post-punk guitar barbs, the synth-splashed bop sounds nothing like anything the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers had conjured in its 30 years.</p>
<p>While somewhat polarizing, it’s the most exciting and unexpected track the band has unleashed this century, perking the ears of some who’d tuned out ages ago and rankling a few of the die-hards. This sort of split is always a sign of creative health from a veteran band with nothing to prove. Down the road — when bands are able to hit the road again — “Dance” is likely to slide into Pearl Jam’s variegated set lists as well as the Rolling Stones’ disco-charged one-off “Miss You” did during last year’s stellar CenturyLink Field gig. And considering how well Pearl Jam pulled off the Talking Heads-evoking head-turner, it’s almost a shame these creative winds didn’t blow the band even further outside its comfort zone. It may also be worth noting “Dance” is the only song all five members share writing credits on.</p>
<p>The outlier’s closest sibling is probably the marching “Quick Escape,” which feels like a sci-fi warning from a future with unmitigated climate change. Featuring another round of mechanical post-punk guitars, the churning track with a shout-along chorus is punctuated by a supernova of a solo from a peak-form Mike McCready. Throughout “Gigaton,” the celebrated axeman — who dabbled in mixed media during Pearl Jam’s downtime — unleashes torrents of stadium-slaying guitar heroics with the restraint of a quarantined kid hitting the park for the first time in weeks.</p>

<p>Lyrically, “Quick Escape” (which features the album’s most overt Trump reference) is the bleakest point of an otherwise hopeful record. Its heavy political themes were foreshadowed by the melting-ice-cap cover image, the photo taken by acclaimed nature photographer Paul Nicklen in the Arctic Ocean. With its drifting psychedelic intro, “Seven O’Clock” feels like a paean to flickering optimism, a coolheaded call to action in the face of political doublespeak and rising sea levels. Written and recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted everyday life (and Pearl Jam’s tour plans), the global health crisis only amplifies the period of existential dread in which the band’s most topical album in years arrives.</p>
<p>Whether a product of added time or fresh studio blood with Seattle’s Josh Evans taking over producer duties from frequent Pearl Jam collaborator Brendan O’Brien, the quintet seemed eager to experiment on its 11th studio album. But despite some stylistic dalliances, much of “Gigaton” is tried-and-true Pearl Jam. Midtempo rawk bruisers arrive with varying spice levels, with classic rock-indebted “Never Destination” serving as a highlight. Vedder comes out charging like a younger Springsteen with Whovian power and swagger. We half expected friend of the band Pete Townshend to come windmilling in after the first chorus. Meanwhile, “Comes Then Goes” is a classic Vedder acoustic ballad as savory as any. Instead of feeling cliché, his “the kids are all right” lyric comes off as a knowing wink to the past and future from a 50-something rock star with half a lifetime’s wisdom to draw from.</p>
<p>Ultimately, “Gigaton” may not appeal to anyone who hasn’t kept up with grunge gods, but it rivals the more cohesive “Backspacer” as a late-career high water mark.</p>
<p>If the kids are all right, so are their MTV-generation parents who refuse to settle for a reboot.
