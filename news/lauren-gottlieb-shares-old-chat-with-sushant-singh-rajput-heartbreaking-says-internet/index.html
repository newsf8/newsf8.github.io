<p>Actor-dancer Lauren Gottlieb has shared screenshots of a 2016 Whatsapp conversation with Sushant Singh Rajput on Instagram. In the chat, the late actor encourages Lauren and tells her that he survived the industry because most of the ones around are mediocre.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide on June 14 at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>In the Whatsapp chat, the two actors start with talking about life and career and then shift the conversation towards making a move from television to films. While Sushant told Lauren about finishing shooting for MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Lauren told him about her Punjabi film. Sushant also talks about his upcoming films with Illuminati and Dharma Productions.</p>
<p>Sushant and Lauren then discussed how difficult it is to switch from television to films. &ldquo;But I survived because of choices,&rdquo; Sushant said in the chat, adding, &ldquo;First you need to convince yourself and the world follows (sic).&rdquo;</p>
<p>To encourage Lauren, Sushant then said, &ldquo;If an avg. looking boy with average talent and strong prejudice can make it, trust me anything is possible.. You&rsquo;ve got everything going for u,&hellip; Just have absolute certainity that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s gonna happen (sic).&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Lauren pulled his leg for being modest, he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being modest. I am Good only because most of the ones around are mediocre, but for me it&rsquo;s a long long way to go.. (sic).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sushant then told Lauren that she was extremely passionate which was more than enough. He suggested her to believe and persist and told her that it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Sharing the chat, Lauren wrote, &ldquo;Today, I finally brought myself to look at my WhatsApp messages with Sushant over the years. I came across one conversation that broke my heart all over again, as it was filled with so much love, kindness, and true support for one another’s dreams! I felt a deep connection with Sushant as we were both &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; and I looked up to him tremendously! I wanted to share this chat we had to remind everyone to walk, talk, and treat EVERYONE with this great amount of LOVE and SUPPORT as HE shared!!! I’m seeing so much hate going around. I do not want to tell anyone how to grieve, my process this week looked pretty ugly, BUT I think one of the BEST ways to honor his legacy is to BE THE BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL, LOVING LIGHT that he exuded each and every day. The world is a better place because of Sushant’s humble heart. Let’s keep sharing his magic and be kind to one another (sic).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fans of Sushant Singh Rajput are heartbroken after his demise. Many commented on Lauren&rsquo;s post and said it is heartbreaking. One Instagram user wrote, &ldquo;This really is heartbreaking. He sounds like such an amazing person (sic).</p>
<p>Another one wrote, &ldquo;This is the most amazing way to remember him, celebrate his legacy, celebrate his life and be kind to each other yes, all the best! More power to you (sic).&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death, Lauren shared several pictures of the two from the show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa. She wrote, &ldquo;It’s hard to think of my times in India without thinking about Sushant Singh Rajput. He was the first actor I was introduced to, as both of our debut films released 2 weeks apart. He was the actor who first introduced me on the Jhalak stage. He was the first actor who asked me to choreograph his song. I love Sushant deeply for his constant willingness to take those risks with me and step outside of his comfort zone. I will always be grateful for the advice he gave and knowledge he shared. He blew me away when on my very first episode of Jhalak he told the entire audience that he was a fan of mine from when I was on So You Think You Can Dance and his girlfriend was mad he had my photo as his mobile wallpaper Sushant I’ve been your fan and will always be your fan! RIP Dearest Sushant (sic).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput and Lauren Gottlieb participated in the celebrity dance reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa. While the late actor was part of the show in Season 4, which premiered in December 2010, Lauren participated in Season 7. It was Sushant who introduced Lauren on the Jhalak stage.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.vogue.in/photos/5eec6f969aeed766057e7acb/16:9/w_1920,c_limit/Movies%20in%20iceland.jpg" alt="img">
Sitting cooped up in our houses with not much to do, except dream of travelling to far-off exotic lands–that’s what most of our vacay plans have been reduced to. In these times, all we want to do is to escape to another place, free of worries and pandemics. And can there be a more apt place than Iceland, the Nordic island nation that has often been used to represent other worlds in different movies? With its natural landscapes, icy glaciers, lava fields and rugged terrains, Iceland is a place unlike any other. Here’s a movie compilation that’s bound to transport you to this gorgeous island country.</p>
<p>Journey to The Center Of The Earth (2008)</p>
<p>An adaptation of Jules Verne’s 1864 novel of the same name, this Eric Brevig directorial is about one man’s journey to find his missing brother, which takes him to the centre of the earth. Actors Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson and Icelandic actress Anita Briem transport us to the breathtaking beauty of the Snæfellsnes glacier where many of the movie&rsquo;s segments were shot.</p>
<p>Streaming on Amazon Prime Video</p>
<p>Batman Begins (2005)</p>
<p>Cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000&rsquo;s, Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins traces the origins of Bruce Wayne from the death of his parents to become Batman. The film is a thing of beauty–not just when it comes to understanding the real essence of a superhero but also when it comes to its setting. The beautiful Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland was depicted as Bhutan in the film, where Christian Bale and Liam Neeson battle it out with a sword fight.</p>
<p>Streaming on Amazon Prime Video</p>
<p>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)</p>
<p>The space opera film, the first of the Star Wars standalone movies, was about a group of unlikely heroes who come together to steal the plans to the Death Star, a weapon for mass destruction. The film’s locations included Reynisfjara, and the mountains of Hjörleifshöfði and Hafursey at Mýrdalssandur, used to represent the planets of Lah’mu and Eadu. The third highest grossing Star Wars film was nominated for Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Streaming on Disney + Hotstar</p>
<p>Oblivion (2013)</p>
<p>Tom Cruise’s post-apocalyptic science fiction saga may have been shot in various locations across the US but it is the spectacular beauty of Iceland that catches the viewer’s eye. We can’t help but envy Cruise as he sits next to an 800-foot drop to water a plant and admire the view from the top of Jarlhettur mountain. Visually striking, the film set in 2077 is a sci-fi adventure you don’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Streaming on Amazon Prime Video</p>
<p>Noah (2014)</p>
<p>The rugged terrains and natural landscapes of Iceland provide the perfect setting for this epic Biblical drama inspired from Noah’s Ark from the Book of Genesis. The Russell Crowe-starrer was shot at various locations of the Nordic island nation to represent the world before it was flooded. Some of the filming locations included the gorgeous black sand beach Reynisfjara, the Reykjanes peninsula and the area around Lake Myvatn.</p>
<p>Streaming on Netflix</p>
<p>Interstellar (2014)</p>
<p>In director Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar set in a dystopian future, humanity is struggling to survive on Earth and a team of astronauts is sent to look for other planets where they can survive. The Matthew McConaughey-Anne Hathaway starrer was shot in Máfabót, a low-land area in Iceland and Svínafellsjökull glacier, with the two locations used to represent two different planets.</p>
<p>Streaming on Amazon Prime Video</p>
<p>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)</p>
<p>The gorgeous Angelina Jolie transformed into Lara Croft, an adventurer who sets out to retrieve some ancient artefacts from the Illuminati in this action-adventure film. While the movie was panned by critics, it was a box-office success, owing to Ms Jolie and the Tomb Raider video game on which it was based. There’s a three-minute sequence that takes you to the icy climes of the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, which represents Siberia in the film.</p>
<p>Streaming on Amazon Prime Video</p>
<p>Thor: The Dark World (2013)</p>
<p>The sequel to 2011’s Thor, this superhero film received critical acclaim for its stunning visual effects and performances, particularly by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The Norse mythology hero, Thor returns to his roots making this one of the most extensive projects to be shot in Iceland. While some scenes were filmed around Landmannalaugar, near the volcano Hekla in South Iceland, an aerial shot captured the spectacular shots of Dettifoss, Europe&rsquo;s most powerful waterfall. The other waterfall shown in the film is the stunning Skógafoss.</p>

Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s rumoured girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty was interrogated for almost 9 hours at the police station in relation to his suicide case. She was accompanied by her father.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death has caused a nationwide stir with the entire film fraternity and the countrymen mourning his death. There has been a lot of things that have spiraled post his untimely demise. While social media is boiling with the whole nepotism debate, the Mumbai Police had been investigating the matter. Earlier in the day, the police summoned Sushant&rsquo;s rumoured girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and interrogated her. The interrogation went on for over 9 hours and the actress was accompanied by her father. &ldquo;In the last few months, the person who was the closest to Sushant was Rhea and they were together almost all the time. Police decided to call her first today,&rdquo; the source told us. The same source while talking to us, revealed what the 9-hour interrogation entailed.</p>
<p>Their relationship and marriage</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant were rumoured to be in a relationship and were also staying together the entire lockdown. While both of them never accepted or denied the rumours, the police asked Rhea about it all. &ldquo;Rhea was asked to show all the text messages exchanged between the two. Her entire phone was scanned, including all their pictures and videos together. Rhea spoke about living in with Sushant and also revealed that they were planning to buy a property as well, as revealed by their broker previously. She admitted that they did plan to get married by the end of 2020,&rdquo; the source adds.</p>

<p>The breakup</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant were living at his Carter Road penthouse which he had rented along with his friend, Siddharth Pitani. But she decided to move out with her bags just a few days before Sushant&rsquo;s death. Our source adds, &ldquo;Police raised suspicion about that and also asked her if they had decided to breakup. It seems she informed the police how they had a fight and she left. She showed the text messages exchanged after that between her and Sushant and also told them that they did speak over calls.&rdquo; In fact, Sushant had also called Rhea on Saturday night, a few hours before he allegedly gave up on his life. &ldquo;Rhea happens to be the last person Sushant dialed before going to sleep. The actor called Mahesh Shetty first who didn&rsquo;t answer and then called Rhea who also didn&rsquo;t pick up the call. He went to sleep, woke up and saw Mahesh had returned the call. He called him back but it didn&rsquo;t get connected,&rdquo; call records suggested.</p>
<p>The depression</p>
<p>In the last few months, after Sushant was diagnosed with clinical depression, Rhea was the only person who was with him almost all the time. &ldquo;Police asked her about his behavioural changes that she noticed. She not only spoke about it but apparently showed proof that proved how he was undergoing treatment for clinical depression. Sushant had turned towards meditation and yoga to maintain his well-being. She also told police that there would be days when he would feel extremely low and upset. She also shared that he would refuse to take his medication and she tried to coax him to take them but to no avail,&rdquo; our source reveals. Right after Sushant&rsquo;s death, there was a news report doing the rounds about how Mahesh Bhatt reportedly asked Rhea to vacate the flat and leave Sushant immediately after she told her about him hearing voices and behaving strangely. But it&rsquo;s not known if that was addressed during the interrogation.</p>

<p>Films and projects</p>
<p>With Sushant completely disconnecting himself from the world, Rhea had taken over his work in a way. Rhea and Sushant were supposed to begin Rumi Jaffrey&rsquo;s next but the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown played spoilsport. But she did reveal that Sushant had enough projects in hand and was also talking to many more. According to our source, &ldquo;In fact there was more than one film being planned with Sushant and Rhea together. Sushant&rsquo;s date diary would have been full till next year with the projects he was almost locked in. She gave police the details about all the projects Sushant was in talks for,&rdquo; informed the police.</p>

<p>Relationship with his friends and family</p>
<p>Rhea was also asked about the bond she shared with Sushant&rsquo;s family and friends. There have been news reports that are speculating that she had a strained relationship with Sushant&rsquo;s circle of family and friends. Apparently, she had a major argument with Sushant about his flatmate and friend Siddharth Patani. She expressed her displeasure at Sushant allowing his friend to stay in the house and had even suggested he ask him to vacate the flat. We also hear the actor&rsquo;s family too wasn&rsquo;t too fond of her. &ldquo;She told the police that once she decided to leave knowing Sushant&rsquo;s condition, she also informed his sister and asked her to come and stay with him. But once Sushant decided to end his life on Sunday, the family expressed their reservation about her presence at the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father wasn&rsquo;t allowed inside</p>
<p>Although Rhea was accompanied by her father to the police station, she was interrogated separately. &ldquo;The police questioned her about everything and her father wasn&rsquo;t allowed to be present while she was being interrogated.&rdquo; She could be seen leaving the police station with her dad and when the media quizzed her about it, she just greeted them with folded hands without saying a word.</p>

<p>Now, Rhea has recorded her statement and the police is analyzing everything she had to say. They also plan to call a few others who were in touch with Sushant and met him in the last 10 days before his death. Watch this space for more updates.</p>

<h3 id="les-séries-dété-font-respirer-le-temps">&ldquo;Les séries d’été font respirer «Le Temps»&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.letemps.ch/sites/default/files/styles/share/public/media/2020/06/22/file7b4hybyr9ts1414bmawg.jpg.jpeg?itok=pijM5K9w" alt="img">
Les îles paumées, l’art des insultes ou l’épopée des sous-marins: tous les étés, Le Temps propose à ses lecteurs des articles un peu plus éloignés de l’actualité immédiate, qui reste pourtant son fonds de commerce. Ce sont les «séries d’été». Soyons juste, c’est en partie pour être sûr de «remplir le journal» papier avec des sujets de qualité, dans des périodes où l’actualité ralentit. L’absence d’une matière garantie forcerait le journal à donner plus de place que nécessaire à certains sujets ou événements dont le seul mérite serait d’arriver au bon moment… Pas très journalistique. Nous préférons donc engranger une matière différente, qui permet de garder la tête haute pour passer le cap estival. Nous y travaillons depuis mars avec la volonté de réinventer chaque été nos séries spéciales.</p>
<p>L’autre grande raison d’être des séries d’été, c’est qu’elles arrivent… en été justement, quand la chaleur et les vacances incitent à la détente, au plaisir, aux découvertes légères et joyeuses. Cette année, encore bien plus que d’habitude, nous rêvons de dépaysement, d’aventures, de passion. Déployées sur six pages quotidiennes pendant huit semaines, et sur le web, nos séries cultivent la curiosité. Aperçu.</p>
<p>Balades le long de l’Arnon, de la Veveyse ou de la Venoge; portraits de ces oiseaux qu’on a eu tant de plaisir à réentendre quand les villes se sont arrêtées, ou encore découverte de ces lieux où les transports en commun ne vont pas, ce qui en fait des havres de paix: Le Temps se la joue vert et bleu cet été, en 100 façons de redécouvrir la nature helvétique, tourisme et gastronomie locale inclus.</p>
<p>Une autre partie de ces séries explore l’histoire. L’été 1940 raconté par notre correspondant en France, un gros plan sur les femmes de despotes, un passage en revue carabiné de traîtres et transfuges divers, et une plongée dans la Chine qui s’ouvrait au tournant du XXe siècle. Le passé suisse n’est pas oublié, avec des portraits d’héroïnes romandes historiques, de la Mère Royaume à sainte Marguerite Bays.</p>
<p>Côté culture, nous ferons la part belle aux films catastrophe, aux 40 ans de la mort de John Lennon, à la typographie, ou encore aux chansons écologistes. Les étés «apprenants» peuvent être drôles aussi, qu’on se le dise!</p>
<p>Enfin, une bonne partie de nos séries explorent sous d’autres facettes l’actualité récente. La crise sanitaire a mis en évidence l’étendue des théories complotistes: des Illuminati aux chemtrails, en passant par les virus de laboratoire, la série explore l’origine de ces systèmes d’explication simplistes et ce qui les fait proliférer. Nos journalistes ont aussi enquêté sur ce qui se passe au croisement de l’écologie et de l’économie. Quel parcours ont suivi les produits qu’on trouve dans les supermarchés? Et comment sont recyclés nos emballages? La vie d’une boîte de conserve ou d’une bouteille en verre en dit long sur notre monde…</p>
<p>Lire aussi: Un ovni journalistique pour se souvenir de la pandémie… et rebondir</p>
<p>Rencontres avec des chanceliers, des «avocats du diable» ou des passeurs de goût: ces séries permettent aussi de brosser le portrait des acteurs d’une actualité qui d’habitude file trop rapidement. Et cet été encore, vous lirez les reportages de notre correspondante aux Etats-Unis avant l’élection présidentielle de novembre, avec une immersion en apnée chez les partisans et chez les adversaires de Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Au total, une cinquantaine de thématiques vont être développées sous forme de récits, d’interviews, de chroniques ou de reportages, avec des enrichissements multimédias sur le web et dans des pages au graphisme séduisant. Le maître mot est celui de variété, comme vous avez déjà pu le constater. Du coup, au final, on a envie de dire que c’est sans souci pour nous – j’allais oublier: une chronique sur les usages et mésusages de la langue viendra aussi nous rappeler tout ce que révèle l’évolution des mots, cette matière première des journalistes.</p>
<p>Vivement l’été!</p>
<p>Lire également: Pourquoi «Le Temps» ouvre les commentaires</p>
<p>Séries d’été du «Temps», du lundi 6 juillet au vendredi 28 août.</p>
<p>Cela va sans dire, mots fléchés et sudokus seront aussi de retour.

<p><img src="https://media.gqindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-wild-conspiracy-theory-shows-and-movies-on-Netflix-thatll-make-you-question-your-own-sanity-1366x768.jpg" alt="img">
Truth is stranger than fiction. Okay, sure. But do Lizard People really exist? Is the Earth flat? Is Illuminati really governing the world? Are we all just a science-experiment-gone-wrong stuffed inside a smart alien’s personal locker? Well, I don’t really know! But I do know that Netflix has the answer to some of these questions. The OTT platform is a hotbed for conspiracy theory shows and movies if you’re willing to go down the rabbit hole. And if you’re not sure which conspiracy theory to dive into first, start with the below order of documentary films – conspiracy theory shows and movies on Netflix.</p>
<p>5 wild conspiracy theory shows and movies on Netflix that’ll make you question your own sanity:</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY – NETFLIX</p>
<p>Yes, I know that the name gives the series away in the first go itself, but there’s a lot to look forward to in this 2015 British TV Show. For starters: There are only 12 episodes, and each episode throws light on a completely different conspiracy! Throughout the series, conspiracy theorists as well as skeptics discuss ploys involving aliens, government cover-ups, secret assassinations, secret lives of Hollywood stars and my personal favourite: The moon landing.</p>
<p>THE FAMILY – NETFLIX</p>
<p>Forget the Illuminati, according to this docu-series, an enigmatic yet conservative Christian group known as the Family is the one you should be worried about. “This was a group with tentacles around the world” and they controlled (or still control) the real power and money in the United States. Each episode tries to uncover how the church and state have always worked hand in hand but not for America’s wellbeing. But for power. Of course supporters and skeptics have different opinions about ‘the Family’ throughout the series, which makes it more intriguing.</p>
<p>BOB LAZAR: AREA 51 &amp; FLYING SAUCERS – NETFLIX</p>
<p>Area 51 and its complexities are a conspiracy gift that keeps giving! For years now, conspiracy theorists have claimed that they have proof of the base being a secret alien research centre. But Bob Lazar was perhaps the first guy to throw a massive spotlight on the sector. In this documentary, he talks about his experience working there, the experiments being conducted on alien tech and more.</p>
<p>BEHIND THE CURVE – NETFLIX</p>
<p>This cheeky documentary introduces us to a worldwide community of theorists who really and truly believe that the Earth is flat. This community is called: The Flat Earth Society. It documents the members’ persistent approaches to convince the rest of the world that their claim is true and well, if you get sucked into this one, then you are on your own!</p>
<p>WORMWOOD – NETFLIX</p>
<p>Wormwood is a thrilling six-part series that tries to unwrap the mysterious death of a U.S. scientist entangled in a secret Cold War program known as MK-Ultra. According to the government, he simply fell out of the window but according to his son, the scientist was murdered. The series tries to uncover the nuances of this incident by talking to all parties involved after disturbing facts start coming to light.</p>

<h3 id="illuminati-rumored-for-doctor-strange-2">&ldquo;Illuminati Rumored For Doctor Strange 2&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cosmicbook.news/sites/default/files/illuminati-doctor-strange-2.jpg" alt="img">
The Illuminati, members of the X-Men and more are rumored for Doctor Strange 2, which with the introduction of the Multiverse could be one of Marvel&rsquo;s biggest movies ever.</p>
<p>The rumor comes from the Lords of the Long Box YouTube channel and Mikey Sutton, who have been posting various DC and MCU rumors including that a Wolverine vs Hulk movie is on the way possibly featuring Hugh Jackman.</p>
<p>Check out the info below.</p>
<p>Doctor Strange 2 Illuminati rumors:</p>
<p>Regarding the Doctor Strange 2 rumors, it&rsquo;s claimed that Benedict Cumberbatch&rsquo;s Stephen Strange forms the Illuminati after the events of the Disney Plus series, WandaVision, that sees Scarlet Witch create her own pocket universe which rips open the Multiverse.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of the comics, obviously this is a different take, as in the comics, the Illuminati is ret-conned to have formed after the Kree-Skrull War and after the events of the Infinity Gauntlet which sees Reed Richards collect and give each member an Infinity Gem.</p>
<p>With Thanos having destroyed the Infinity Stones in the MCU, we see how things will take a different route in the films.</p>
<p>Back to the rumor, it&rsquo;s claimed that Doctor Strange will need to form a new superhero group to protect the world from a portal created by Scarlet Witch which has ripped open a way for other worlds and universes to invade the planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s said that Doctor Strange will form the Illuminati, &ldquo;a secret organization of highly intelligent and powerful individuals at the end of the Multiverse of Madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The MCU Illuminati are said to be made up of Strange, Reed Richards from the Fantastic Four, and Professor X of the X-Men, which will mark Xavier&rsquo;s MCU debut.</p>
<p>Additional Illuminati members are said to include Black Bolt from Inhumans, Namor, and Black Panther.</p>
<p>Scarlet Witch huge factor in Illuminati formation</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even claimed that Scarlet Witch will revive Black Widow &ldquo;after wrestling her soul away, she puts the hurt on the Red Skull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also said that Doctor Strange 2 will be followed up by a third Doctor Strange movie that will adapt the Marvel Comics story &ldquo;Triumphant and Torment,&rdquo; and will see Strange team with Doctor Doom to go into hell to save Doom&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s soul from Mephisto (also rumored for DS2).</p>
<p>As noted, this is a lot to pack into one movie, but to be clear, the end of Doctor Strange 2 sees Strange form the Illuminati which leads to other flicks and appearances.</p>
<p>The different multiverses are created by Scarlet Witch who goes crazy and creates multiple different universes, and that is why Strange forms the Illuminati, which is sort of similar to the Marvel comics where the Illuminati is formed to deal with really large threats (i.e. they sent Hulk to Planet Hulk).</p>
<p>MCU Illuminati will be a bit different than the comics</p>
<p>Obviously, Tony Stark and Captain America won&rsquo;t be in the MCU Illuminati, as Stark is dead and Captain America is old and passed the shield to Falcon. To boot, Captain America was kicked off the team in the comics and had his memory wiped because the Illuminati did a lot of the &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; that other heroes couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Marvel now has the rights to all the characters that make up the Illuminati, including Namor, so they can do it on the big screen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also claimed that Marvel still wants Dwayne Johnson as Namor.</p>
<p>While not stated, it&rsquo;s my guess Black Bolt will not be from the ABC series but will be played by a new actor, as the Marvel TV Inhumans series is not MCU canon.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, back in 2016, Benedict Cumberbatch hinted at Marvel&rsquo;s nefarious secret society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m excited to see where the Illuminati and whatever else might happen, how that works, and where it ends up,&rdquo; Cumberbatch said when asked about more from the Sorcerer Supreme.</p>
<p>The Avengers: Age of Ultron also featured an Illuminati Easter Egg.
