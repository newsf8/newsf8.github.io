<p>Just a few days ago, the chemistry between Asim and Himanshi captured the hearts of their fans as the couple&rsquo;s second song Khyaal Rakhya Kar got released.

The fans shared their positive as well as negative reactions in the comments section of the post:</p>
<p>This is not the first of Asim Riaz and Himanshi Khurrana&rsquo;s videos. Before Khyaal Rakhya Kar, Asim Riaz and Himanshi Khurrana featured in a song named Kalla Sohna Nai. The song was released on March 19, 2020. The two actors can be seen romancing to the tunes of the song. The song is sung by Neha Kakkar. While Kalla Sohna Nai is shown to be from Himanshi’s point to view to Asim, Khyaal Rakhya Kar is a song that is from Asim’s end for Himanshi. It seems the young and lovely couple are proud to show off their love and care for each other and also share good chemistry, as claimed by their fans and lovers.</p>
