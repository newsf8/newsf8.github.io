<p>By Express News Service</p>
<p>Saiyami Kher has been praised for her performance in Anurag Kashyap’s Choked. Released on June 5, the Netflix original film centres on a bank cashier who finds an unlimited source of money under her kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The comic thriller is backdropped on the 2016 demonetisation and also stars Roshan Mathew. In a long Twitter thread, Saiyami thanked Anurag for believing in her. She recalled meeting Anurag for the first time and getting to know him personally.</p>
<p>“The first time I met Anurag Kashyap, he called me to his Versova house. Before I could say anything, he said, ‘My parents live with me. You don’t have to worry!’He was supposed to be the “Bad Boy of Bollywood”. His life according to the outside world was “riddled with drugs, women &amp; vices.” The truth, I later learnt, was completely the opposite.</p>
<p>It was a typical chaotic Indian household. Parents looking for a newspaper, the doorbell constantly ringing, Shrilalji furiously cooking for the increasing guests, a cat strutting around &amp; AK looking for just one quiet corner in his own home.” Saiyami shared she and Anurag became friends over the last years. “From the time he offered me Choked (sitting next to me at MAMI) to the date of release, it took three years. That’s when I really got to know the man.</p>
<p>He became a friend, mentor &amp; sounding board. With him you know you get the whole truth. When he loves your work he jumps, dances, cries &amp; expresses joy; if he doesn’t he just says it.”</p>
<p>Saiyami added that Kashyap has no filters, and that is perhaps both his boon and bane.“He loves his whiskey; which I keep nagging him to reduce (and also to increase his exercise!). He has a child-like innocence &amp; open-heartedness that is seldom seen in today’s times. He’s so busy playing agony aunt in other people’s lives that perhaps, he forgets about his own. That’s AK for you. It’s always other people before himself. It’s rare to have people through your difficulties. It’s even rarer to have people who truly feel happy for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saiyami had made her Bollywood debut in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Mirzya (2016). The film, which also starred Harshvardhan Kapoor, had failed to work at the box-office. “Today, when the people who dismissed me three years ago call up lauding my performance, there’s no one happier &amp; prouder than AK,” Saiyami wrote. “Thank you for believing in me, Anurag Kashyap. Thank you for making me believe in myself again!”

<p>Highlights Saiyami Kher shared multiple pictures with Anurag Kashyap</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for making me believe in myself again,&rdquo; Saiyami wrote</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl you don&rsquo;t make a man senti like this,&rdquo; commented Anurag Kashyap</p>
<p>A post from actress Saiyami Kher - &ldquo;long overdue,&rdquo; as she writes - is both a thank you for filmmaker Anurag Kashyap and a bittersweet note on how the film industry defines worth. Saiyami stars in the critically-acclaimed Choked, Anurag Kashyap&rsquo;s latest film; her own performance has been singled out for praise. Just a few years ago, though, Saiyami was largely ignored after the poor performance of her debut film Mirzya in 2016. Cut to now, and the touchstone of success has completely changed how the industry treats Saiyami Kher, as it does.</p>
<p>Saiyami addresses this in her post: &ldquo;Today when the people who dismissed me three years ago call up lauding my performance, there&rsquo;s no one happier and prouder than AK. Thank you for believing in me Anurag Kashyap. Thank you for making me believe in myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saiyami Kher&rsquo;s words about her Choked director are a testimonial, written most tenderly. Anurag Kashyap has something of a reputation - Saiyami Kher calls him the &ldquo;Bad Boy of Bollywood&rdquo; - but she found that his life, instead of being &ldquo;riddled with drugs, women and vices,&rdquo; was quite the opposite. At Anurag&rsquo;s home (his invitation to her was prefaced with &ldquo;My parents live with me, you don&rsquo;t have to worry&rdquo;), Saiyami found &ldquo;A typical chaotic Indian household&rdquo; with a hunt for the newspaper, the doorbell ringing, Anurag&rsquo;s mother cooking.</p>
<p>Saiyami Kher writes of the Anurag Kashyap she knows: &ldquo;With him you know you get the whole truth. When he loves your work, he jumps, dances, cries and expresses joy; if he doesn&rsquo;t, he just says it. The man has no filters. That is perhaps both his boon and his bane.&rdquo; She also writes of his love of whiskey and open-heartedness: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so busy playing agony aunt in other people&rsquo;s lives that perhaps, he forgets about his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Choked, Saiyami Kher plays Sarita Pillai, a middle-class wife and mother struggling to make ends meet as the main breadwinner of her family. Her life changes when she finds bundles of cash clogging her kitchen sink - it changes yet again with the notes ban of 2016. Choked has received glowing reviews; NDTV&rsquo;s Saibal Chatterjee gave it 4 stars.</p>
<p>As Sarita, Saiyami is unrecognisable from Mirzya&rsquo;s Suchitra, engaged to a prince and in love with the man training her in horse riding. &ldquo;No one imagined me to carry off this non-glamorous avatar where people would, for some strange reason, imagine in awkward item numbers. That&rsquo;s really not the person I am. Anurag Kashyap backed me on the film when people said why are you taking this one. He backed me when there were big names saying, they wanted to work with him. What I really admire about him is that once he gives his word, he will stick to it, which is rare in this industry,&rdquo; Saiyami Kher told news agency PTI.

<p>Updated: Jun 19, 2020 21:52 IST</p>
<p>As the uncertainty looms large over theatres reopening, it has sort of made OTT platforms the go-to option for filmmakers to release their ready films. Actor Saiyami Kher, who has done a couple of web projects and had more lined up, hopes that with this new trend of films coming out on web platforms, actors like her don’t lose out on opportunities.</p>
<p>“So far, it has been a very good space for actors like me. Big producers haven’t backed me after my first film,” shares Kher, who made her Hindi film debut with Mirzya in 2016, also her sole Bollywood project till date.</p>
<p>However, glad that OTT proved to be a game changer for her, she adds, “Web has given me the opportunity to showcase my talent and try my hands at different genres. It has opened up avenues for actors like me to do more work. I really hope that it continues and OTT platforms don’t become star driven like Bollywood films in this situation.”</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s not as if Kher feels the charm of cinema can ever go away, and hence, she hopes there can be a balance between the both mediums.</p>
<p>“There was someone like Saif Ali Khan who did a web series (Sacred Games) but that didn’t stop others to make films with other actors as well. I think there’s still place for other actors to find their way,” she continues, “I also hope makers stick to their beliefs and not make it only star driven. They should keep giving opportunities to people who deserve the role, or fit the part.”</p>
<p>Kher is elated with the response her latest web film, Anurag Kashyap’s Choked (based on demonisation) got, and says it’s only because of the OTT platforms that it could make its way to the audiences even during the lockdown.</p>
<p>“Our film was ready for release and timing couldn’t have been more perfect. This is a people where people are just wanting to watch new content because everyone is so fed up of being home because of the situation,” says Kher who is currently in Nasik, Maharashtra with her parents.</p>
<p>“I came here on March 15 and never left. I’m going to stay here till things get back to normal,” she says.</p>

<p>Highlights Saiyami Kher plays the role of a working middle-class mother in Choked</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one imagined me to carry off this non-glamorous avatar,&rdquo; said Saiyami</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been completely worth the wait,&rdquo; she said about working in Choked</p>
<p>Actor Saiyami Kher says people always imagined her in glamorous roles but when Anurag Kashyap offered her the part of a working middle class mother in Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai, she knew she had landed a good film. Saiyami Kher, 28, who made her Hindi film debut with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra&rsquo;s Mirzya, said Kashyap selected her for the role of Sarita Pillai soon after their first meeting, but it took her, co-star Roshan Mathew and scriptwriter Nihit Bhave time to convince him to complete the film. The actor has been praised by critics for her restrained performance as a working mother stuck in a boring job in the Netflix movie, which started streaming from Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one imagined me to carry off this non-glamorous avatar where people would, for some strange reason, imagine in awkward item numbers. That&rsquo;s really not the person I am. Anurag Kashyap backed me on the film when people said &lsquo;why are you taking this one. He backed me when there were big names saying, they wanted to work with him. What I really admire about him is that once he gives his word, he will stick to it, which is rare in this industry,&rdquo; she told news agency PTI in an interview.</p>
<p>Saiyami, who joined the project in 2017, was so determined to get the film made that she said she would turn up on Anurag Kashyap&rsquo;s sets to remind him about his commitment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came on board, he said we will shoot it soon. Meanwhile, scriptwriter Nihit Bhave and I became good friends and he told me that he has been hearing this since 2013. I promised Nihit I will nag him till he makes the movie,&rdquo; the actor said.</p>
<p>She recalled how she would get strange glances from Anurag Kashyap&rsquo;s crew for turning up on the sets of Sacred Games and Lust Stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone on the set except for Nihit and everyone would wonder &lsquo;Why is this Mirzya girl here every day?&rsquo; Then Manmarziyan happened. When Roshan was cast, we got him in our team to corner Anurag to make the movie,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The process of shooting the film was completely different from what Saiyami&rsquo;s experience so far, which was to be ready with her lines.</p>
<p>Anurag Kashyap, in the same interview, said he would not give them lines as he wanted to extract performance out of improvisations, something that threw the actors off initially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anurag sir made it so easy on the sets. He would be like you know what you are doing whether we had lines or not. It almost felt like a big rehearsal and AK would forget to call &lsquo;action&rsquo; or &lsquo;cut&rsquo; and we would keep improvising. It&rsquo;s so liberating as an actor to get a role like this. It has been completely worth the wait,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Saiyami, who is the granddaughter of yesteryear actor Usha Kiran and actor Tanvi Azmi&rsquo;s niece, initially felt insecure about not preparing for her lines in advance but she eventually fell in love with the style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be on the set and sometimes not even get the scenes because AK (Anurag Kashyap) would be like &lsquo;don&rsquo;t give them lines yet.&rsquo; We were thrown at the deep end but once I was comfortable with it, I was very happy. I guess there is some spontaneity that&rsquo;s lost in over preparing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the best moments in the film, including a funny scene where she and Mathew are arguing with the child actor in the middle or the one in which she is venting out to Amruta Subhash, her neighbour, about her marriage, evolved during improvisation,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Bollywood actor Saiyami Kher says people always imagined her in glamorous roles but when Anurag Kashyap offered her the part of a working middle class mother in Choked: Paisa Bolta Hai, she knew she had landed a good film.</p>
<p>Kher, 28, who made her Hindi film debut with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Mirzya, said Kashyap selected her for the role of Sarita Pillai soon after their first meeting, but it took her, co-star Roshan Mathew and scriptwriter Nihit Bhave time to convince him to complete the film.</p>
<p>“No one imagined me to carry off this non-glamorous avatar where people would, for some strange reason, imagine me in awkward special numbers. That’s really not the person I am. Anurag Kashyap backed me on the film when people said ‘why are you taking this one’. He backed me when there were big names saying they wanted to work with him.”</p>
<p>The process of shooting the film was completely different from what Kher’s experience so far, which was to be ready with her lines.</p>
<p>Kashyap, in the same interview, said he would not give them lines as he wanted to extract a performance out of improvisations, something that threw the actors off initially.</p>
<p>“Anurag sir made it so easy on the sets. He would be like you know what you are doing whether we had lines or not. It almost felt like a big rehearsal and AK would forget to call ‘action’ or ‘cut’ and we would keep improvising. It’s so liberating as an actor to get a role like this. It has been completely worth the wait,” she said.

<p>After her Hindi film debut in Rakesh Omprakash Mehra’s film Mirzya (2016), Saiyami Kher made a foray into Telugu and Marathi film with great success. During the lockdown, she had not one but two releases including the web series, Special Ops and later, the Anurag Kashyap directorial Choked that got a positive response. The actor, who has been in Nashik, with her family since 89 days now, says she couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p>Kher says, “It has been overwhelming to see the response for my work. I have got so many messages and since the last four years, I didn’t know what it means to receive praise. It was new and wonderful and I am thankful for all the love. Whether it is an ensemble role or a lead role, when you are appreciated for your work, it always feels great. I was living with Anurag sir’s film for three years since he offered it to me and I was waiting for people to see it. It is quite closer to my heart. And when my idol Sachin (Tendulkar, cricketer) posted about the film and so, I was grinning for three days (laughs). It has been quite an exciting time as a lot of filmmakers have reached out and liked my work.”</p>
<p>After the dismal performance of her debut film, ask her if she feels has arrived and she says, “Be it the criticism that I received back then or the praise coming my way now, I take both with a pinch of salt. Success and failure is a part of the industry. Something works and others don’t and to maintain your sanity, you should not let success or failure get to you. I just hope people remember my good work and I get more exciting roles.”</p>
<p>She adds that it is disappointing when your work isn’t liked as you have put in a lot of effort. “But cinema is a personal experience for many as they connect with it or not. It can be hurtful but I am thankful to have people around me who remind me that I started acting because I enjoyed it. Success and failure is a by product of my work. They tell me not to get affected by either as it will affect my work and if I continue to do what I enjoy, then it will work out,” says the actor who will be seen in a Telugu film next.
