New Delhi: The country saw 10 initial public offerings worth $1.41 billion in the first three months of this year but the median deal size was just $1 million, according to a report. SBI Cards and Payments&rsquo; share sale alone accounted for $1.4 billion mop-up.Consultancy EY on Thursday said consumer products and retail were the most active sectors with three IPOs launched on SME markets with an approximate size of $1 million each.&ldquo;India recorded 10 IPOs ($1.41 billion proceeds and $1 million median deal size) in the first quarter of 2020 with Indian stock exchanges (BSE and NSE including SMEs) ranking eighth globally in terms of number of IPOs,&rdquo; it said.During the first quarter, the IPO (initial public offering) of SBI Cards and Payments was also the biggest in over two years. The issue size was $1.4 billion and the issue was subscribed over 22 times.In the main markets &ndash; the NSE and the BSE, there was one IPO in the first quarter versus five each in the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2019, representing a significant drop of 80 per cent, the report said.&ldquo;In the SME markets, there were nine IPOs in Q1 2020 versus 15 IPOs and 6 IPOs in Q1 2019 and Q4 2019 respectively, representing a significant drop of 40 per cent as compared to Q1 2019 and increase of 50 per cent over Q4 2019, respectively,&rdquo; it noted.Sandip Khetan, partner and national leader ( financial accounting advisory services), EY India , said the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact livelihoods and economies worldwide, creating uncertain times.&ldquo;Indian capital markets have experienced significant erosion of market capitalisation, and companies will take time to recover. While this may present a viable long-term investment opportunity, caution is being observed in the short-term.&ldquo;Sectors like life sciences, pharmaceuticals and digital are likely to revive sooner in the current economic climate,&rdquo; he said.

TimesView It’s understandable, given the gridlock on Bengaluru roads, that people enjoy driving on the expressway. But that doesn’t mean speed limits can be ignored. Limits are there for a reason, but people choose to disregard them - maybe out of machismo, or to make up for lost time, or because they are driving drunk. There&rsquo;s also the Dunning–Kruger effect, where bad drivers think they are good ones and overestimate their capabilities. The problem with speeding is that for most people, it doesn’t feel like a crime. But loss of control could be deadly. And speeding should be punished almost as severely as drunk driving.</p>

<p>BENGALURU: On March 3, a 23-year-old youth driving towards Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on the elevated expressway along Ballari Road jumped the median and crashed into two other cars coming from the opposite direction. The youngster was killed and five others were injured in the mishap, which threw traffic out of gear on the stretch.This was the third case in 2020 of a vehicle jumping the expressway median, claiming lives and disrupting traffic. In fact, two of the six deaths due to accidents reported on the expressway in the first two months of 2020 were caused by median jumping vehicles.Accidents on the expressway claimed 84 lives in 2018 and 77 in 2019. Though traffic police haven’t classified the accidents on the basis of their causative factors, they say vehicles jumping medians were involved in several of them. In June 2019, five members of a family were killed after an ambulance jumped the median and rammed their vehicle.“Preliminary investigation in the March 3 accident showed the car, which jumped the median, was travelling at a speed of at least 120 kmph. Rash driving was the main reason for the accident,” said Sarah Fatima , deputy commissioner of police, traffic (north division).According to Fatima, overspeeding, which accounts for 80% of the accidents on KIA expressway, and lane indiscipline contribute to vehicles jumping medians. “Penalising speeding drivers is the only solution. But we cannot stop vehicles anywhere on the expressway. So we should install more surveillance cameras along the route to catch the erring drivers,” she said.Accident-prone spotsAnother senior traffic police officer said most of these cases happen at Kogilu, Air Force base, Chikkajala, Vidyanagar, Bagalur and Sadahalli. “These are also places where most fatalities are reported,” he added.“The road is designed to drive at a speed between 60 kmph and 90 kmph. But most vehicles easily cross 100 kmph here,” he said.The National Highways Authority of India , which built the expressway, says a suggestion from traffic police to increase the height of the median isn’t feasible. “The road has been designed as per Indian Road Congress standards —which prescribe a height of 230mm for medians on national highways. We cannot change the specifications every time an accident occurs. Efforts must be made to control the speed of vehicles,” an NHAI official said.A senior traffic police officer said instant fine is the best solution. “We should have equipment like a lidar gun which can track offences like overspeeding, not wearing seat belt, jumping lanes, among other things. Traffic police should collect fine for over speeding at the toll plaza near the airport. Collecting spot fine has more impact than sending challans,” he explained.
