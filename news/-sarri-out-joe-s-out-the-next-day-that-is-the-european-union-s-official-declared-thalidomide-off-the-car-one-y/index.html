<p>祖雲達斯周五於歐聯16強意外被里昂淘汰出局，翌日立即官宣辭退執教僅1年的教練沙利。</p>
<p>祖記在官網只用了短短50幾字交代沙利被炒消息：「祖雲達斯宣佈沙利已被解除了他一隊教練的職位，要感謝他為球會寫下歷史新一章，連續第9年稱霸意甲，也是他個人在各級別聯賽事業生涯的最高峯。」</p>
<p>率先爆料的是意大利足球資深記者Fabrizio Romano，周六中午時份在個人Twitter寫上「震撼消息，祖雲達斯已炒掉沙利，官方聲明很快就出，他們會尋找新教練。」隨後，包括意大利天空體育等媒體，都有同樣報道。</p>
<p>這位前拿玻里及車路士教頭，去年夏天才接掌斑馬兵團，與球會簽約3年。縱使球會成功在意甲締造9連霸，但沙利季內一直被批評戰術太單一，也不合球會一向奉行的風格，甚至基斯坦奴朗拿度（C朗）也被爆曾因此與他在更衣室內「炒大鑊」，因此當球隊周五提早在歐聯16強出局後，賽後馬上有不少傳媒及球迷高呼「Sarri Out」，球會也決定與他分道揚鑣。</p>
<p>沙利於18年夏天離開執教3年的拿玻里，前往英超挑戰自我爭取更高成就；這兩年帶領車仔及祖記，分別贏得領軍生涯從未染指過的歐霸盃及意甲錦標，卻因領軍風格與球會不脗合、未能有效控制更衣室甚至不受球迷歡迎，致使戰績也時好時壞，最終合約未到便要提早執包袱。</p>

<h3 id="sarri-sacked-after-juventuss-champions-league-exit">&ldquo;Sarri sacked after Juventus&rsquo;s Champions League exit&rdquo;</h3>

Juventus sacked coach Maurizio Sarri on Saturday after the Italian club&rsquo;s Champions League last 16 exit to Lyon.</p>
<p>Despite Cristiano Ronaldo&rsquo;s double in a 2-1 home win on Friday, Juve fell 2-2 on aggregate to the French club, ending their quest for a title they last won in 1996.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurizio Sarri has been relieved of his post as coach of the first team,&rdquo; the nine-time reigning Serie A champions said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sarri, 61, had replaced Massimiliano Allegri last summer, after leading Chelsea to success in the Europa League.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The club would like to thank the coach for having written a new page in Juventus&rsquo; history with the victory of the ninth-consecutive championship, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the divisions of Italian football,&rdquo; the team said.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Scudetto&rsquo; was the first league title for Sarri in his 30-year coaching career, extending a record run in Turin which Antonio Conte started with three titles from 2012 and Allegri continued with the following five.</p>
<p>But the former Napoli boss paid for the club&rsquo;s failure on the European stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarri Out!&rdquo; headlined Turin sports daily Tuttosport, with Corriere Dello Sport saying: &ldquo;Adieu Maurizio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi, Real Madrid&rsquo;s Zinedine Zidane and former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino have been touted as possible successors.</p>
<p>Club president Andrea Agnelli&rsquo;s words were not reassuring after Juve fell in the last 16 for the first time since 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a cold and lucid analysis,&rdquo; said Agnelli, &ldquo;knowing that in a few weeks we will start from scratch and we will have to do it with the same enthusiasm and desire to win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Champions League, it was a dream before, now it&rsquo;s a goal and going out like this is disappointing for us, for the players and for the fans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarri failed to produce the style revolution hoped for in a season overshadowed by a three-month coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Juve were rarely brilliant and often disappointing, losing in two finals, the Italian Cup and the Italian Super Cup.</p>
<p>They won just two of their final eight league games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarrism&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sarriball&rdquo;, that fast-paced, eye-catching style of football with which he made his name at Napoli, and which Juve bosses craved in Turin, was only seen in flashes this season.</p>
<p>Although Sarri gave the team orders, he adapted to Juve and five-time Ballon d&rsquo;Or winner Ronaldo, who scored 37 goals for in total in the 2019-20 season, breaking the club&rsquo;s record for most goals in a single season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to adapt to the characteristics of the players, you can&rsquo;t ask for 25 purchases. Otherwise I might as well just train myself,&rdquo; said Sarri.</p>
<p>During three seasons with Napoli he turned them into title contenders but they finished second twice and third once behind Juve, before he left for England in 2018.</p>
<p>Chelsea was the only time Sarri has coached outside of Italy but although he won the 2019 Europa League he failed to win over the club&rsquo;s fans during his single season in charge.</p>
<p>But his campaign in Turin was judged by the outfit&rsquo;s quest for a third European crown, having finished runners-up no fewer than five times since last winning in 1996.</p>

Juventus fired coach Maurizio Sarri on Saturday after his first season in charge ended with the team’s Champions League exit.</p>
<p>Despite winning the Italian title, Sarri paid the price for the round-of-16 loss to Lyon on Friday.</p>
<p>“The club would like to thank the coach for having written a new page in Juventus’ history with the victory of the ninth consecutive championship, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the divisions of Italian football,” the team said.</p>
<p>Sarri also left Chelsea last year after only one season in charge–despite winning the Europa League with the London club.</p>
<p>While he led Juventus to a record-extending ninth straight Serie A title, the Bianconeri never really adapted to his quick-passing style and lost four of 12 matches during the restart.</p>
<p>What’s more is that amid so much dominance domestically, the true test for any Juventus coach comes in the Champions League–a competition the Turin club has not won since 1996.</p>
<p>Juventus was eliminated on away goals despite securing a 2-1 victory in the rearranged second-leg home match against Lyon.

<h3 id="andrea-pirlo-replaces-maurizio-sarri-as-juventus-manager">&ldquo;Andrea Pirlo replaces Maurizio Sarri as Juventus manager&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F0810%2Fr412598_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg" alt="img">
Gab Marcotti dissects why Juventus may have appointed Andrea Pirlo over a few other high-profile candidates. (1:27)</p>
<p>Juventus have appointed Andrea Pirlo as coach just hours after sacking Maurizio Sarri following the club&rsquo;s Champions League elimination against Lyon, the club announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pirlo, 41, was a legendary player for the club &ndash; as well as AC Milan and Italy &ndash; over his storied career, winning numerous league titles, the Champions League and a World Cup in 2006. He was appointed manager of Juventus&rsquo; Under-23 side just last month but has now signed a two-year contract to coach the first team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream Serie A games on ESPN+</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s choice is based on the belief that Pirlo has what it takes to lead from his debut on the bench an expert and talented squad to pursue new successes,&rdquo; Juve said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today begins a new chapter of his career in the world of football, as it was said almost a week ago: from Maestro to Mister,&rdquo; it added.</p>
<p>Juventus may be hoping Pirlo can replicate the achievements of Zinedine Zidane, another former world class player who has enjoyed success at Real Madrid despite having no previous coaching experience.</p>
<p>Ex-Juve player Zidane has won two La Liga and three Champions League titles in two stints with the Spanish side since he was first handed the reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decision for Pirlo was very natural, in the Juventus style, because he is someone who played for us, has always been in contact with everyone here and it felt natural,&rdquo; said the club&rsquo;s chief football officer Fabio Paratici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also believe he is pre-destined for greatness. He was as a player and we are confident he can do the same as a coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Sarri, Juventus suffered a round-of-16 exit to the French club despite a 2-1 win on Friday night, losing on the away goals rule as the tie ended 2-2 on aggregate.</p>
<p>A Juventus statement said of his sacking: &ldquo;Juventus Football Club announces that Maurizio Sarri has been relieved of his post as coach of the First Team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The club would like to thank the coach for having written a new page in Juventus&rsquo; history with the victory of the ninth-consecutive championship, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the divisions of Italian football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite winning a ninth successive Serie A title last month, Sarri&rsquo;s team did not manage to convince the critics during his first season in charge. Their failure to even match last season&rsquo;s quarterfinals performance in the Champions League was the final straw for the 61-year-old.</p>
<p>Sarri leaves Juventus with a record of 34 wins in 51 competitive matches, eight draws and nine defeats. Their tally of 83 points in Serie A this season was the lowest of their nine-season run of titles. Juventus also lost the Italian Supercup to Lazio and the Coppa Italia final to Napoli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t devastated by not qualifying, I&rsquo;d be happy with the performance,&rdquo; Sarri said after Juventus&rsquo; defeat to Lyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I actually expected less from us, I think we played a great game. We fell behind to a penalty kick that could have made us lose our heads and we had three chances when we were 2-1 ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Juventus chief Andrea Agnelli said he was adamant Cristiano Ronaldo would stay at the club despite him exiting the Champions League at the round-of-16 stage for the first time since 2010.</p>
<p>A report in France had claimed Ronaldo wanted to move to Paris Saint-Germain. Sources have told ESPN, though, the Ligue 1 side are prioritising the contract renewals of key players Kylian Mbappe and Neymar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am entirely convinced he will stay,&rdquo; Agnelli said. &ldquo;I think the report was down to an interview from several months ago, which just happened to be published just before we played against a French team. It&rsquo;s an old media trick. No, I can assure you that Ronaldo remains a pillar of Juventus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Information from Reuters was used in this report.

<h3 id="pochettino-zidane-inzaghi-who-will-replace-maurizio-sarri-as-juventus-manager">&ldquo;Pochettino, Zidane, Inzaghi: Who will replace Maurizio Sarri as Juventus manager?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gmsrp.cachefly.net/images/20/08/08/ee5d4bd57eccb58af70f88906b93b8bf/1200.jpg" alt="img">
Juventus have brought down the axe on Maurizio Sarri after just one season in charge.</p>
<p>The former Napoli and Chelsea manager has been punished for exiting the Champions League at the round of 16 stage against Lyon as well as a poor run of domestic form and cup final defeats.</p>
<p>Sarri was indeed able to harvest Juventus&rsquo; ninth consecutive Scudetto, but the club finished the season with just two wins from their final eight games.</p>
<p>Sarri sacked by Juventus</p>
<p>The Old Lady also suffered a penalty shootout defeat to Napoli in the Coppa Italia final, while there was similar heartbreak in the Suppercoppa Italia with a 3-1 humbling against Napoli.</p>
<p>The club&rsquo;s official statement read: &ldquo;Juventus Football Club announces that Maurizio Sarri has been relieved of his post as coach of the First Team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The club would like to thank the coach for having written a new page in Juventus&rsquo; history with the victory of the ninth-consecutive championship, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the divisions of Italian football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who will replace Sarri?</p>
<p>So, the question on everybody&rsquo;s lips is this: what next for Juventus?</p>
<p>Sarri never looked like the right fit for the Turin-based side, so it&rsquo;s of paramount importance that Juventus get it spot on this time around and particularly while Cristiano Ronaldo is at the club.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s early speculation that Mauricio Pochettino has been contacted about the job, but it&rsquo;s too early to assume that the former Tottenham boss is strolling to the Allianz Stadium.</p>
<p>So, with a few other names floating around, we&rsquo;ve decided to look at some of the leading and feasible contenders to replace Sarri and give our brief verdict on how they shape up for the role.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettino</p>
<p>Likelihood rating: 10/10</p>
<p>Potential success rating: 9/10</p>
<p>The favourite for the job and it&rsquo;s easy to see why.</p>
<p>The cynics will point out that Pochettino has never actually won a trophy in his managerial career, but moving to Juventus would be the first time he was given the keys to a European giant.</p>
<p>Just look at the job he did at Tottenham, then imagine the results if you swap Harry Kane for Ronaldo, Dele Alli for Paulo Dybala, Davinson Sanchez for Matthijs de Ligt, Jan Vertonghen for Leonardo Bonucci and so on.</p>
<p>That, and the fact he&rsquo;d actually have transfer funds to play around with, something that was largely held back from him in England, to stamp his identity and move away from the 2019/20 stagnation.</p>
<p>So, sure, that lack of trophy-winning experience might give unwanted flashbacks to Sarri, but Pochettino is a far less stubborn and more attack-minded boss that looks the perfect fit in Juve.</p>
<p>Simone Inzaghi</p>
<p>Likelihood rating: 6/10</p>
<p>Potential success rating: 7/10</p>
<p>It would really be a kick in the crown jewels for Italian football if the manager who has done so brilliantly to guide Lazio to second place crossed enemy lines this summer.</p>
<p>Consequently, as much as Inzaghi would be an interesting coup for the Old Lady, we can&rsquo;t see a world where somebody so engrained in the Lazio zeitgeist would let his loyalties slide.</p>
<p>And even if money and the sweet smell of silverware was enough to seduce him, we&rsquo;re inclined to think Juve are looking for a more experienced boss, particularly in terms of Champions League acumen.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane</p>
<p>Likelihood rating: 2/10</p>
<p>Potential success rating: 10/10</p>
<p>As bonkers as this sounds, reports in Italy are name-dropping Zidane as one of the coaches being discussed by the Juventus hierarchy and if that&rsquo;s the case, you can&rsquo;t fault them for ambition.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a manager who won the Champions League three times on the bounce and upon returning to a declining Real side, brought them back to the La Liga summit above Barcelona.</p>
<p>For those reasons alone, Zidane must be considered a 10/10 option for Juve and especially seeing as he has a history at the club, but there&rsquo;s one problem: we can&rsquo;t see it happening.</p>
<p>Zidane&rsquo;s career in management has hitherto revolved around Los Blancos and we can&rsquo;t see that changing until he&rsquo;s once again crowned them the kings of Europe. Weirder things have happened, though.</p>
<p>Massimiliano Allegri</p>
<p>Likelihood rating: 7/10</p>
<p>Potential success rating: 8/10</p>
<p>Is it just me that could see a potential Zidane situation occurring here? You know, club and manager parting ways, then returning soon afterwards when things start going downhill. It&rsquo;s certainly feasible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see Allegri being Juventus&rsquo; first pick by any means, but if they can&rsquo;t get Pochettino or Zidane? They could certainly make worst decisions than re-signing the serial winner.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s good reason to think he could procure that first Champions League title of the century having guided Juve to finals in 2015 and 2017 - a feat he could now improve upon with Ronaldo in his ranks.</p>
<p>Roberto Mancini</p>
<p>Likelihood rating: 1/10</p>
<p>Potential success rating: 2/10</p>
<p>Now this, I hate to say, would be an incredibly retrograde move from Juventus.</p>
<p>Mancini has bundles and bundles of experience winning trophies in his homeland, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but his career in club management has fizzled out ever since his Manchester City sacking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little reason to think Mancini would bring in the sort of fresh ideas that Sarri lacked nor have the ability to steer Juve to Champions League success when he&rsquo;s never made it past the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Andrea Pirlo</p>
<p>Likelihood rating: 4/10</p>
<p>Potential success rating: 3/10</p>
<p>In three years? Maybe. Right now? No chance.</p>
<p>It might be vogue to appoint former players because of their knowledge of the club, but Pirlo has hardly been the Under-23 manager for two seconds, let&rsquo;s not just chuck him straight in the deep end.</p>
<p>Even Zidane had more time working in the youth ranks than Pirlo, so - as much as it might be touted - I&rsquo;m inclined to think reports surrounding the artistic Italian will remain romantic idealism.</p>
<p>Luciano Spalletti</p>
<p>Likelihood rating: 3/10</p>
<p>Potential success rating: 2/10</p>
<p>Slightly more likely than Mancini is about the only compliment I can dish out here, because I&rsquo;m not sure Juve fans would be laying out the red carpet if Spalletti was named Sarri&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>Spalletti does have a track record of silverware in Italy, but although he did a solid job in the Inter Milan dugout, Antonio Conte has shown him up this season by instigating wholesale improvements.</p>
<p>Frankly, if Spalletti is what Juve have in mind, they might as well have stuck with Sarri and prepared for another season of &lsquo;just&rsquo; winning Serie A - and even that wouldn&rsquo;t be guaranteed.</p>
<p>GIVEMESPORT&rsquo;s Kobe Tong says</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be Poch for me.</p>
<p>Zidane would be the dream appointment, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, but I&rsquo;m keeping my feet on the ground here and I can&rsquo;t see a serial winner like himself leaving Real on the note of Champions League elimination.</p>
<p>Rather, while Zidane tries to recoup the European Cup for Real, I&rsquo;m anticipating that Pochettino will be selected in the hope he can breathe some life and fluidity into this Juventus side.</p>
<p>When you consider how much Pochettino overachieved as Tottenham boss, it&rsquo;s a worrying thought for the rest of Europe if he has a squad containing Ronaldo and Dybala on his hands.</p>
<p>You can expect the Argentine to sift out some of the deadwood in the squad, really unshackle the attacking players and implement a brand of football that&rsquo;s successful in Europe as well as Italy.</p>
<p>And if nothing else, having such a world-class manager free to seduce is such a rare opportunity that it would be rude to pass it up.</p>
<p>The time is ticking for Juve to procure a Champion League trophy from this generation of players and Pochettino seems the best bet of anybody to bring &lsquo;Big Ears&rsquo; to Turin after 25 long years.</p>

<p>TURIN, Italy (AP) &ndash; World Cup winner Andrea Pirlo was named Juventus&rsquo; new coach on Saturday, hours after Maurizio Sarri was fired.</p>
<p>Pirlo was given a two-year contract, Juventus announced.</p>
<p>Sarri was fired after his first season in charge ended with the team&rsquo;s Champions League exit.</p>
<p>Despite winning the Italian title, Sarri paid the price for the round-of-16 elimination by Lyon on Friday.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, Pirlo had been appointed coach of Juventus&rsquo; under-23 team, which plays in Serie C. But he had not led a game yet in his first coaching job.</p>
<p>Nicknamed &lsquo;&lsquo;the maestro&rsquo;&rsquo; for his passing skills, Pirlo as a player helped Italy win the 2006 World Cup and also won Serie A six times - twice with AC Milan and four times with Juventus. He also won the Champions League twice with Milan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Today begins a new chapter of his career in the world of football, as it was said almost a week ago: from Maestro to Mister,&rsquo;&rsquo; Juventus said of Pirlo. &lsquo;&lsquo;From today he will be THE coach for people of Juventus. &hellip; Today&rsquo;s choice is based on the belief that Pirlo has what it takes to lead from his debut on the bench an expert and talented squad to pursue new successes.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The announcement comes three years after the 41-year-old Pirlo ended his playing career and five years after he left Juventus for New York City FC.</p>
<p>Sarri left Chelsea last year after only one season in charge &ndash; despite winning the Europa League with the London club.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The club would like to thank the coach for having written a new page in Juventus&rsquo; history with the victory of the ninth consecutive championship, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the divisions of Italian football,&rsquo;&rsquo; the team said of Sarri.</p>
<p>While he led Juventus to a record-extending ninth straight Serie A title, the Bianconeri never really adapted to Sarri&rsquo;s quick-passing style and lost four of 12 matches during the restart.</p>
<p>Amid so much dominance domestically, the true test for any Juventus coach comes in the Champions League &ndash; a competition the Turin club has not won since 1996.</p>
<p>Juventus was eliminated on away goals despite securing a 2-1 victory in the rearranged second-leg home match against Lyon.</p>
<p>Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo made no mention of Sarri in a message posted on Instagram after the Juventus announcement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The 2019/20 season is over for us, much later than usual but yet sooner than we expected,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ronaldo said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s time for reflection, time to analyse the ups and downs because critical thinking is the only way to improve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;A huge club such as Juventus must always think like the best in the world, work like the best in the world, so that we can call ourselves one of the best and biggest clubs in the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Winning the Serie A once again in such a difficult year is something that we are very proud of. &hellip; But the fans demand more from us,&rsquo;&rsquo; added Ronaldo, who scored both of Juve&rsquo;s goals against Lyon. &lsquo;&lsquo;May this short vacation break allow us all to make the best decisions for the future and come back stronger and more committed than ever.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next season&rsquo;s Serie A is scheduled to start Sept. 19.</p>
