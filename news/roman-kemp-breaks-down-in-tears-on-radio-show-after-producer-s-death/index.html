<p>Roman Kemp broke down in tears on his Capital Breakfast radio show this morning after the death of the show’s producer, Joe Lyons.</p>
<p>Joe – who worked for Capital’s parent company, Global, for nine years – died of unknown causes on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Roman and his co-presenters, Sian Welby and Sonny Jay, took time off from the show last week after hearing the devastating news.</p>
<p>And the 27-year-old host couldn’t hold back the emotion as he paid tribute to his ‘best friend’ in his first show back since the tragedy.</p>

<p>‘We wanted to share some really sad news. I never thought I’d have to do this ever,’ Roman said.</p>

<p>The show’s producer, Joe Lyons, died last week (Picture: Instagram)</p>
<p>Roman went on: ‘We are trying to process this all together. We wanted to share this news with you.</p>
<p>‘Joe had worked for Global, the parent company, for nine years. He was the very first person I met when I walked through the door. I remember thinking he was a bit of a Del Boy.</p>
<p>‘He was with me right from my very first show. He taught me everything. I don’t know sitting in a radio studio without him.</p>
<p>‘He’s the person I’d sit here and rinse constantly.’</p>
<p>Roman called Joe a ‘genius’ (Picture: Capital)</p>
<p>The son of Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp added: ‘He loved dogs. Obsessed with his daily step count. Never ironed his clothes.</p>
<p>‘He loved his family so much. His dad Ivan, his mum Celia, his sister Lou. The thing he loved most of all was doing this show, you listening.</p>
<p>‘He was like a genius coming up with these ideas. He was driven by the reaction from you every day.’</p>
<p>He said Joe was his ‘best friend’ (Picture: Instagram)</p>
<p>Roman’s mother, Shirlie Kemp, also paid tribute to Joe.</p>
<p>She wrote on the producer’s final Instagram post, shared on June 20, ‘God Bless you Joe …. you were and always will be so loved.’</p>
<p>Fellow Capital Breakfast presenter Vick Hope commemorated Joe in a moving post on Instagram on Monday.</p>
<p>Sharing a series of photos of them, she wrote: ‘Our Joe. My JoeJoe. My special, magical, beautiful friend. We signed off every message with “I love you, buddy”, and yet I’m worried I still didn’t tell you enough.</p>
<p>‘For the last four years you have been my solace, my rock, my confidante. I’ve told you all my secrets, and you said you’d take them to the grave. And now it seems you did just that, and it breaks my heart.</p>
<p>‘Words cannot describe this pain, it doesn’t make sense and it’ll take time to process. I keep repeating: Not you, please not you.</p>
<p>‘But now you’re at peace, you’re in a better place. I’m going to miss you Joe Lyons, so much.’</p>

<p>&lsquo;I really do love you, bud, so so much. We all do. I hope you know that. We are so lucky to have known you. The world is a better place for having had you in it. And now the stars have gained an extraordinary gift in you. Look at everything you made, Joe. Everything you achieved, what you built, who you inspired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your talent and creativity are so immense, but more than that you are the kindest, most hilarious, caring, fun, fiercely loyal and spectacular person any of us had the pleasure of meeting. You really are the best one we ever knew. Our friend. My friend.</p>

<p>She continued: &lsquo;Thank you for every crab dance, every &ldquo;you’re embarrassing us babe&rdquo;, every cereal box game, every 5am-er at a houseparty we’re not invited to, every &ldquo;bah bah&rdquo;, every undersized chino, every photobomb courtesy of your a**e, every cocktail we shook in your flat or evening spent in my yard doing things we shouldn’t on a school night, every club we sat in the corner of scheming, every time we were back and ready to do it all over again, every single damn laugh, every hug that meant the world because you made me feel safe and understood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And thank you for being my favourite valentine. We met our match in each other. I’ve never encountered anyone else as weird and as wild, and together we were chaos.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wherever you are I hope you’re causing chaos there too. We never wanted the party to end, and I don’t believe this one is over either; I’ll just see you at the afterparty. Until then, I love you, buddy. My thoughts are with your parents and Lou; Ro, Sonny and the team; Olly and everyone who loves you.&rsquo;</p>

Caroline Flack&rsquo;s death has been ruled a suicide following an inquest in London today.</p>
<p>The Love Island host, 40, was found hanged at her Stoke Newington, North London, home on February 15 this year.</p>
<p>She died just a day after learning the CPS was going ahead with her trial on a charge of assault by beating stemming from an alleged bust-up with boyfriend Lewis Burton in December 2019.</p>
<p>An inquest into her death resumed at Poplar Coroner’s Court in London this morning for a second day before Senior Coroner Mary Hassell.</p>
<p>Caroline&rsquo;s family, including her mother Christine and twin sister Jody, attended the inquest via video link.</p>
<p>At the end of today&rsquo;s hearing, the coroner ruled it was suicide.</p>
<p>She told the court: &ldquo;The key decision for me to make is whether Caroline took her own life.</p>
<p>“I have to be satisfied she acted in a way so as to cause her death, and secondly that she intended to cause her death.</p>

<p>“In Caroline’s case I am entirely satisfied she intended to cause her own death.</p>
<p>“She hanged herself. She had only one expectation – her own death.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt in my mind at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner said: “Caroline had fluctuating mental ill health, she had had struggles in the past.</p>
<p>“She had had difficulties. In spite of the fact she may have led – to some extent – a charmed life, actually the more famous she got the more some of these difficulties increased – she had to deal with the media in a way most of us don’t.</p>
<p>“It was played out in the national press – and that was incredibly difficult for her.</p>
<p>“She faced the prospect of not working in the job she loved, losing a great deal.</p>
<p>“I find the reason for her taking her life was she now knew she was being prosecuted for certainty, and she knew she would face the media, press, publicity – it would all come down upon her.</p>
<p>“To me, that’s it in essence.”</p>
<p>Caroline&rsquo;s mother Christine cried as she told the coroner: “I totally agree, I think you got it spot on.</p>
<p>“We know you are not allowed to say certain things and it’s up to us if we want to take it any further, and we don’t. You’re spot on.”</p>

<p>The coroner told her: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very very sorry for the loss of such a young life in such a needless way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She concluded: &ldquo;Caroline hanged herself at home on the morning of February 15 because of an exacerbation of fluctuating ill health and distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the inquest, the court heard that Caroline had left a note for her boyfriend on the day of her death.</p>
<p>It expressed her desire to end the assault case and get her romance with Burton back on track.</p>
<p>The note read: &ldquo;Please let this court case be dropped and myself and Lewis find harmony.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The court also heard how Caroline had taken an overdose on the night before her court appearance in December.</p>
<p>She was also treated by paramedics the night before her death after her friends called an ambulance to her home, but the telly presenter refused to be taken to hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The court heard that Caroline&rsquo;s assault case was going to be dealt with as a caution - which would have stopped her case going to court - until police appealed the prosecutor&rsquo;s decision.</p>

<p>Caroline&rsquo;s mum Christine was given the opportunity to ask questions of one of the police officers involved in the case, Detective Inspector Lauren Bateman.</p>
<p>She told the officer Caroline &ldquo;killed her herself&rdquo; because of the police&rsquo;s decision to appeal.</p>
<p>Christine went on: &ldquo;I just think you should be disgusted with yourself. I hope in hindsight you do regret this&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never saw Caroline. You never saw any evidence. You went on a drunken phone call from a man.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lisa Ramsarran, deputy chief Crown prosecutor, was recalled to give further evidence about the decision to prosecute.</p>
<p>When asked if she would have done anything differently, she told the court: &ldquo;I am satisfied that the code for crown prosecutors was appropriately and consistently applied in this case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inquest has heard a lot of information about the deterioration in the decline in Caroline&rsquo;s mental health. That information was not known by the Crown Prosecution Service.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>After she finished, Christine told her: &ldquo;After this interview and the last I feel even more that you had it in for Caroline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now know how Caroline felt and it&rsquo;s not very nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The former Love Island host, 40, took her own life at her flat in Stoke Newington, north-east London on February 15 days after learning her trial over an alleged attack on boyfriend Lewis Burton was going ahead.</p>
<p>She was charged with assault by beating after a row at her London flat with Burton.</p>
<p>Caroline pleaded not guilty and her boyfriend always maintained her innocence, while her family slammed prosecutors for pursuing the case against the star - calling it a &ldquo;show trial&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She stepped down from hosting Love Island, and in an unpublished Instagram post released by her family after her death Caroline said her &ldquo;whole world and future was swept from under my feet&rdquo; after her arrest.</p>

<p>LUZERNE COUNTY, Pa. &ndash; Friends of an elderly couple killed in a crash in Luzerne County are mourning their sudden loss.</p>
<p>Jenkins Township police say Joseph and Gloria Lyons of Forty Fort died after a head-on collision Thursday night.</p>
<p>Laura Gaiterri reacts with stunned shock after learning her next-door neighbors were killed in a crash.</p>
<p>“I can&rsquo;t believe it, I cannot believe it, I just, no,” said Gaiterri.</p>
<p>Jenkins Township police say 83-year old Joseph and 80-year-old Gloria Lyons of Forty Fort died at the hospital after being involved in a head-on collision on a stretch of River Road around 5:40 Thursday night.</p>
<p>The crash shut down the busy road for hours.</p>
<p>Gaiterri was actually stuck in the backlogged traffic caused by the road closure.</p>
<p>“We were going over the 8th street, my daughter and I and they said there was a head-on by the railroad, head-on collision by the railroad,” said Gaiterri.</p>
<p>Forty Fort Mayor Andy Tuzinski knew the couple well, especially Joseph, who coached Tuzinski in Little League when the mayor was 9 and 10 years old.</p>
<p>“Both of them, a gentleman and a lady in the truest sense of the word,” said Tuzinski. “They maintained a beautiful home in Forty Fort, a modest, but beautiful home in Forty Fort.”</p>
<p>Gaiterri says the Lyons have lived next door since she moved to the borough nearly 50 years ago.</p>
<p>“I can&rsquo;t even imagine, I can&rsquo;t imagine not seeing them, I can&rsquo;t imagine it,” said Gaiterri.</p>
<p>Police say the driver and passenger of the other vehicle involved also went to the hospital.</p>
<p>A nearby business owner on River Road says he saw one of the vehicles pushed onto the grass, which is littered with debris from the crash. That business owner did not want to talk on camera but tells me he sees at least two crashes a year here on River Road.</p>
<p>Now Gaiterri says her only solace is that the couple is now together forever.</p>
<p>“The only thing is they went together because they were so close, he was such a family man and she was such as family, they were just all very, very close family.”
