<p>Advertisement The Federal Reserve recently suggested that the U.S. economy will shrink by 6.5% – its worst annual performance since World War II. The Fed also expects unemployment to finish the year over 9%. Those are good reasons to develop a heightened interest in high-yield ETFs (exchange-traded funds). That&rsquo;s because the Fed&rsquo;s key interest rate likely will hover around 0% for the next 24 to 36 months, leaving investors starved for income, while Fed Chairman Jerome Powell uses every tool at his disposal to help restart the economy. &ldquo;(The outbreak) will weigh heavily on economic activity. (It) poses considerable risks to the economic outlook,&rdquo; Powell stated June 10. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not even thinking about raising rates. We&rsquo;re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.&rdquo; That should make it all the more difficult to generate above-average income from equity and bond ETFs in the near to mid-term. Difficult … but not impossible. Here are five high-yield ETFs delivering at least 4% in annual income that you can buy for the long-term Data is as of June 16. Dividend yields represent the trailing 12-month yield, which is a standard measure for equity funds.</p>

<p>Assets under management: $30.1 billion</p>
<p>Dividend yield: 4.1%</p>
<p>Expenses: 0.12% COVID-19 has definitely put real estate investors on edge. Retail real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been hit by forced closures of non-essential businesses. And as remote working is adopted by American companies on a full-time basis, office REITs might experience some short-term pain (at the least) as the demand for office space slows. Fortunately, the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ, $83.40) only invests 8% of the portfolio&rsquo;s $30 billion in assets in office REITs. The top three categories of REITs in VNQ are specialized REITs (42%), residential REITs (14%) and industrial REITs (11%). In total, Vanguard&rsquo;s ETF invests in 12 different real estate categories. This is a top-heavy fund, however. Of its 183 holdings, the top 10 account for nearly 40% of the fund&rsquo;s assets. Those larger holdings include the likes of American Tower (AMT), Prologis (PLD) and Equinix (EQIX). There are a few restrictions keeping VNQ from being too lopsided, however. The ETF tracks the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index, which keeps VNQ from investing more than 25% of its assets in a single stock. Further, the stocks weighted at more than 5% can&rsquo;t add up to more than 50% of the portfolio. This provides diversification while limiting the exposure to a single real estate investment. As for the dividends? REITs are a traditionally income-friendly sector, and a down year for this high-yield ETF has brought the yield above 4%. Learn more about VNQ at the Vanguard provider site.</p>

<p>Preferred stock Assets under management: $5.6 billion</p>
<p>$5.6 billion SEC yield: 5.3%*</p>
<p>5.3%* Expenses: 0.52% Warren Buffett is one investor that isn&rsquo;t afraid to invest in preferred stocks. Even when it means he might have to wait for a return on his investment. Preferred stocks are so called &ldquo;stock-bond hybrids&rdquo; that trade on exchanges like stocks, but deliver a set amount of income and trade around a par value like a bond. For instance: In 2019, Buffett invested $10 billion in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) preferred stock that paid Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) 8% in annual dividends. (Buffett also received warrants to buy 80 million shares of the oil and gas company at $62.50; unfortunately, falling oil and gas prices have put that investment into question.) Even though preferred stock isn&rsquo;t nearly as volatile as traditional common shares, there&rsquo;s still risk in owning individual shares. A fund such as the Invesco Preferred ETF (PGX, $14.32) is an excellent way for investors to generate above-average income while maintaining a diversified portfolio of preferreds. PGX tracks the performance of the ICE BofAML Core Plus Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index, which invests at least 80% of its assets in fixed-rate U.S. dollar-denominated preferred securities. These securities have a minimum average credit rating of B3 (well into junk territory), but almost two-thirds of the portfolio is investment-grade. The portfolio is reconstituted and rebalanced on a monthly basis. Invesco Preferred ETF&rsquo;s nearly 300 holdings are most heavily concentrated in financials (63%), followed by utilities (14%) and real estate (9%). Energy is 2% of the portfolio, but Occidental isn&rsquo;t included. * SEC yield reflects the interest earned after deducting fund expenses for the most recent 30-day period and is a standard measure for bond and preferred-stock funds.

<p>Large value Assets under management: $2.0 billion</p>
<p>$2.0 billion Dividend yield: 6.4%</p>
<p>6.4% Expenses: 0.07% The commission-free trading app Robinhood has gotten a lot of press recently for its account holders buying stocks either in or near bankruptcy – a quick way to make a bundle or lose your shirt. But Robinhood users also hold plenty of more stable investments, including ETFs. The SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD, $29.77) is held by 25,828 accounts, making it one of the most popular high-yield ETFs on the site and the 15th most-held ETF among Robinhood account holders as of this writing. What makes SPYD special? Cost is no doubt a factor. State Street charges a management expense ratio of just 0.07%, making it one of the 100 least expensive ETFs in the U.S. If fees matter, and they should, SPYD is an excellent possibility. A second attractive feature of the ETF is that it tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 80 highest-yielding companies. If you&rsquo;re looking for income, capital appreciation, and relative safety, it&rsquo;s hard to beat SPYD. The fund&rsquo;s tracking index is the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index excludes any stocks under $8.2 billion in market value. Further, the weighted average market cap of the 64 holdings is $50.2 billion. Top holdings include the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), General Mills (GIS) and AbbVie (ABBV). If you&rsquo;re interested in smaller companies, this isn&rsquo;t the ETF for you. Learn more about SPYD at the SPDR provider site</p>

<p>Foreign Small/Mid Value Assets under management: $1.3 billion</p>
<p>$1.3 billion Dividend yield: 4.5%</p>
<p>4.5% Expenses: 0.58% The WisdomTree International SmallCap Dividend Fund (DLS, $57.00) is the third-largest of WisdomTree&rsquo;s 22 international ETFs with total assets of $1.3 billion. It tracks the performance of the WisdomTree International SmallCap Dividend Index, which consists of stocks with market caps in the bottom 25% of the WisdomTree International Equity Index, after removing the 300 largest companies. Investors might shy away from this ETF because the roughly 900 components are based outside the U.S. and Canada. Further, some might consider it unusual to have a dividend focus when investing in smaller companies. However, WisdomTree has had great success over the years with international small caps. &ldquo;At WisdomTree, we believe that dividends provide an objective measure of a company&rsquo;s health and profitability – one that cannot be affected by accounting methods or government decisions,&rdquo; WisdomTree argues. &ldquo;We have been weighting by dividends since WisdomTree launched its first ETFs in 2006.&rdquo; The ETF&rsquo;s top three country allocations are Japan (34%), Australia (11%) and the United Kingdom (9%). The top three sectors are industrials (20%), financials (16%) and consumer discretionary (14%). The top 10 holdings account for just 6.0% of the portfolio, and the average weighting is 0.11%, which are both great signs of diversification – something else you might consider important when investing in small-cap stocks.

<p>High-yield bond Assets under management: $5.3 billion</p>
<p>$5.3 billion SEC yield: 4.8%</p>
<p>4.8% Expenses: 0.15% The Xtrackers USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYLB, $47.82) is the only fixed-income fund in this list of high-yield ETFs, which makes sense given how low yields have been driven on many other types of bonds. HYLB, which tracks the performance of the Solactive USD High Yield Corporates Total Market Index, has gathered $5.3 billion in total net assets – a good amount by broad ETF standards. It&rsquo;s far smaller than some of the largest U.S.-listed fixed-income ETFs, such as the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), which has more than $74 billion under management. However, when it comes to high-yield U.S. corporate bond ETFs, it is the fourth-largest out of 25 covered by ETF.com. More importantly, of the 25, it&rsquo;s tied for the highest FactSet rating at A-. Why would someone want to own HYLB? First, it has a relatively inexpensive management expense ratio of 0.15%, which gives investors a diversified portfolio of more than a thousand corporate bonds. It also yields 4.8%, which is excellent considering the Fed&rsquo;s benchmark rate is expected to be near 0% for at least the next couple of years. Not only does it have a high rating from FactSet, but it also has a four-star rating from Morningstar based on its performance over the trailing three-year period. (HYLB listed in 2016.) Lastly, most of the bonds are rated BB or B (the two highest tiers of junk) by the major credit rating agencies. Learn more about HYLB at the DWS provider site.</p>

<h3 id="5-things-i-learned-debating-the-harvard-prof-who-called-for-a-presumptive-ban-on-homeschooling">&ldquo;5 Things I Learned Debating the Harvard Prof Who Called for a &lsquo;Presumptive Ban&rsquo; on Homeschooling&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://fee.org/content/images/favicon.ico" alt="img">
On Monday, I debated the Harvard professor who proposes a “presumptive ban” on homeschooling. Thousands of viewers tuned in to watch the live, online discussion hosted by the Cato Institute. With 1,000 submitted audience questions, the 90-minute webinar only scratched the surface of the issue about who is presumed to know what is best for children: parents or the state. Here is the replay link in case you missed it.</p>
<p>Last week, I outlined much of my argument against Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet that I incorporated into our debate, but here are five takeaways from Monday’s discussion:</p>
<ol>
<li>There Are People Who Believe the State Should Be Your Co-Parent</li>
</ol>
<p>While this event was framed as a discussion about homeschooling, including whether and how to regulate the practice, it is clear that homeschooling is just a strawman. The real issue focuses on the role of government in people’s lives, and in particular in the lives of families and children. In her 80-page Arizona Law Review article that sparked this controversy, Professor Bartholet makes it clear that she is seeking a reinterpretation of the US Constitution, which she calls “outdated and inadequate,” to move from its existing focus on negative rights, or individuals being free from state intervention, to positive rights where the state takes a much more active role in citizens’ lives.</p>
<p>During Monday’s discussion, Professor Bartholet explained that “some parents can’t be trusted to not abuse and neglect their children,” and that is why “kids are going to be way better off if both parent and state are involved.” She said her argument focuses on “the state having the right to assert the rights of the child to both education and protection.” Finally, Professor Bartholet said that it’s important to “have the state have some say in protecting children and in trying to raise them so that the children have a decent chance at a future and also are likely to participate in some positive, meaningful ways in the larger society.”</p>
<p>It’s true that the state has a role in protecting children from harm, but does it really have a role in “trying to raise them”? And if the state does have a role in raising children to be competent adults, then the fact that two-thirds of US schoolchildren are not reading proficiently, and more than three-quarters are not proficient in civics, should cause us to be skeptical about the state’s ability to ensure competence.</p>
<p>I made the point on Monday that we already have an established government system to protect children from abuse and neglect. The mission of Child Protective Services (CPS) is to investigate suspected child abuse and punish perpetrators. CPS is plagued with problems and must be dramatically reformed, but the key is to improve the current government system meant to protect children rather than singling out homeschoolers for additional regulation and government oversight. This is particularly true when there is no compelling evidence that homeschooling parents are more likely to abuse their children than non-homeschooling parents, and some research to suggest that homeschooling parents are actually less likely to abuse their children.</p>
<p>Additionally, and perhaps most disturbingly, this argument for more state involvement in the lives of homeschoolers ignores the fact that children are routinely abused in government schools by government educators, as well as by school peers. If the government can’t even protect children enrolled in its own heavily regulated and surveilled schools, then how can it possibly argue for the right to regulate and monitor those families who opt out?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Random Home Visits Will Be a Weapon of the State</li>
</ol>
<p>Of all the recommendations included in the Harvard professor’s proposed presumptive ban on homeschooling, the one that caused the most uproar among both homeschoolers and libertarians was the call for regular home visits of homeschooling families, with no evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In my remarks during Monday&rsquo;s debate, I included a quote from a Hispanic homeschooling mother in Connecticut who was particularly angry and concerned about imposing home visits on homeschooling families. (According to federal data, Hispanics make up about one-quarter of the overall US homeschooling population, mirroring their representation in the general US K-12 school-age population.) She made the important point that minority families are increasingly choosing homeschooling to escape discrimination and an inadequate academic environment in local schools. She also pointed out that, tragically, it is often minorities who are most seriously impacted by these seemingly well-meaning government regulations. Writing to me about Professor Bartholet’s recommendation, she said:</p>
<p>“To state that they want to have surveillance into our homes by having government officials visit, and have parents show proof of their qualified experience to be a parent to their own child is yet another way for local and federal government to do what they have done to native Americans, blacks, the Japanese, Hispanics, etc in the past. Her proposal would once again interfere and hinder a certain population from progressing forward.”</p>
<p>Anyone who cares about liberty and a restrained government should be deeply troubled by the idea of periodic home visits by government agents on law-abiding citizens.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Private Education Is in Danger</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the landmark 1925 US Supreme Court decision that ruled it unconstitutional to ban private schools, there remains lingering support for limiting or abolishing private education and forcing all children to attend government schools. Homeschooling is just one form of private education.</p>
<p>In her law review article, Professor Bartholet recommends “private school reform,” suggesting that private schools may have similar issues to homeschooling but saying that this topic is “beyond the scope” of her article. Still, she concludes her article by stating that “to the degree public schools are seriously deficient, our society should work on improving them, rather than simply allowing some parents to escape.”</p>
<p>The government should work to improve its own schools, where academic deficiencies and abuse are pervasive. But it should have no role in deciding whether or not parents are allowed to escape.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>State Standardized Testing Begs the Question: Whose Standard?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some advocates of homeschooling regulation suggest that requiring regular standardized testing of homeschoolers would be a reasonable compromise. In her law review article, Professor Bartholet recommends: “Testing of homeschoolers on a regular basis, at least annually, to assess educational progress, with tests selected and administered by public school authorities; permission to continue homeschooling conditioned on adequate performance, with low scores triggering an order to enroll in school.”</p>
<p>During Monday’s debate, I asked the question: By whose standard are we judging homeschoolers’ academic performance? Is it by the standard of the government schools, where so many children are failing to meet the very academic standards the government has created? I pointed out that many parents choose homeschooling because they disapprove of the standards set by government schools. For example, in recent years schools have pushed literacy expectations to younger and younger children, with kindergarteners now being required to read. If they fail to meet this arbitrary standard, many children are labeled with a reading deficiency when it could just be that they are not yet developmentally ready to read.</p>
<p>Indeed, as The New York Times reported in 2015: “Once mainly concentrated among religious families as well as parents who wanted to release their children from the strictures of traditional classrooms, home schooling is now attracting parents who want to escape the testing and curriculums that have come along with the Common Core, new academic standards that have been adopted by more than 40 states.”</p>
<p>A key benefit of homeschooling is avoiding standardization in learning and allowing for a much more individualized education. And it seems to be working. Most of the research on homeschooling families conducted over the past several decades, including a recent literature review by Dr. Lindsey Burke of the Heritage Foundation, finds positive academic outcomes of homeschooling children.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Homeschoolers Will Win</li>
</ol>
<p>There are very few movements today that bring together such a diverse group of people as homeschooling does. Families of all political persuasions, from all corners of the country, reflecting many different races, ethnicities, classes, cultures, values, and ideologies, and representing a multitude of different learning philosophies and approaches choose homeschooling for the educational freedom and flexibility it provides. Homeschoolers may not agree on much, but preserving the freedom to raise and educate their children as they choose is a unifying priority. In times of division, homeschoolers offer hope and optimism that liberty will prevail.

Advertisement Hedge funds entered 2020 on a bit of a roll. The Preqin All-Strategies Hedge Fund benchmark delivered an 11.45% return in 2019 – only the second time the industry has registered double-digit returns since the beginning of 2014. The pressure was on to repeat the performance in 2020. But COVID-19 hit, and all bets were off. Billionaires and hedge funds with billions in assets have spent the first part of the year trimming or completely exiting positions. As we&rsquo;ve said in looking at billionaires&rsquo; top stock picks, it&rsquo;s both interesting and constructive to know what the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; is doing. That&rsquo;s because they boast rich resources and deep connections to insiders that can give them insights into stock picks that most other people simply don&rsquo;t have. It can be equally instructive to look at what they&rsquo;re unloading, and why. Here are 25 stocks that billionaires have been selling so far in 2020. Many of those sales were stocks most likely to be affected by the virus: airlines, hotels, retailers, restaurants, casinos and other businesses that can&rsquo;t make money without people physically visiting their establishments or utilizing their services. In some cases, however, the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; prudently took profits on holdings that were working quite well for them. And once in a while, you&rsquo;ll find that some billionaires are ditching what other institutional investors covet.</p>

<p>N/A Billionaire investor : David Tepper (Appaloosa Management)</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>David Tepper (Appaloosa Management) Shares sold: 600,000 (-46%) David Tepper, the billionaire owner of the Carolina Panthers and the manager of hedge fund Appaloosa Management, sold 46% of Botox maker Allergan during the first quarter, reducing its weighting in the Appaloosa portfolio from 6.2% at the end of December to 3.8% at the end of March, but it remained the firm&rsquo;s seventh-largest holding. Tepper wasn&rsquo;t the only smart-money manager to sell off a large chunk of AGN. John Paulson&rsquo;s Paulson &amp; Co. shed roughly 2.1 million shares, or 77% of its stake, during the first quarter. Of course, Allergan shares don&rsquo;t exist anymore. On May 8, biopharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) closed its $62 billion deal to buy AGN after clearing U.S. antitrust hurdles, creating a combined entity that should generate $50 billion in annual revenues. &ldquo;The new AbbVie will be a well-diversified leader in many important therapeutic categories, with both on-market and pipeline assets, and our financial strength will allow us to continue to invest in innovative science and continue to serve unmet medical needs of patients that rely upon us,&rdquo; AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez said upon the deal closing. &ldquo;I am proud of both organizations and look forward to the opportunities ahead.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s notable about the deal is that Allergan shareholders received $120.30 in cash and 0.8660 shares of ABBV for every share held. So it appears that Tepper and Paulson alike held onto some of their Allergan stock to roll into AbbVie. We&rsquo;ll see if they maintained those stakes when they report their second-quarter 13Fs, which should happen in August.</p>

<p>$1.27 trillion Billionaire investo r: Peter Woo (Wharf Holdings)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>r: Peter Woo (Wharf Holdings) Shares sold: 223,452 (-100%) Hong Kong real estate billionaire Peter Woo is worth an estimated $13.3 billion. On May 25, Wharf Holdings – a 73%-owned subsidiary of Wheelock Properties, a holding company controlled by the billionaire – announced it had sold 223,452 shares of Amazon.com (AMZN, $2,545.02). Wharf&rsquo;s announcement stated that it had sold Amazon shares between Aug. 5, 2019, and May 22, 2020, at an average price of $1,975 per share. Based on an average price paid of $1,083, Wharf was locking in an 82% profit on its investment in the e-commerce giant. The sales totaled more than $440 million, which is no small sum. However, Wharf Holdings wasn&rsquo;t a huge owner; had it held on to its stake, it would have ranked as the company&rsquo;s 175th-largest shareholder. Woo announced in February plans to take Wheelock Properties private, offering to buy the holding company&rsquo;s stock he doesn&rsquo;t already own for HK$12 per share. As part of the offer, Wheelock would distribute to its shareholders the company&rsquo;s ownership interest in Wharf Holdings and its sister company, Wharf REIC, which have a market value of HK$124 billion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a win-win-win situation for all three businesses, given the current situation that the global economy finds itself,&rdquo; Justin Tang, head of Asian research at broker dealer United First Partners, said about the privatization. &ldquo;Once this coronavirus (outbreak) clears, the Hong Kong protests might start again, so minority investors may think this (is) a good bail out deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>$67.0 billion Billionaire investor : Chris Hohn (TCI Fund Management)</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Chris Hohn (TCI Fund Management) Shares sold: 3,138,793 (-78%) TCI Fund Management, which is short for The Children&rsquo;s Investment Management, is a U.K. investment advisor and hedge fund run by billionaire investor Chris Hohn. TCI managed more than $30 billion for clients heading into 2020 and destroyed the hedge fund competition in 2019, generating a 41% return. That&rsquo;s almost four times the hedge fund average. In TCI&rsquo;s March 31 13F filing, TCI revealed it had sold 78% of its holdings in health insurance plan provider Anthem (ANTM, $265.74), reducing its remaining holdings to about $170 million, or just 0.81% of the $21.1 billion listed in its 13F. Anthem was a recent purchase, with TCI Fund Management entering its stake in the second quarter of 2019. The same quarter, it launched a pharmacy benefits manager, IngenioRx. During the first quarter of 2020, the PBM generated $5.2 billion in revenue and operating profits of $349 million. Investors can expect this segment of its business to grow dramatically. TCI might not have made much of a profit on ANTM, however; even if it sold at the Q1 2020 peak, Hohn would&rsquo;ve enjoyed a 14% gain in that case – but depending on when it sold, it might have yielded a smaller return or even losses. TCI made several sales throughout the quarter, including complete exits of stakes in TransDigm Group (TDG) and Northrop Grumman (NOC). In case you&rsquo;re wondering about Hohn&rsquo;s favorite stocks, two of his top five are Canadian railroads: Canadian Pacific (CP) and Canadian National Railway (CNI), which combined account for over $4 billion in assets.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>Nelson Peltz (Trian Fund Management) Shares sold: 2,453,278 (-20%) Trian Fund Management, run by billionaire Nelson Peltz, wasn&rsquo;t alone in reducing its position in banking and global investments giant Bank of New York Mellon (BK, $38.44) during the first quarter. A total of 369 institutions, including 55 hedge funds, cut bait on the company. Trian reduced its ownership by 20% in the first three months of the year to 9.7 million shares. But BK remains Trian&rsquo;s sixth-largest holding, at 4.7% of the $6.9 billion equity portfolio. It sits behind more Peltz-like holdings including Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Sysco (SYY) and Mondelez (MDLZ). Like most financial companies, Bank of New York Mellon has had a miserable 2020. BK shares are off 23.6% year-to-date – about a percentage point behind the broader financial sector, as measured by the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF). It&rsquo;s likely Peltz was trying to lock in some of the gains earned since Trian entered the position during Q1 2014. An interesting note: In June, the SEC awarded $50 million to a former Bank of New York Mellon trader who tipped off the commission about the bank overcharging large clients on currency trades. The award is the single-largest in the history of the whistleblower program.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates (Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust) Shares sold: 5,000,000 (-10%) The bad news (if you&rsquo;re Warren Buffett): During the first quarter of 2020, Bill and Melinda Gates&rsquo; foundation sold 5 million shares of Buffett&rsquo;s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $181.21). The good news: While that sounds like a large number, the foundation still held 44.9 million shares as of the end of the first quarter. That 1.8% stake in Berkshire Hathaway still makes up 47% of the foundation&rsquo;s assets, so clearly Bill and Melinda Gates haven&rsquo;t soured on the Oracle of Omaha. This is a great example of why it pays to look further into billionaire stock sales and purchases. The Gates Foundation&rsquo;s transaction was part of a planned sale set up in 2017. The foundation said that over a roughly three-year period, it would sell 60 million shares of Berkshire stock that Warren Buffett had donated as part of his 2006 commitment to give away close to 100% of his wealth to charity. &ldquo;In my entire lifetime, everything that I&rsquo;ve spent will be quite a bit less than 1% of everything I make. The other 99%-plus will go to others because it has no utility to me,&rdquo; Buffett said at the time. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s silly for me to not transfer that utility to people who can use it.&rdquo; The less privileged have benefited from Buffett&rsquo;s grand gesture ever since.</p>

<p>$106.9 billion Billionaire investor : Marshall Wace North America LP</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Marshall Wace North America LP Shares sold: 1,304,102 (-99%) London-based investment advisor Marshall Wace got its start in 1997. As of 2019, it managed $39 billion in assets. It brought on KKR &amp; Co. (KKR) as a 25% partner in 2015 and has since pumped that percentage up to 40%. Following the paper trail for Marshall Wace takes a bit of patience. That&rsquo;s because it has two 13F forms. One is for Marshall Wace LLP. The other is for Marshall Wace North America LP. Together, they had assets of $23.2 billion at the end of March that were invested across a few thousand stocks. Marshall Wace North America was one of numerous institutional investors to shed Boeing (BA, $189.51) stock during the first quarter of 2020. It sold off roughly 1.3 million Boeing shares during the first quarter, reducing its stake – which it initiated in Q1 2017 – to a mere 6,718 shares. It has paid an average price of $360.59 per share. But it likely did most of the selling in March, when BA fell from $275 at the end of February to a low of $95 by the third week of March. Boeing stock finished the quarter around $149 per share, well down from where it started 2020. Also, Marshall Wace LLP sold 15,849 shares, or 66% of its holdings, to finish March with a little more than 8,000 shares. While BA shares have recovered somewhat in Q2, the company still has a long road ahead of it. In April, Boeing reported a $641 million loss and plans to permanently cut 10% of its workforce.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>Dan Loeb (Third Point LLC) Shares sold: 5,000,000 (-100%) Activist investor Dan Loeb&rsquo;s firm exited several positions during the first quarter – a three-month period that saw Third Point&rsquo;s investments lose 16% of their value. One of those was Boston Scientific (BSX, $35.35). The medical device company previously accounted for 2.6% of Third Point&rsquo;s portfolio, the 14th-largest position at the time. It first acquired BSX shares during the first quarter of 2019 at an average price of $38.80 per share, making it likely that Third Point made a small profit or broke even over the past year. May was a busy month for Boston Scientific. It raised $2 billion by doing preferred and common stock offerings concurrently. The common offering sold 29.4 million shares, with an option to buy 3.8 million more, at $34.25 a share. The preferred offering sold 10.1 million shares, including an over-allotment option of 1.3 million shares, of 5.5% convertible mandatory preferreds at $100 each. BSX intends to use some of the proceeds to repay the $750 million that was outstanding on its credit facility due in April 2021. The rest goes toward general corporate purposes. Third Point&rsquo;s largest position is Baxter International (BAX), another medical equipment company that made up 15% of the portfolio as of the end of Q1 2020. But it didn&rsquo;t escape the scythe, either – Third Point sold 5.9 million shares, or 33% of its stake in BAX, during the first quarter.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>Bill Ackman (Pershing Square Capital) Shares sold: 563,078 (-32%) Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman sold more than half a million shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG, $991.83) in the month of February at prices between $859.62 and $893.42. That was roughly a third of Ackman&rsquo;s position, but he remains a top-10 investor in CMG with about 1.2 million shares, or a roughly 4.2% stake. But don&rsquo;t think this is a sign of bearishness on Ackman&rsquo;s part. It&rsquo;s still likely one of his favorite stocks. For one, Ackman was just prudently taking some profits on a stock he first started accumulating in Q3 2016, at an estimated average price of $386.20 per share. In fact, Ackman wanted to buy Chipotle stock in March when it fell to $465 but was unable to do so because Pershing Square has a person sitting on the restaurant chain&rsquo;s board. He called his hamstringing &ldquo;the only big frustration&rdquo; of the first quarter. One other big sale by the hedge fund came in May, when Pershing Square unloaded its $1 billion investment in Berkshire Hathaway to raise cash to put to work in case the markets corrected again. That came after Pershing actually upped its investment in BRK.B during Q1, adding 1.4 million shares to the 4.02 million it held at the end of 2019. An additional reason for unloading Berkshire stock: Ackman was disappointed that Buffett didn&rsquo;t put its big cash hoard to use over the year he owned BRK.B.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>3G Capital Shares sold: 4,094,556 (-100%) 3G Capital, for those unaware, is the Brazilian private equity firm that has made huge, leveraged acquisitions in consumer favorites such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), Restaurant Brands International&rsquo;s (QSR) Burger King and Kraft Heinz (KHC). It manages more than $26 billion in assets for clients. The first quarter of 2020 saw 3G exit several communications investments, including Comcast (CMCSA, $39.46). It first acquired shares in CMCSA during the first quarter of 2018 at an average price paid of $38.63. Thus, 3G likely made money on its investment, but not as much as you&rsquo;d like to have earned over a four-year investment. Comcast stock was downgraded to Neutral (equivalent of Hold) in mid-May by Guggenheim analyst Mike McCormack. The analyst feels NBCUniversal will face major headwinds for the remainder of the year due to COVID-19 affecting revenues at its theme parks, filmed entertainment and advertising. 3G also sold out the hedge fund&rsquo;s position in Fox A Class (FOXA) and Fox B Class (FOX) shares, as well as Charter Communications (CHTR) during Q1. Its largest position is now Carvana (CVNA), an online used car retailer that makes up 17.6% of the equity portfolio.</p>

<p>Greenlight Capital Shares sold: 677,000 (-100%) David Einhorn&rsquo;s Greenlight Capital was the third-biggest seller of EchoStar (SATS, $30.28) stock in the first quarter behind Putnam Investments and Thornburg Investment Management. Greenlight completely exited its position in EchoStar and six other stakes in Q1. The biggest splash of those sales was Einhorn&rsquo;s exit from a 6.1-million-share position in General Motors (GM). As for EchoStar, Greenlight entered the satellite communications and internet services provider during the fourth quarter of 2018. The hedge fund paid an average share price of $37.55 for the provider of satellite broadband services. If Einhorn was able to exit the position early in the first quarter when it was trading near $43, Greenlight would have made a tidy profit. If he sold closer to mid-March, when SATS was trading below $27, he might have suffered a considerable loss. EchoStar recorded a 2% increase in first-quarter sales to $465.7 million, but operating income plunged 62% to $10.6 million. As for Einhorn? He has had a rough year, with his Greenlight Capital funds down 16.6% through the end of May.</p>

<p>Peter Woo (Wharf Holdings) Shares sold: 2,576,491 (-100%) Facebook (FB, $228.58) was the second of Wharf Holdings&rsquo; FAANG sales. The company announced May 25 that it sold almost 2.6 million shares of Facebook stock at an average selling price of $195. As with Amazon, it sold the shares on several occasions between Aug. 5, 2019, and May 21, 2020, for net proceeds of $503 million. Given that Wharf Holdings paid an average of $175.82 a share, that translates into a less-than-impressive 11% return. Still, the gains reaped from both Amazon and Facebook might make his Wheelock Properties empire more attractive as he privatizes the firm. Facebook itself is having one heckuva year, up 11.4% year-to-date versus a nearly 6% loss for the broader markets.</p>

<p>Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway) Shares sold: 10,084,571 (-84%) Warren Buffett has exited several positions in 2020, but he also hacked away at his Goldman Sachs (GS, $201.78) stake. After selling off 84% of its investment, which he initiated in 2013, Berkshire is left with 1.92 million shares worth $387 million – the remaining reminder of Buffett&rsquo;s bailout of the investment bank in 2008. For its $5 billion lifeline, Berkshire received preferred stock that paid a 10% dividend, along with warrants to buy 43.5 million shares of its stock at $115 each. The preferred paid $1.2 billion in dividends in the three years they were outstanding. On top of that, Berkshire received a $500 million premium when Goldman redeemed the preferreds in 2011. The warrants were renegotiated in 2013. Berkshire has bought and sold the stock in the seven years since, but Q1 was a particularly deep cut likely meant to reduce Buffett&rsquo;s exposure to the banking industry. Buffett&rsquo;s most earth-shattering stock sale this year, however, came in early May when Berkshire exited its positions in America&rsquo;s four largest airlines at a loss. Buffett, once opposed to owning airline stocks, bought large stakes in the airlines in 2016 and had held ever since. &ldquo;The airline business changed in a very major way. The future is much less clear to me about how the business will turn out,&rdquo; Buffett said at Berkshire&rsquo;s annual meeting in May.</p>

<p>Lyrical Asset Management Shares sold: 9,203,229 (-98%) Lyrical Asset Management, a fundamental value investor that has been managing money since 2009, manages $7.4 billion for clients, according to WhaleWisdom. And precious little of that is dedicated to Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (GT, $9.42) after Lyrical shed 98% of its stake during the first quarter. At the end of December, Lyrical owned 9.3 million shares that made up roughly 2% of the portfolio. Now it holds just 136,601 shares, which makes up just 0.02%. So, why did it sell? The tire producer&rsquo;s sales and earnings are falling dramatically. Goodyear&rsquo;s sales during the first quarter were $3.06 billion, 15% lower than a year ago. And its 60-cent-per-share adjusted loss was more than double analyst expectations for a 26-cent deficit. It&rsquo;s possible that Lyrical felt Goodyear&rsquo;s business was going to get worse in the second quarter and decided to redeploy the capital elsewhere. Not every billionaire sees Goodyear&rsquo;s glass as half-empty, however. During Q1, David Tepper&rsquo;s Appaloosa established a new position in the tiremaker by purchasing almost 3.4 million shares of GT stock. That&rsquo;s the beauty of the markets: There are two sides to every story.</p>

Of course, in the case of Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ, $2.83), the billionaire swung and he missed – badly. On May 26, Icahn reported to the SEC that two of his affiliated companies (Icahn Partners LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund LP) sold 100% of their holdings in the car rental business at the bargain-basement price of 72 cents a share. As recently as March, Icahn was buying Hertz stock at prices between $7 and $8. Icahn owned 39% of the company&rsquo;s stock at the time of the sale. When it became apparent the company would file for bankruptcy, Icahn had little choice but to recoup whatever he could from the failed investment. &ldquo;Yesterday I sold my equity position at a significant loss, but this does not mean that I don&rsquo;t continue to have faith in the future of Hertz,&rdquo; Icahn said. &ldquo;I believe that based on a plan of reorganization that includes new capital, Hertz will again become a great company.&rdquo; Icahn lost an estimated $2 billion from Hertz, or approximately 14% of his current net worth. Worse? Two weeks after Icahn exited his stake, shares briefly spiked above $6 amid rampant speculation in the stock. Ouch.</p>

Glenview is thought to have gotten into the stock in the fourth quarter of 2018 at an average price of $267.98 a share. During the first three months of the year, Humana&rsquo;s stock traded between a high of $385.00 in February and a low of $208.25 in March. Considering that, and that his remaining stake is now priced at nearly $380 per share, Robbins is likely doing OK on his investment, which remains the fund&rsquo;s 12th-largest position. On May 29, Humana filed a disclosure report with the SEC that in its meetings with investors in June, the company will reaffirm its guidance for full-year adjusted earnings of $18.50 at the midpoint. That hasn&rsquo;t changed from its guidance at the end of April despite the ongoing uncertainty caused by COVID-19. On June 5, Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Jones initiated coverage of Humana with a Buy rating and a 12-month price target of $510. The analyst believes the company&rsquo;s Medicare Advantage business will continue to gain market share, resulting in multiple expansion in the future for Humana&rsquo;s stock. While Humana remains widely held among the hedge fund crowd, 315 investment firms filing a 13F reduced their HUM holdings during the first quarter, versus just 73 that added to them. The jury&rsquo;s still out.</p>

<dd>
<p>Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb Shares sold: 1,378,084 (-24%) If you own shares of Jacobs Engineering (J, $80.49), don&rsquo;t be too dismayed by Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb&rsquo;s considerable stock sale in Q1 2020. Yes, the disposal of almost 1.4 million shares was one of the hedge fund&rsquo;s largest sales during the first quarter. But on a positive note, the global provider of engineering and construction services remains Ruane, Cunniff&rsquo;s seventh-largest holding at 5.4% of the portfolio. Besides, Ruane, Cuniff has paid an estimated $49.74 per share for Jacobs&rsquo; stock since initiating the position in Q4 2012. Given that J shares traded above $100 as recently as late February, it&rsquo;s easy to understand why the smart money took some profits during Q1. And in fact, given that the stock is trading close to $80 at the moment, any additional weakness might result in further profit-taking. Also take heart in the company&rsquo;s operational results. Q1 revenues grew 10.9% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, and adjusted earnings rose 12% to $186 million. And on May 6, the company said it expects fiscal 2020&rsquo;s adjusted earnings to reach $4.80 per share – a modest 5% decline that seems fortunate considering the pandemic&rsquo;s fiercer hits to other parts of the economy.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>Marshall Wace LLP Shares sold: 2,746,985 (-85%) During the first quarter of 2020, Marshall Wace LLP sold 2,746,985 shares of Pfizer (PFE, $33.75), which represented 85% of its holdings in the drug company. But its North American counterpart also ditched a large slug of its Pfizer holdings, selling more than 3.4 million shares representing 42% of its holdings. Thus, together, the two entities sold nearly 6.2 million PFE shares during Q1, reducing its overall stake in the company by 55%. Marshall Wace LLP first added Pfizer to the portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016, paying an average price of $37.90 a share. Marshall Wace North America LP first added Pfizer to the portfolio in Q1 2017, paying $37.38 on average. Pfizer&rsquo;s stock traded as high as $40.97 in January and as low as $27.88 in March, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that Marshall Wace made much money from its latest sales. Longtime shareholders can likely relate to that lack of reward. Over the past five years, Pfizer has a total return of 3.4%, less than half the total return of the U.S. markets as a whole.</p>

<dd>
<p>John Paulson (Paulson &amp; Co.) Shares sold: 2,425,770 (-56%) John Paulson, worth $4.2 billion at last check, cut his hedge fund&rsquo;s ownership position in SPDR Gold Shares (GLD, $162.62) by 56% in the first quarter, lowering its ownership in the gold exchange-traded fund to about 1.9 million shares. Gold lovers, fear not: GLD remains Paulson&rsquo;s third-largest position. When you consider that gold prices are up about 26% over the past 52 weeks, it&rsquo;s understandable that Paulson took some of his hedge fund&rsquo;s gold exposure off the table. It&rsquo;s especially understandable when you consider that Paulson made a big bet on gold back in the Great Recession with middling results. Gold got as high as $1,921 in 2011 before falling back to earth when the expected surge in inflation failed to materialize, putting a dent in his hedge fund&rsquo;s performance. Perhaps he fears the same thing will happen in 2020. Another billionaire that isn&rsquo;t afraid of gold is Bridgewater Associates&rsquo; Ray Dalio. His hedge fund owns more than $600 million of GLD, making the ETF his second-largest position.</p>

<p>Ray Dalio (Bridgewater Associates) Shares sold: 3,425,622 (-49%) Speaking of Dalio, he took a massive chunk out of his largest holding during Q1. His Bridgewater Associates sold nearly half of its holdings in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY, $304.21) – an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. Even after those sales, the S&amp;P 500 tracker remained Bridgewater&rsquo;s largest holding at 18.2% of the fund. Bridgewater sold out of several other ETFs in Q1. It dropped 43% of its holdings in the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO, $39.38), which remains its second-largest holding at 9.2% of assets. Dalio also cast off 41% of his stake in the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV), another S&amp;P 500 tracker that still is his fourth-largest holding at 6.6% of assets. These three low-cost funds account for more than a third of Bridgewater&rsquo;s portfolio. The rest is spread among 647 stocks and funds. WhaleWisdom data shows that 919 financial institutions reduced their holdings in SPY during the first quarter, including 133 hedge funds. Moreover, 186 financial institutions closed out their positions entirely; 57 of those were hedge funds.</p>

Cooperman had held United since the fourth quarter of 2013 and is estimated to have paid an average of $53.10 per share. in the first quarter, long before Warren Buffett decided to exit his airline stocks. If so, Omega Advisors lost a significant amount from its investment. Cooperman&rsquo;s hedge fund is said to manage $4.3 billion for clients. According to its 13F from December, UAL was the fourth-largest holding out of 60 stocks; only the hedge fund&rsquo;s investments in Fiserv (FISV), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cigna (CI) were larger. Cooperman is said to be worth $3.2 billion, according to Forbes. That number likely would be higher if it weren&rsquo;t for United.</p>

And during the first quarter, it exited a number of stakes, including in VF Corp. (VFC, $61.25), the apparel conglomerate best known for its Vans, The North Face and Timberland brands. Winslow hadn&rsquo;t owned VFC for very long. It picked up VF Corp.&lsquo;s stock during the second quarter of 2019, paying an average of $90.61 per share. VFC has traded below that ever since its fiscal Q3 earnings report in late January. The company cut its full-year forecast thanks to declining demand for its Timberland brand and slowing growth at Vans. Of note to long-time shareholders: In December 2018, John E. Barbey Jr. – the son of the company&rsquo;s founder – died at the age of 102. In February 2019, trustees for Barbey&rsquo;s will reported that Barbey&rsquo;s various trusts owned 68.4 million shares of VFC stock at the end of 2018, representing 17.24% of its stock. On Feb. 7, 2020, the trusts reported that the shares shares owned had dropped to 39.7 million, representing 9.96% of VF Corp.&lsquo;s stock. Before too long, that stake might disappear from history.</p>

<p>Richard Branson (Vieco 10) Shares sold: 34,925,000 (-31%) On May 14, Vieco 10, a subsidiary of Richard Branson&rsquo;s Virgin Group, reported that it owned more than 112 million shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE, $14.99), the Branson-founded commercial space travel company. The billionaire has pursued this dream for years. It officially got underway in September 2004, when Virgin Galactic Airways was launched to much fanfare, and it went public in October 2019. Originally, Virgin Galactic&rsquo;s management expected commercial spaceflight operations to begin in June 2020, but that timeline has been pushed back by COVID-19. In the meantime, many of Branson&rsquo;s hospitality businesses, which include Virgin Atlantic Airlines, have been severely hurt by the pandemic, forcing Branson to sell SPCE stock to help his other businesses survive during these troubling times. On May 22, Vieco 10 reported that it had sold 22.4 million shares of Virgin Galactic stock, lowering its ownership stake from 53.3% to 42.7%. Then in June, it was reported that Branson was to sell up to 12.5 million shares through Credit Suisse at $15.30 per share. A June 5 regulatory filing showed that Vieco 10 was down to 77,290,438 shares, implying a stake of 36.7%. Branson had said that he would sell $500 million in stock. The recent sales have hit that target, so we&rsquo;ll see if any more take place in the future. Despite these recent moves, Branson still is by far the largest owner of Virgin Galactic&rsquo;s stock.</p>

<p>Larry Robbins (Glenview Capital Management) Shares sold: 2,088,178 (-100%) The house that Walt built wasn&rsquo;t one of Glenview Capital&rsquo;s top 10 holdings starting out the year, but Walt Disney (DIS, $115.49) nonetheless represented a healthy 2.6% chunk of the fund&rsquo;s assets. That was before Glenview opted to exit the stake, likely after seeing how devastating COVID-19 would be on Disney&rsquo;s operations. Of all the investment firms that sold 100% of their Disney holdings in the first quarter, Glenview sold the second-largest number of shares. It trailed only Oslo-based Norges Bank, which unloaded 17.7 million shares. Robbins, who is worth almost $2 billion, tends to swing wildly between sprinting past the stock market and eating its dust. Through the first three months of 2020, Glenview is down 30.5%, which includes a 19.5% decline in March alone. It likely recovered some of those losses in April and May. In 2019, however, Glenview delivered a 26.3% return that dwarfed the hedge fund community. On June 4, Miller Tabak chief market strategist Mark Maley suggested that if Disney&rsquo;s share price falls to $100, investors should back up the truck. If it gets to $100, you would think Robbins would consider renewing a position in the entertainment giant.</p>

<p>Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner Shares sold: 11,143,204 (-88%) Tom Russo&rsquo;s firm manages almost $10 billion in assets for clients. And during the first quarter, Russo decided that those assets would be better spent elsewhere than Wells Fargo (WFC, $27.97), chopping 88% of Gardner Russo&rsquo;s stake. Gardner Russo&rsquo;s exit represented only the fourth-largest sale of WFC shares during the quarter. Interestingly, the No. 1 spot again goes to Norges Bank, which sold more than 40 million shares. Wells Fargo easily was its biggest offloading of the first quarter. WFC went from being 5.2% of the portfolio to just 0.4%. Gardner Russo also exited 83% of its stake in Altria (MO), but that position represented less than 1% of assets at the end of 2019. On June 2, news surfaced that Wells Fargo, one of the largest lenders for auto loans in the U.S., will stop making loans to independent auto dealerships. That&rsquo;s an about-face from its earlier growth in the space; the bank grew its auto loans by 19% in the first quarter, to $6.5 billion. Wells Fargo had &ldquo;an obligation to review our business practices in light of the economic uncertainty presented by COVID-19 and have let the majority of our independent dealer customers know that we will suspend accepting applications from them,&rdquo; Natalie Brown, a spokeswoman, said in an email to CNBC. WFC shares are having a miserable year, off 48% year-to-date – more than double the financial sector&rsquo;s losses in 2020.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-5e4fe355f911c807c41eb036.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cropped-FAVICON-TEMPLATE_CE-1-32x32.png" alt="img">
New Giving USA report shows strength of Americans’ charitable support and provides baseline, context for current uncertain philanthropic environment</p>
<p>American individuals, bequests, foundations and corporations gave an estimated $449.64 billion to U.S. charities in 2019, placing it among the highest years ever for charitable giving, according to findings in Giving USA 2020: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2019, released today.</p>
<p>Total charitable giving rose 4.2% measured in current dollars (2.4% adjusted for inflation) over the revised total of $431.43 billion contributed in 2018. Measured in current dollars, giving in 2019 reached the highest dollar total to date. Adjusted for inflation, total giving reached the second highest level on record, just slightly below the all-time high dollar amount achieved in 2017. (Please see below for a more detailed breakdown of the numbers for each philanthropic source and sector.)</p>
<p>Giving USA, the longest-running and most comprehensive report of its kind in America, is published by Giving USA Foundation, a public service initiative of The Giving Institute. It is researched and written by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at IUPUI.</p>
<p>“The solid growth of giving in 2019 brought total giving close to the record level set in 2017, which means that the past three years are the three highest years on record. Clearly, Americans prioritize generosity as a key part of their lives,” said Rick Dunham, chair of Giving USA Foundation and founder and CEO of Dunham + Company. “Giving increased substantially in 2019, ending the decade on a high note. While it’s too soon to tell what that will mean in the uncharted territory we all find ourselves in today, these estimates provide an important baseline for understanding where giving stood at the outset of the current crisis. As importantly, Giving USA’s decades of data provide insight into how giving trends have been changing in recent years, offering context in these uncertain times.”</p>
<p>Positive economic conditions resulted in growth in giving from three out of the four sources. Economic growth also led to increases in giving to all but one of the nine major types of recipient charitable organizations. Six of nine of these charitable subsectors reached their highest ever totals in 2019, adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>“In 2019, the growth in total giving was driven by an increase in giving by individuals, which remains by far the biggest source of giving. Interestingly, in recent years we’ve seen a consistent and growing trend in giving by foundations comprising a larger share of total giving than it did 15 years ago,” said Amir Pasic, Ph.D., the Eugene R. Tempel Dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. “This change may reflect larger trends such as in the distribution of wealth and in asset growth across a decade of stock market expansion.”</p>
<p>The overall U.S. economy was relatively strong in 2019, lifted by the robust performance of many of the economic factors that affect giving, such as a 28.9% increase in the S&amp;P 500 and 4.1% growth in the GDP, both in current dollars. Giving by individuals and giving by corporations were buoyed by the growth in the stock market. Giving by foundations also grew, but at a slightly lower rate.</p>
<p>“Donors’ giving patterns evolve in response to changes in economic and social forces. In 2019, we saw solid, broad-based growth in almost all aspects of charitable giving, and especially in giving by individuals due to strong growth in the S&amp;P 500 and personal income,” said Una Osili, Ph.D., associate dean for research and international programs at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. “While giving trends vary by donors’ income and wealth, since the Great Recession, we have seen giving become more concentrated toward the top end of the income and wealth spectrum. We will continue to monitor how current events affect giving patterns.”</p>
<p>Highlights and Numbers for 2019 Charitable Giving by Source:</p>
<p>↑ Giving by individuals totaled an estimated $309.66 billion, rising 4.7% in 2019 (an increase of 2.8%, adjusted for inflation). Giving by individuals achieved the second-highest total dollar amount on record, adjusted for inflation, and was less than 70% of total giving for only the second time ever.</p>
<p>↑ Giving by foundations increased 2.5%, to an estimated $75.69 billion in 2019 (a flat growth rate of 0.7%, adjusted for inflation), reaching its highest-ever dollar amount. Giving by foundations has grown in nine of the last 10 years, and represented 17% of total giving for the second year in a row, the largest share on record. Data on giving by foundations are provided by Candid.</p>
<p>= Giving by bequest was an estimated $43.21 billion in 2019, and was essentially flat with a growth rate of 0.2% from 2018 (a decline of 1.6%, adjusted for inflation). Giving by bequest often fluctuates substantially from year to year.</p>
<p>↑ Giving by corporations is estimated to have increased by 13.4% in 2019, totaling $21.09 billion (an increase of 11.4%, adjusted for inflation). This significant growth is indicative of this type of giving, which is highly responsive to changes in corporate pre-tax profits and GDP, and its year-over-year trend lines tend to be more turbulent as a result.</p>
<p>“It is encouraging to see that not only did America’s corporate and foundation contributions increase, but also that its citizens continue to account for the substantial majority of giving,” said Ted Grossnickle, chair of The Giving Institute, and senior consultant and founder of Johnson, Grossnickle + Associates.</p>
<p>“In 2019, giving to nearly all of the subsectors grew, reflecting the wide interests and causes that Americans care about,” said Laura MacDonald, vice-chair of Giving USA Foundation and founder of Benefactor Group. “With the growth in giving from donor-advised funds, planned giving programs, and the evolution to online giving platforms and giving days, there are more varied opportunities than there were 10 years ago for nonprofits to engage with current and prospective donors.”</p>
<p>Highlights and Numbers for 2019 Charitable Giving to Recipients:</p>
<p>↑ Giving to religion increased 2.3% between 2018 and 2019, with an estimated $128.17 billion in contributions. Adjusted for inflation, giving to religion was essentially flat, increasing 0.5% in 2019.</p>
<p>↑ Giving to education is estimated to have increased 12.1%, to $64.11 billion. Adjusted for inflation, giving to education organizations increased 10.1%.</p>
<p>↑ Giving to human services increased by an estimated 5.0% in 2019, totaling $55.99 billion. Adjusted for inflation, giving to human services organizations increased by 3.1%.</p>
<p>↑ Giving to foundations is estimated to have increased by 2.5% in 2019, to $53.51 billion. Adjusted for inflation, giving to foundations was essentially flat, increasing 0.6%.</p>
<p>↑ Giving to health organizations is estimated to have increased by 6.8% to $41.46 billion, an increase of 4.9%, adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>↑ Giving to public-society benefit organizations increased an estimated 13.1%, to $37.16 billion. Adjusted for inflation, giving to public-society benefit organizations grew 11.1%.</p>
<p>= Giving to international affairs is estimated to be $28.89 billion in 2019, staying relatively flat compared to 2018 with a decline of 0.4%. Adjusted for inflation, giving to international affairs organizations declined 2.2%, after two strong years of growth.</p>
<p>↑ Giving to arts, culture, and humanities is estimated to have increased 12.6% to $21.64 billion. Adjusted for inflation, giving to the arts, culture, and humanities subsector increased 10.6%.</p>
<p>↑ Giving to environment and animal organizations is estimated to have increased 11.3%, to $14.16 billion. Adjusted for inflation, giving to the environment/animals subsector increased 9.4%. This marks the category’s sixth consecutive year of growth.</p>
<p>“Giving to education, to arts, culture and humanities organizations, to public-society benefit organizations, and environment and animal organizations all saw double-digit growth in 2019, even when adjusted for inflation,” said Patrick M. Rooney, Ph.D., executive associate dean for academic programs at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. “The 2019 results for recipient organizations are in line with the trends we have seen over time. Generally speaking, when there is broad-based economic growth, it is reflected in increased giving to all of the various subsectors; however, giving to religion is usually the least affected by economic shifts.”</p>
<p>Giving to individuals, which is 2% of total giving, is estimated to have increased 2.2% (0.4% in inflation-adjusted dollars) in 2019, to $10.11 billion. The bulk of these donations are in-kind gifts of medications to patients in need, made through the patient assistance programs of pharmaceutical companies’ operating foundations.</p>
<p>Unallocated giving was -$5.54 billion in 2019. This amount can be considered the difference between giving by source and recipient subsector in a particular year. It includes the difference between itemized deductions by individuals (and households) carried over from previous years. The tax year in which a gift is claimed by the donor (carried over) and the year when the recipient organization reports it as revenue (the year in which it is received) may be different.</p>

Data for giving by foundations come from Candid (formerly the Foundation Center).</p>
<p>Following the same approach used by leading public and private institutions that develop economic statistics, Giving USA researchers update data found within Giving USA each year. This is because current Giving USA estimates are developed before final tax data, some economic indicators and some demographic data are available. The estimates are revised and updated as final versions of these data become available. Final estimates are usually developed two or three years after their initial release.</p>

<h3 id="covid-policies-drive-national-debt-to-all-time-record-for-highest-portion-of-us-economy">&ldquo;COVID Policies Drive National Debt to All-Time Record for Highest Portion of US Economy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://fee.org/content/images/favicon.ico" alt="img">
The US national debt has just reached 120.5 percent of the nation’s annual economic output, breaking a record set in 1946 for the highest debt level in the history of the United States. The previous extreme of 118.4 percent stemmed from World War II, the deadliest and most widespread conflict in world history.</p>
<p>Today’s unprecedented debt-to-economy ratio—which is economists’ primary measure of government debt—includes $2.5 trillion in new debt since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it doesn’t account for the vast bulk of economic damage inflicted by government-mandated business shutdowns, which will soon make the debt ratio significantly larger by decreasing its denominator. Although this decline has already begun, most of it is not yet reflected in the official data on the size of the US economy.</p>
<p>Unlike the debt from World War II—which rapidly fell once the war ended—the modern national debt has been on a steep upward path for decades. The main driver of this has been increased government spending on social programs, which grew from 20 percent of federal expenses in 1959 to 62 percent in 2018. Without substantial reforms, social spending will increase further and drive the debt to levels that dwarf the debt from World War II.</p>
<p>Contrary to claims that government debt isn’t a major problem, a broad range of facts show that it can have serious negative consequences, such as lower wages, weak economic growth, increased inflation, higher taxes, reduced government benefits, or combinations of such results. These, in turn, impair people’s quality of life and can reduce their life expectancy. Some of these impacts may have already begun.</p>
<p>Measuring the National Debt</p>
<p>The US Treasury’s official figure for the debt of the federal government on June 15, 2020 is $26,131,295,159,192. This measure of raw debt has grown through most of the nation’s history, but it overstates the scale of debt over time because it doesn’t account for inflation, population increases, or economic growth. These factors allow governments to carry more debt with less harm than if their economies were smaller.</p>
<p>To adjust for such factors across nations and over time, economists and government agencies commonly measure government debt as a portion of each nation’s annual economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP). This accounts for varying population sizes, some effects of inflation, and the capacity of governments to service their debts.</p>
<p>Over the course of US history, the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio has averaged 30.3 percent and has stayed around or below this level except for a massive spike from World War II and during the modern era. The WWII record of 118.4 percent held for the past 74 years but was toppled on May 22, 2020 when it reached 118.5 percent. By the end of May, it had reached 119.5 percent, or four times its average over the nation’s history:</p>
<p>The debt continued growing in early June and reached 120.5 percent by the 8th day of the month. These debt-to-GDP figures are based on the latest available yearly data from the US Treasury and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal agency that calculates official GDP figures.</p>
<p>COVID-19 Responses &amp; Impacts</p>
<p>From the day that the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (March 11) through June 8th, the US national debt rose by $2.5 trillion or 11.5 percentage points of GDP. This was mainly due to:</p>
<p>Four federal bills passed to address the pandemic and buffer the economic fallouts of business shutdowns imposed by state governments. These will cost about $2.5 trillion, or an average of $19,000 for every household in the nation</p>
<p>Lost tax revenue from business shutdowns</p>
<p>Debt increases that were already baked into the federal budget for 2020</p>
<p>Because the latest available GDP data is for the first quarter of 2020, and the business shutdowns didn’t begin until mid-March, they affect only half a month out of a year of data. Thus, the shutdowns have a relatively small effect on the latest annual GDP figure, reducing it by about 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>Also in response to COVID-19 and the shutdowns, the Federal Reserve created trillions of dollars in new money to purchase federal government debt and other financial assets. The effects of such policies don’t necessarily manifest in the national debt but can impact people in other ways.</p>
<p>Systemic Drivers</p>
<p>As with the recent debt increases from the COVID-19-related laws, the national debt has been mainly driven for the past 60 years by social spending, or government programs that provide healthcare, income security, education, nutrition, housing, and cultural services. These programs have grown from 20 percent of all federal spending in 1959 to 62 percent in 2018:</p>
<p>Under current laws and policies, the Congressional Budget Office projects that almost all future growth in debt will be due to increased spending on social programs and interest on the national debt.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many media outlets and politicians have blamed the skyrocketing debt on military spending. In reality, however, military spending has plummeted from 55 percent of all federal expenses in 1959 to 18 percent in 2018. These are comprehensive figures that include standard military expenses, supplemental appropriations like those enacted for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and veteran’s benefits.</p>
<p>Another commonly blamed cause of debt increases is tax cuts, but the fact is that federal tax revenues have stayed roughly level as a portion of GDP for the past 80 years. They commonly declined during recessions and rebounded during recoveries, but the long-term trend has been flat since the 1940s. Before that, tax levels rose dramatically during the Great Depression/New Deal and World War II:</p>
<p>From the era of John F. Kennedy in the 1960s up through Donald Trump, various Congresses and Presidents have enacted a range of tax cuts. However, tax levels have stayed generally stable due to tax increases and a phenomenon called “bracket creep.” This automatically raises people’s tax rates over time because many tax laws are not indexed for income growth and/or inflation. Thus, if tax cuts are not periodically implemented, taxes consume a continually greater share of people’s incomes and the nation’s economy.</p>
<p>For instance, after the Trump tax cuts of 2017 took effect, the Congressional Budget Office projected in 2018 that the portion of the nation’s economy consumed by taxes would rise above its long-term average in several years and then continue on an upward trajectory. Part of this increase is due to the certain expiring provisions of the tax cut in 2026, but the general trend is due to bracket creep:</p>
<p>This comprehensive data reveals that many “tax cuts” were actually “tax evens” because they kept taxes on a relatively flat trend for more than half a century.</p>
<p>Failures to Consider Trajectories</p>
<p>Given that the debt from World War II was by a large margin the highest US debt for more than 220 years, many people have pointed to it as evidence that large national debts don’t harm economies. For example, Douglas J. Amy, professor of politics at Mount Holyoke College, wrote in 2011:</p>
<p>“Conservatives are also wrong when they argue that deficit spending and a large national debt will inevitably undermine economic growth.”</p>
<p>“The best example is World War II when the national debt soared to 120% of GDP—nearly twice the size of today’s debt.”</p>
<p>“This spending not only got us out of the Great Depression but set the stage for a prolonged period of sustained economic growth in the 50s and 60s.”</p>
<p>Forebodingly, the debt exceeded that of WWII in less than a decade, but even before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was on track to grow to more than double the WWII level in the coming three decades. These facts expose the fatal flaw in Amy’s argument—the failure to consider that the WWII debt was a passing spike that plunged after the war, while the modern debt is growing rapidly due to structural issues.</p>
<p>The primary difference between the post-WWII era and today is again, spending. After WWII, federal spending as a portion of GDP fell by 50 percent within two years and averaged 41 percent lower than the last year of the war over the next four decades. In contrast, when Amy wrote the above, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting that under current policies and a sustained economic recovery over the next four decades:</p>
<p>Federal spending would average 72 percent higher than in the four decades that followed WWII</p>
<p>The publicly held debt—a partial measure of the national debt often used by the Congressional Budget Office—would rise by 277 percentage points and grow thereafter to about nine times the peak of WWII:</p>
<p>In the years following that projection, both debt and GDP outcomes were worse than predicted, and the Congressional Budget Office released a more dire projection in 2013. At that time, Barack Obama and Paul Krugman were dismissing concerns about the national debt, and David Lauter and Michael Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times were falsely reporting that debt was falling. Six years later in 2019, the outcome was even worse than projected:</p>
<p>Since 2019, the debt from government responses to COVID-19 has been adding to this, thus steepening its upward trajectory.</p>
<p>All of this has placed the US in a debt situation that is far more critical than at any time in its history. Unlike the WWII era, this is not a passing anomaly but a systemic, escalating problem driven by ongoing federal policies.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>Contrary to those who downplay the dangers of government debt, a broad range of scholarly research has documented the harm it can do:</p>
<p>Writing for the Brookings Institution, Alan J. Auerbach and William G. Gale explain that “sustained large deficits will reduce future national income and living standards.”</p>
<p>The US Government Accountability Office warns that “the costs of federal borrowing will be borne by tomorrow’s workers and taxpayers,” which “may reduce or slow the growth of the living standards of future generations.”</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office reports: “Large budget deficits would reduce national saving, leading to higher interest rates, more borrowing from abroad, and less domestic investment—which in turn would lower income growth in the United States.”</p>
<p>In a book published by Princeton University Press, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff explain: “Governments can also default on domestic public debt through high and unanticipated inflation, as the United States and many European countries famously did in the 1970s.”</p>
<p>A 2012 paper in the Journal of Economic Perspectives documents a strong association and a likely cause-and-effect relationship between high levels of government debt and poor economic growth</p>
<p>Misinforming people about those matters, numerous media outlets publicized a study said to disprove the connection between high debt and weak economic growth, but the study actually shows what previous studies had found: GDP growth decreases by an average of about 30 percent when government debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP. The authors of the study, however, buried this data on the 10th page of their paper and wrote a deceitful overview, which the media parroted.</p>
<p>The consequences of government debt are not merely potential dangers that might occur at some point in the future. They may, in fact, have already begun. Although association does not prove causation, the national debt has risen dramatically over past decades, and with this, the US has experienced episodes of historically poor growth in GDP, productivity, and household income. These could cause a host of negative impacts on human welfare in areas like education, nutrition, healthcare, and life expectancy.</p>
<p>Some people point to Japan, which has a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 200 percent, as evidence that high national debts are harmless. They claim that Japan has not suffered like Greece (which underwent a debt crisis in 2009) because Japan and other nations that have their own currencies “can never run out of money to pay back what they owe, since they can always print what they need as a last resort.”</p>
<p>In reality, Japan has fared as poorly as Greece when measured by the World Bank’s “preferred“ indicator of human welfare, which is people’s consumption of goods and services. The difference is that Japan has experienced long-term sluggish growth in its living standards as its debt has surged, while Greece endured a sudden collapse in living standards when its debt bubble burst. Ultimately, they ended up in about the same place:</p>
<p>Again, association does not prove causation, so these data don’t prove that Japan’s or Greece’s economic woes were caused by debt, but they do debunk the notion that Japan hasn’t suffered like Greece. Japan’s situation may even be worse than Greece’s, for if debt has played a role in Japan’s long-running slump, it is more difficult for citizens to understand this and hold politicians accountable for their actions. Hence, the harmful effects continue.</p>
<p>While some people imagine that governments can borrow with abandon without hurting people, one of the most established laws of economics is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The prolific economist William A. McEachern explains why this is so:
