For someone who’s only 26, PartyNextDoor has seemed on the verge of breaking out for an awfully long time. In 2013, he became the first draft pick to Drake’s OVO sound label, and put out a promising debut LP under his current stage name (PARTYNEXTDOOR). With his deep toolkit (writer, producer, versatile vocalist), beyond-his-years talent, and one of pop music’s most powerful co-signs (the 6 God), fans rightly envisioned big things for him.</p>
<p>The ensuing years haven’t been a failure by any stretch—his subsequent releases have been well received—but if the sky was the limit, Party’s jumped but not flown. Rather than forge his own star-making path—the way popular R&amp;B contemporaries like The Weeknd and Frank Ocean have—his greatest successes have instead helped established stars shine brighter. He’s been an accent to Kanye West (his vocals are on Ye cuts “Ghost Town” and “Wouldn’t Leave”), a hitmaker for Rihanna (crafting “Work,” “Sex With Me,” and DJ Khaled’s Rihanna-featuring “Wild Thoughts”), and a constant muse for Drake.</p>
<p>That last role comes with tradeoffs. Drake often elevates collaborators’ profiles, but he also has been critiqued for occasionally swallowing them whole. The shadow he casts is as long as the one from the CN Tower—and it’s especially hard to break free of it by working in his image, which Party has (for better or worse) often done. Party’s voice—particularly its round Caribbean inflection—is distinct from Drake’s, which is crisper and more nasal. But on past albums, Party has bent his voice in the ways Drake made popular, such that you can practically see a big “6™” stamped next to Party’s attempts at sing-rap fusion. The influence, though, has been particularly pronounced because of Party’s 40-esque productions: where Drake pops against a desaturated backdrop, Party has sometimes blended in.</p>
<p>PARTYMOBILE isn’t completely new territory for Party. 40’s hands are all over the album—his presence especially identifiable on the sound of the album’s early tracks (“The News” is essentially Drake Pastiche). And Drake himself showed up on the album’s first big single, “LOYAL” (and its Bad Bunny-featuring remix). But the album’s great accomplishment is that Party’s own voice comes through more clearly. He’s doing far more singing than rapping; and with each subsequent release it seems you can hear more of his familial roots (he’s Canadian, but his mother is Jamaican and his father Trinidadian).</p>
<p>Most of PARTYMOBILE finds Party crooning about familiar fixations: he’s a sensitive lover who has some regrets (“Trauma”), wants to do better (“SHOWING YOU”), and who has himself been hurt (“NEVER AGAIN”). The vibe and texture doesn’t fluctuate much from one track to the next—though latter tracks do err more tropical. But without sacrificing his identity or credibility, Party seems less reticent—or perhaps just better equipped—to make hits for himself. “LOYAL” and its remix are undeniable smashes. And “EYE ON IT”—about desiring a woman but not wanting to lose his current beau—sneaks up on you midway through the album, with its addictive, head bob-inducing steel drums.</p>
<p>But the track that follows “EYE ON IT” is the one that you’re going to be hearing a lot the next few months—whether we remain isolated or not. I’m talking about “BELIEVE IT,” a duet with Rihanna, in which each artist plays a lover asking the other to believe they’ll remain faithful. Rihanna has, of course, been musically MIA for long enough that it’s a delight merely to hear her again—doubly so, because she’s in top form. The song is moody enough to be a bedroom anthem, but its chorus is rich enough to get play at parties. But “BELIEVE IT” only works because Party holds his own alongside the pop heavyweight. Their voices bleed into each other so sumptuously that you find yourself rooting for them not to deceive each other—if for no other reason than so that there will be sequels. Here are two stars, and Drake is nowhere to be found.

<h3 id="the-new-partynextdoor-album-is-comingheres-what-you-need-to-know">The New PartyNextDoor Album Is Coming—Here&rsquo;s What You Need to Know</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.gq.com/photos/5e7a5386e84be60008709ba8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/PARTYMOBILE%2520Album%2520by%2520PARTYNEXTDOOR%2520gq%2520march%25202020.jpg" alt="img">
The Weeknd&rsquo;s After Hours aside, new music offerings have (understandably) been few and far between lately. But Friday, a worthy contender by PartyNextDoor is set to arrive: Partymobile, the latest album from the OVO signee, which has a real shot at successfully capturing this moment&rsquo;s frustrated, isolating, angsty vibes.</p>
<p>The hype behind this album is understandably huge, but for the uninitiated, we&rsquo;ve prepared a PartyNextDoor primer on what to expect from the R&amp;B singer&rsquo;s newest release.</p>
<p>Who is PartyNextDoor?</p>
<p>PartyNextDoor is one of the music industry&rsquo;s more prolific singer-songwriters, but he&rsquo;s reached this point relatively quietly. He was OVO&rsquo;s first-ever signee in 2013, and has earned his stripes while teaming up with Drake ever since. He has his own hits, like &ldquo;Come and See Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Recognize,&rdquo; &ldquo;Freak in You,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Break from Toronto.&rdquo; But there are also the songs he&rsquo;s played a hand in crafting: Rihanna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sex with Me,&rdquo; DJ Khaled&rsquo;s (and Rihanna&rsquo;s) &ldquo;Wild Thoughts,&rdquo; and a bunch of Drake tracks, like &ldquo;Elevate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ratchet Happy Birthday,&rdquo; and &ldquo;U with Me?&rdquo; The man can craft a tune.</p>
<p>What do I need to know about his new album?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been two-and-a-half years since a proper PartyNextDoor album. That album, Seven Days, was produced one major hit: &ldquo;Damage,&rdquo; which featured Halsey.</p>
<p>In PartyNextDoor&rsquo;s defense, he says he made Seven Days in, well, seven days. Partymobile has been in the works for a while (its release date has even been pushed back), which bodes well. If an album produced in seven days cultivated one banger, then PartyMobile should produce approximately a million bangers (don&rsquo;t check the math on that one).</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re social distancing (and you should be), you&rsquo;re stuck at home with nothing to do and very little to listen to. This is exactly the right moment for a dynamite PartyNextDoor album.</p>
<p>Do you have any tangible proof the new album will be good?</p>
<p>Beyond my unparalleled intuition and ability to predict the future? No. But we do have a single from Partymobile off which we can base our intuition. &ldquo;Split Decision,&rdquo; released in late February, seems like a fair barometer for what&rsquo;s to come—thumpy, brooding vocals about being a player, which feels like one of the few genres worth replaying right now. It&rsquo;s also likely &ldquo;Loyal&rdquo; (feat. Drake) will appear on the album, which is a certifiable dance hall heater—especially the remix with Bad Bunny.</p>
<p>Diehard PartyNextDoor fans were instructed to call a special number this week, which revealed additional snippets from the new album:</p>
<p>Anything else I should know?</p>
<p>Without lauding too much praise on celebrities right now, PartyNextDoor does deserve credit for donating 100% of his latest merch drop proceeds to the WHO and local Toronto charities.</p>
<p>Merch rollout with a new album has become an inescapable, sometimes annoying sideshow, so it&rsquo;s refreshing that this one is solely being used for good, rather than as a chart-boosting tactic.</p>
<p>Any notable guests I should know about?</p>
<p>The big rumor of late is that Rihanna might be featured on Partymobile. There is no definitive proof, though there is this kind of hard to hear soundbite from PartyNextDoor playing&hellip; Fortnite.</p>
<p>Rihanna News, thank you. It does make sense that she&rsquo;d show up on Partymobile, given that Party played a huge role in creating two of her most popular Anti songs. You&rsquo;ll just have to wait until Friday to find out for sure.
