As India enters shutdown mode to contain the spread of COVID-19, online medicine delivery firms such as 1MG, NetMeds and MedLife have temporarily suspended operations in many cities, after the police roughed up delivery workers, even after e-commerce were classified as an essential service.</p>
<p>Several delivery workers have also decided to stay back home after pressure from their families and due to fear of being manhandled by the authorities and police, industry executives and founders told Mint.</p>
<p>1MG, NetMeds and Medlife who occupy the top spot in medicine delivery in India said that they were also forced to cancel and delay orders that were already paid for. Delivery personnel in cities such as Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Gurugrum were also manhandled by cops even after they held valid curfew passes.</p>
<p>“Medlife delivery personnel Prakash in Delhi in the Todapur area was bringing back curfew passes and was hit by the cops on the way back to the fulfilment centre. In the process, he was injured and suffered bruises on his face and body. We now also have reports of similar incidents in Bangalore,&rdquo; said Ananth Narayanan, chief executive of MedLife in response to Mint’s emailed queries.</p>
<p>“These incidents do have a negative impact on the morale of the workforce, we have witnessed a cut of about 60% in deliveries in the last two days due to such operational hindrances, which also includes supply to our fulfilment centres. We haven’t suspended operations anywhere,&rdquo; added Narayanan</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, India announced a three-week nation-wide lockdown as the number of COVID-19 cases crossed the 500 mark.</p>
<p>The government declared e-commerce as an essential service category including grocery, food, and medicine delivery but several online delivery firms across food, medicine, and grocery has been struggling to meet the high demand because of restrictions following the lockdown.</p>
<p>MedLife, which offers medicine delivery and e-consultation, said that it witnessed a 300% spike in overall orders. Orders for categories such as hand sanitizers and masks surged by 50-times while a concentrated spike was also seen in immunity boosters and Paracetamol, said Narayanan in response to Mint’s queries.</p>
<p>“The country has seen an unprecedented upsurge of over 1400% in sanitation products, and over 500% in disinfectants in the last two weeks alone. This has put immense pressure on the manufacturers and we are working actively to source products from different producers so we can keep up with the demand&rdquo; said Pradeep Dadha, Founder and CEO of Netmeds.com in a statement.</p>
<p>Sequoia and Omidyar-backed 1MG said that it has completely suspended operations until authorities come up with more clarity on medicine delivery operations. “Key issue is getting (delivery) employees to fulfilment centres…but their families are not letting them go because they are afraid&hellip;We are working with authorities to get curfew passes and making transportation arrangements for employees to fulfilment centres… We expect to be back in operations from tomorrow,&rdquo; said Prashant Tandon, co-founder, 1MG.</p>
<p>Dadha, CEO of NetMeds said that the company has recommended online payments instead of cash on delivery to reduce the number of touch-points, and that it has also implemented an artificial intelligence-based solution to alert against bulk-buying of medicines by setting a maximum limit per order. After Prime Minister Modi’s speech on Tuesday night at 8, several city residents lined up outside Kirana stores, pharmacies, and fuel stations in India fearing that they would run short of supplies.</p>
<p>Bulk buying has also impacted the inventories of medicine and grocery delivery firms. “Our inventories are down by about 20-30%. We are working with each pharma distributor and trying to arrange vehicles to get the products to our fulfilment centres,&rdquo; said Narayanan of MedLife

<h3 id="medical-board-loosens-rules-for-online-medicine-and-physician-credentialing-because-of-coronavirus">Medical board loosens rules for online medicine and physician credentialing because of coronavirus</h3>

“Things are changing hour to hour in this pandemic,” said Dr. Candace Lapidus Sloane, a pediatric dermatologist and chair of the medical board. “We are facing something I’ve never seen before.”</p>
<p>The board voted 4-0 to approve the three measures in an emergency meeting held via conference call. The provisions are intended to boost the number of doctors available to treat patients for the coronavirus and other diseases, and to curb exposure of patients and health care workers to the virus.</p>
<p>In an urgent response to the coronavirus threat, the state medical board voted Monday to let doctors treat more patients online, made it easier for them to practice at multiple hospitals, and vowed to speed up the licensing of medical school graduates.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker had announced Sunday that medical insurers in Massachusetts must cover telehealth services, including phone- and video-based appointments.</p>
<p>The new rule approved by the board makes it explicit that a doctor can treat a patient whom he or she has never seen in person as long as the physician considers it best for the patient during the health crisis.</p>
<p>Sloane said the measure was prompted in part by four phone calls she received over the weekend from doctors quarantining themselves because they might have been exposed to the coronavirus. The doctors felt fine, she said, and wanted to treat patients online or on the phone.</p>
<p>Obviously, she said, some medical problems can’t be treated by a doctor using Skype or a phone.</p>
<p>“If you have a lump that needs to be examined, that can’t be done remotely,” she said in an interview after the vote.</p>
<p>The board also approved a measure that allows a physician credentialed to work at a particular hospital to practice medicine at any licensed hospital in the state without any additional credentialing.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Board members said this would help address a potential shortage if physicians are sickened by the coronavirus or need to be quarantined because of possible exposure.</p>
<p>Lisa O’Connor, a registered nurse who serves as the public member on the board, recommended passing the measure because the state was “only at the beginning of this epidemic.”</p>
<p>The board also passed a provision to speed up the licensing of medical school graduates in case health care facilities need more doctors right away.</p>
<p>Currently, it takes the board about 60 days to process an application for a license, assuming there are no problems, according to George Zachos, the agency’s executive director. Under the emergency provision, the board will seek to grant the license in a few days.</p>
<p>“This is the time for us to all pull together, and the medical community knows how to do that really well,” Sloane said.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts medical board regulates about 42,000 licensed physicians.</p>
