<p>Text Size: A- A+</p>
<p>New Delhi: Tensions between India and China continue to run high along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, where the two armies are currently in a stand-off.</p>
<p>However, this is hardly the first time India and China have faced off over their border dispute — there have been numerous stand-offs since 2014, when Narendra Modi led the NDA to power.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese transgressions across the disputed border has risen from 428 in 2015 to 663 in 2019, and a number of these transgressions eventually morphed into stand-offs between the two armies. The most prominent examples were near Chumar and Demchok in eastern Ladakh in 2014, at Burtse in northern Ladakh in 2015, and the 73-day stand-off at the Doklam plateau near the India-China-Bhutan tri-junction in 2017.</p>
<p>Smaller incidents of stare-downs between patrolling troops that morph into fist-fighting are rarely reported, but one in 2017 near Pangong Lake in Ladakh got a lot of media attention after a video showing the two sides hurling stones at each other went public. Another such incident took place on the banks of Pangong Lake in 2019.</p>
<p>All these stand-offs were eventually resolved by either diplomatic negotiations or through army delegation-level talks at the sites of dispute.</p>
<p>ThePrint looks at the three prominent military stand-offs between India and China during the Modi era, and how they were resolved.</p>
<p>Also read: India to seek ‘amicable solution’ with China amid military build-up on LAC</p>
<p>Chumar, 2014</p>
<p>A 16-day stand-off ensued between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh near the village of Chumar, after Indian soldiers tried to block Chinese construction work into what India considers its territory. This stand-off began on 16 September, the eve of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s first visit to India, about four months after Modi was elected PM.</p>
<p>The stand-off began after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) tried to extend the road from Chepzi towards Chumar (which India considers to be its own territory), and the construction work was stopped by Indian soldiers. Meanwhile, in Demchok, which is located in the Chumar area, PLA troops had pushed civilians into Indian territory to prevent ongoing work on an irrigation canal.</p>
<p>Soon enough, 1,500 Indian soldiers stood face-to-face with 750 PLA troops.</p>
<p>Following intense diplomatic and military negotiations, the issue was resolved. Troops from both sides agreed to withdraw after a high-level flag meeting led by major-generals.</p>
<p>The stand-off was resolved after India and China managed to reach a quid pro quo. While the Chinese agreed to not pursue construction of the Chepzi-Chumar road, India agreed to demolish its observation hut at Tible in the same sector, and refrain from building bunkers there.</p>

<p>Burtse, 2015</p>
<p>While much smaller in scale compared to the 2014 Chumar incident, another stand-off took place between Indian and Chinese forces at Burtse in the Depsang plains in northern Ladakh in 2015.</p>
<p>This stand-off ensued after the Indo Tibetan Border Police demolished a temporary hut — allegedly meant for surveillance — built by the PLA in Burtse. This was followed by the PLA calling for force reinforcements in the region, and the Indian side responding with tit-for-tat additional deployments.</p>
<p>The stand-off was resolved within a week by local army delegations at the ground level itself, and did not require any intervention by the governments. Following this, the Indian and Chinese armies decided to conduct a 12-day joint military exercise in China as a major confidence-building measure.</p>

<p>Doklam, 2017</p>
<p>The most prominent stand-off in recent years occurred in 2017 at Doklam, near the tri-junction point between India, China and Bhutan. The 73-day stand-off was the longest instance of the two militaries standing eyeball-to-eyeball in decades.</p>
<p>Doklam is spread over nearly 100 square kilometres, and comprises of a valley and a plateau. The area is surrounded by Bhutan’s Ha valley, Tibet’s (China) Chumbi valley, and the Indian state of Sikkim.</p>
<p>“The problem started in June when Chinese army engineers attempted to build a road through the Doklam plateau, claimed by both China and Bhutan. Following ‘coordination’ with Bhutanese authorities, Indian soldiers based just across the border intervened and literally stopped the Chinese crews in their tracks,” noted an article in War On The Rocks.</p>
<p>What followed was a 73-day stand-off, from 16 June to 28 August, and then weeks of intense diplomatic negotiations. While, initially, the Chinese foreign ministry demanded that India should unilaterally withdraw its troops, eventually both sides agreed and announced their withdrawal on 28 August, returning to their pre-16 June positions.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that China “blinked” as it agreed to stop its road construction in the region. But over the past couple of years, reports have suggested that China has been quietly building infrastructure and ramping up its military presence in the region, which has helped it gain an advantage in Doklam.</p>
<p>“Recent satellite images and intelligence reports show the Chinese have erected several permanent military posts, a few helipads and new trenches not very far from where the two armies faced off,” noted a 2018 report in The Hindu.</p>
<p>About 1,800 Chinese troops are stationed, even in deep winter, in the Doklam area, according to other reports.</p>

<p><img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/QlO7VV9mw7/sizes/untitled-design-19_md.png" alt="img">
So you&rsquo;re looking for the world&rsquo;s biggest machines eh? Then look no further. The following are a combination of scientific apparatus, construction, and mining vehicles, and some interesting novelties for your entertainment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll not mess around and just get stuck in. Enjoy.</p>
<p>The following are in no particular order and it is far from exhaustive.</p>
<p>RELATED: 7 MIGHTY MACHINES FOR MOVING TREES WITHOUT KILLING THEM</p>
<ol>
<li>The Large Hadron Collider is enormous</li>
</ol>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider is the biggest machine man has ever built to date. It was built to study the tiniest of things, subatomic particles.</p>
<p>This particle accelerator is 27 kilometers in circumference and is buried 175 meters under the ground near Geneva. Switzerland. There are plans for a newer upgraded one that will be four times bigger.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Giant Bucket Wheel Excavator tears the ground to shreds</li>
</ol>
<p>The world&rsquo;s second-largest machine is the mighty Giant Bucket Wheel Excavator, Bagger 293. This is a titan amongst giants. It was built in Germany in 1995.</p>
<p>The whole thing stands at 96 meters tall and is 225 meters long. It also weighs in at an astonishing 14,061 tonnes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Big Bertha makes boring child&rsquo;s play</li>
</ol>
<p>Bertha is the world&rsquo;s biggest tunnel boring machine. She dwarfs any of her competitors with a total length of 300 feet and five stories high.</p>
<p>She is a massive 7,000-ton machine that needs to be shipped between work sites. Her 17.5-meter diameter could easily swallow the world&rsquo;s second-largest borer.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>&ldquo;The Prelude&rdquo;: officially the world&rsquo;s biggest ship</li>
</ol>
<p>The arrival of &ldquo;The Prelude&rdquo; has forced &ldquo;Emma Maersk&rdquo; into second place for the biggest ship. She took to the water for the first time in South Korea. &ldquo;The Prelude&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t technically a ship per se, but rather a floating natural gas facility.</p>
<p>She is 487 meters long and &ldquo;The Prelude&rdquo; would be 45 meters taller than the Empire State Building if laid side by side. When fully laden she weighs in at 600,000 tons.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>This might just be the world&rsquo;s biggest motorbike</li>
</ol>
<p>Built by Fabio Reggiani, this mega bike stands at 5 meters tall and weighs 5.5 tons. This is the biggest two-wheeled vehicle to ever travel at 91 meters.</p>
<p>It even features some very extended handles and a 5,000 cc 5.7 liter V8 Chevrolet engine with a 3-speed transmission. Nice.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The World&rsquo;s biggest remote-controlled robot is a dragon, apparently</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh hell yeah, now we&rsquo;re talking. Germany’s Zollner Elektronik AG spent six years with a 15-man team to design the biggest remote controller robot ever.</p>
<p>The dragon was designed to replace the mechanical star of Germany’s favorite play, “Drachenstich”. It stands at 4.5 meters, weighs 11 tons and actually breathes fire.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Meet the world&rsquo;s largest aircraft, The Stratolaunch</li>
</ol>
<p>The Stratolaunch was revealed by Microsoft&rsquo;s co-founder Paul Allen before his untimely death in 2018. This monster has a wingspan of 117 meters and weighs in at 580 tons.</p>
<p>She needs a total of six engines to get off the ground. She has been designed to launch rockets into space from the air, hence the name. What a beauty.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Dump in style with The Belaz 75710</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh yes. This entry on our list of biggest machines is a real monster. Powered by a hybrid-diesel engine, The Belaz 75710 was built for one task only - moving a lot of earth and rubble.</p>
<p>Its two sixteen-cylinder engines provide the beast with 13,738 pounds of torque. That&rsquo;s more than the combined power of seventeen heavy-duty pickup trucks. Wow.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>The Overburden Conveyor Bridge F60 does not mess around</li>
</ol>
<p>This monster is the world&rsquo;s biggest conveyor bridge. Her entire structure is something to behold measuring in at 502 meters long, 202 meters wide and 80 meters in height. It weighs in at about 11,000 tons.</p>
<p>This beast was built in East Germany in 1991 by VEB TAKRAF Lauchhammer.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>FAST is the world&rsquo;s biggest telescope</li>
</ol>
<p>FAST or Five Hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope is a radio telescope that can be found in China. She is a radio telescope located in the Dawodang depression in Pingtung County in SW China.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>This might just be the world&rsquo;s largest floating vacuum cleaner</li>
</ol>
<p>The Queen of the Netherlands is a hopper dredging ship that was built in 1998. She has a gross tonnage of 33,423 tonnes and a deadweight of almost 60,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>She measures in at 230.71 meters long by 32 meters wide. You can even track where she is in the world here.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>&ldquo;La Princesse&rdquo; is an arachnophobe&rsquo;s worst nightmare</li>
</ol>
<p>La Princesse is a giant mechanical spider that weighs in at 37 tonnes. She stands in at 15 meters and moves using 50 axes of hydraulic movement. This monster takes twelve people to operate her.</p>
<p>To move from place to place she needs 16 cranes, 8 cherry pickers, and a 250-man crew.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>The Komatsu D575A Superdozer certainly is super</li>
</ol>
<p>The Komatsu D575A-3SD super dozer is the world’s biggest and most powerful production bulldozer. She is manufactured by Komatsu in Ishikawa, Japan. This monster is mostly active in North America and Australia.</p>
<p>She is 5 meters tall, 14.5 meters long and 7 meters wide.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>The Le Tourneau L-2350 moves earth like it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business</li>
</ol>
<p>The P&amp;H LeTourneau L-2350 Loader is the current world record holder for the biggest earth mover. It has a massive lifting payload of 72 tons.</p>
<p>This massive machine has a standard bucket of 40.52 cubic meters and a 2300 horsepower engine.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>This is one of the world&rsquo;s most massive mining excavators</li>
</ol>
<p>The Liebherr 9800 Mining Excavator is one of the world&rsquo;s largest bucket excavators. They typically weigh in at 810 tonnes and have a bucket capacity of 47 cubic meters.</p>
<p>What a beast.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>The NASA crawler-transporter was built to move entire rockets</li>
</ol>
<p>Although around 50 years old, this entry on our list of the biggest machines is still impressive. These enormous 40 meters long, 35 meters wide machines weigh in at around 2720 tonnes.</p>
<p>They were used to carry NASA rockets from site to site at a breathtaking 1 mph. One of the two existing crawlers has actually clocked up a total of 2,207 miles.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>The Taisun Cranes are true monster machines</li>
</ol>
<p>Another gargantuan entry on our list of biggest machines is a monster. When building big machines you&rsquo;ll inevitably need something equally big to help you move bits of it around. The Taisun Cranes at the Yantai Raffles Shipyard in China might just be fit for purpose.</p>
<p>This is widely regarded as the most powerful crane in the world. It boasts a payload of over 20,000 tonnes.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>The Antonov An-225 &ldquo;Mriya&rdquo; rules the skies</li>
</ol>
<p>The Antonov An-225 &ldquo;Mriya&rdquo; is yet another of the world&rsquo;s biggest planes. Powered by 6 enormous turbofan engines, this plane is officially the biggest operational cargo plane.</p>
<p>She has a wingspan of 88.4 meters and is 84 meters in length. It weighs around 285,000 kg when empty and was first debuted in 1988. Each of her Ivchenko Progress D-18T turbofan engines, each capable of pumping out over 23 thousand kg of thrust &ndash; quite impressive.</p>
<p>These were selected for their high takeoff thrust, low specific fuel consumption, and impressive reliability. The Antonov-255 requires no less than 32 wheels to carry her weight on the ground and can, amazingly, turn within a 60-meter-wide runway.</p>
<p>It was developed by the Soviets as a super heavy transporter to replace their aging Myasishchev VM-T. It was codenamed &ldquo;Cossack&rdquo; by NATO forces during the cold war.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, the &ldquo;Mriya&rdquo; was purchased by the Ukrainian company Antonov Airlines who has used it as a transporter ever since.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>The Bagger 288: the Bagger 293&rsquo;s not so little brother</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bagger 288 is another absolutely enormous machine. It was built by the German company Krupp and is largely used by the energy and mining firm Rheinbraun.</p>
<p>The Bagger 288 is a bucket-wheel excavator primarily designed for use as a mobile strip mining machine. Construction of the machine began in 1978 and she superseded the Big Muskie as the heaviest lad vehicle on the planet at 13,500 tons.</p>
<p>Design and construction took around 10 years and cost somewhere in the region of $100 million. Bagger 288 is 225 meters long, 46 meters wide, and 96 meters tall.</p>
<p>She is propelled by 12 enormous caterpillar tracks and can travel up to 10 meters per minute. Bagger 288 was herself superseded by the larger and heavier Bagger 293 and NASA Crawler-Transporter.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>The Seawise Giant lived up to its name</li>
</ol>
<p>The &ldquo;Seawise Giant&rdquo; is also one of the world&rsquo;s biggest existing machines. Also known as the &ldquo;Happy giant&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jahre Viking&rdquo;, &ldquo;Knock Nevis&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oppama&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mont&rdquo;, this was once the world&rsquo;s longest ship ever conceived and built.</p>
<p>She was originally built by Sumitomo Heavy Industries in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan, and once possessed the greatest deadweight tonnage ever recorded. Fully loaded, the ship would displace somewhere in the order of 657,000 tonnes and she was so large that she was not able to navigate certain waterways like the English Channel, the Suez Canal, and the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>The ship was badly damaged during the Iran-Iraq war but was later salvaged and restored back into active service. &ldquo;Seawise Giant&rdquo; was later converted to floating storage and offloading unit (FSO) in 2004. After being sold to Indian shipbreakers in 2009, she was renamed &ldquo;Mont&rdquo; for her final journey where she was beached ready for scrapping.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>The Schwerer Gustav was one of the biggest guns ever conceived</li>
</ol>
<p>And finally, the Schwerer Gustav was also one of the world&rsquo;s biggest machines of all time. It was so big that is needed to be mounted on a railcar and was developed by the Third Reich during the Second World War.</p>
<p>It was first conceived just prior to the war and was ordered as part of the buildup towards the invasion of France. The idea was to use the enormous cannon to help break the back of the formidable Maginot Line that the French had built to prevent German invasions after WW1.</p>
<p>Each of the Schwerer Gustav&rsquo;s shells was 800 mm in diameter. The gun itself weighed somewhere in the order of 1,350 tonnes and each shell weighed 4.8 tonnes.</p>
<p>The gun was so powerful that it could fire each of its enormous projectiles over 47 km with a muzzle velocity of something like 820 meters per second.</p>
<p>After significant investment in time and resources, this formidable artillery piece would have very little impact on the outcome of the war. It was destroyed just prior to the end of the war to prevent capture by Allied forces.</p>
<p>So there you go, some of the Biggest Machines in the world, as requested. There are some real monsters in this list, we think you&rsquo;ll agree.</p>
<p>From the construction industry to mining to strange street entertainment, we&rsquo;ve covered them all, more or less. Have we missed any out? We&rsquo;d be very happy to hear your suggestions.

Virgin Atlantic is set to return to the skies this summer, announcing new destinations for August and beyond.</p>
<p>Virgin has today announced plans to return to the following destinations:</p>
<p>Heathrow to Barbados (August 1)</p>
<p>Heathrow to San Francisco (August 4)</p>
<p>Heathrow to Tel Aviv (August 9)</p>
<p>Heathrow to Miami (August 18)</p>
<p>Heathrow to Lagos (August 23)</p>
<p>Heathrow to Atlanta (August 25)</p>
<p>In September the airline will resume services from Heathrow to Washington, D.C, Seattle, Las Vegas, Mumbai, Delhi and Johannesburg, with flights operating from Heathrow to Boston in October.</p>
<p>Last month, the airline opened bookings for the summer of 2021, announcing 24 destinations. It said in a statement: “As countries start to lift travel restrictions and demand for travel begins to return, it is expected that Virgin Atlantic will steadily increase passengers flying in the second half of the year, with a further, gradual recovery through 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been a difficult time for the long-haul airline. In early May, Virgin Atlantic announced it would pull out of Gatwick Airport and cut 3,150 jobs, roughly a third of its workforce, in an attempt to cut costs. The company has been particularly exposed to the virus as long-haul flights have been the worst affected in the sector, and are likely to take the longest to recover.

A 14.73-km long aqueduct (an elevated canal with a road on top) of Tidagundi Branch Canal, the longest and the tallest structure in the country, is thrown open to public on Friday.</p>
<p>The Tidagundi viaduct, a part of Mulawadi Lift Irrigation under Upper Krishna Phase III project, was constructed at a cost of Rs 280.26 crore.</p>
<p>The elevated canal with road atop stands on over 400 giant pillars at the height of 30 metres from Bhuranpur godown to Bhuthnal. The aqueduct will irrigate 63,190 acres of land in its catchment in 29 villages of Vijayapura and Indi taluks. The canal is expected to fill 25 lakes and ponds in the region.</p>
<p>The project was completed in just two years using precast concrete structures with pre-tensioned tendons. Also, it did not face the land acquisition hassles as the land required for the project was</p>
<p>minimal.</p>
<p>Babaleshwar MLA M B Patil, Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Nagthan MLA Devanand Chauhan inaugurated the viaduct by offering Baagina to the canal at its source at Buranpur.</p>
<p>Basanagouda Patil Yatnal addressing the gathering at the inaugural function, said, “Tidagundi viaduct is a model for the country. This elevated canal has taken Krishna to the border of the state. The credit for this engineering marvel should go to M B Patil.”

<h3 id="incomplete-canal-system-defeats-purpose-of-handri-neeva-sujala-sravanthi-in-andhra-pradesh">&ldquo;Incomplete canal system defeats purpose of Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi in Andhra Pradesh&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/1/19/w600X390/kurnool2.jpg" alt="img">
S Guru Srikanth By</p>
<p>Express News Service</p>
<p>VIJAYAWADA: Though reservoirs under Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) in Anantapur, Kurnool, Kadapa and Chittoor were completed in two phases, the incomplete distributary canal system defeats the very purpose of the project. Farmers&rsquo; organisations of Rayalaseema are now demanding that the government focus on the early completion of the distributary canals.</p>
<p>Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, during his recent tour of Rayalaseema region and review meetings with the irrigation department, underscored the need of enhancing the canal carrying capacity of various projects, including HNSS. Following his directions, HNSS authorities went back to the drawing board and prepared a new DPR, which is now awaiting the government approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the new proposals have been submitted to enhance the carrying capacity of HNSS main canal from 3,200 cusecs to 6,000 cusecs, the survey and levelling needed for determining the command area and various field-level distributary system will take more time. As of now, survey and levelling work is yet to commence,&rdquo; a higher official of HNSS said.</p>
<p>It means that to reach the full potential of the project and achieve the target of 6.025 lakh acres of new ayacut in Rayalaseema, it may take more than 5-6 years, if not more. &ldquo;Even after completing the reservoirs and majority of main canal, not even one-tenth of the targeted Ayacut was achieved,&rdquo; an irrigation department official pointed out.</p>
<p>HNSS is the longest multipurpose water canal in the Rayalaseema region with a total length of 565 km. Though the idea of the project was conceived by Sir Arthur Cotton, who was behind every major irrigation project in Andhra Pradesh, the final shape was given to it when NT Rama Rao was Chief Minister in the early &rsquo;80s.</p>
<p>As there was no assured water, the project was planned on the surplus waters of Krishna river, which were to be taken during 120 flood days in the Krishna river (from August to November). The project was designed to utilise 40 TMC of floodwater to be drawn from backwaters of Srisailam project to provide irrigation water for 6.025 lakh acres in Kurnool, Anantapur, Kadapa and Chittoor districts and at the same time supply drinking water to about 33 lakh people in the region. But the actual works of the project could only commence after 2004 when YS Rajasekhara Reddy was Chief Minister.</p>
<p>The total project cost was Rs 6,850 crore (phase 1 - Rs 2,774 crore and phase 2, Rs 4,076 crore). The YSR government gave administrative approval for phase 1 on July 24, 2004, for Rs 1,305 crore for the first phase of works and again a revised administrative approval for phase- 1 was given on January 3, 2007, for Rs 2,774 crore. For Phase- II works, administrative approval was given on October 15, 2005, for Rs 1,880 crore and revised administrative approval was given on January 3, 2007, for Rs 4,076 crore.</p>
<p>HNSS has as many as 13 projects for lifting the water at nine different stages and a total of eight reservoirs &ndash; three in the first phase and five in the second phase. Construction of reservoirs - Krishnagiri, Pathikonda, Jeedipalli, Gollapalli, Cherolopalli, Marala, Srinivasapuram, and Adivipalli &ndash; was completed, but the distributary network remains incomplete.</p>
<p>Those in the know of things say that corruption is the main reason for snail-pace of works and even those completed were reported to be full of faults. For example, the canal carrying capacity of the unlined main canal was supposed to be 3,200 cusecs, but currently, only around 2,000 cusecs discharge rate is possible. The reason: there is no definite answer and discussions in different fora, including Assembly, result in the blame game.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, it is people of Rayalaseema, who have to pay the price, as the expected new ayacut is not realised even after spending thousands of crores of taxpayers’ money. We hope that the present government, takes the issue seriously,” D Jagadeesh, CPI leader, said.

<h3 id="kerala-flood-mitigation-chengannur-canal-case-study">&ldquo;Kerala flood mitigation: Chengannur canal case study&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2020-03-06/0.12571200_1583490267_2.jpg" alt="img">
Ensuring flow in state’s blocked-out waterways can help prevent floods; public participation is important</p>
<p>Chengannur municipality and the nearby village panchayats of Pandanad, Budhanoor, Puliyoor in Kerala’s Alappuzha district were severely affected by the massive 2018 Kerala floods, causing extensive devastation to people’s lives, livelihood, habitation, land, livestock, water and sanitation systems.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the 2018 floods in these areas was the blockage in flow of water from the Pamba river through the thodukal (canals) in the area. These canals have been nature’s own drainage system for draining rain water from the land into the rivers and in between rivers.</p>
<p>In several meetings with people’s representatives in the three-tier panchayat system, the legislator of Chengannur and the people of Pandanad, everyone pointed out that the rejuvenation of these canals, once used for transport and irrigation, was the only way to prevent or at least mitigate the impact of major floods.</p>
<p>People at Kodiyattukara near Moozhikkal, where the Illimala canal originates, said that even kettuvallangal (cargo boats) carrying farm produce from the area used to navigate through the canal into the Pamba river, all the way to Alappuzha town to sell.</p>
<p>Siltation of canals and drains, particularly post-flood, and disposal of solid waste into rivers affecting their carrying capacity, thereby increasing the likelihood of floods, has been highlighted by the state government’s policy document on the Rebuild Kerala Initiative.</p>
<p>Several schemes announced in Kerala&rsquo;s 2019-20 Budget such as the new Kuttanad package, which includes desilting and cleaning of backwaters and rivers in the region and the scheme for rejuvenating 24 rivers on the lines of the Varattar address the above concerns.</p>
<p>Varattar was a dead river flowing through the area. Once revived, it could absorb a good amount of water from the Pamba during the 2018 floods, partly limiting its impact.</p>
<p>One of the longest canals in Chengannur and its neighbouring areas is the Illimala - Moozhikkal thodu, otherwise known as Illimala canal, which stretches up to 12 kilometres.</p>
<p>In meetings with Chengannur legislator Saji Cherian and the officials of the minor irrigation department, we came to know that the state government has allotted funds to initiate the rejuvenation of the Illimala canal.</p>
<p>Factors blocking flow of water</p>
<p>The people of Pandanad, through which the Illimala canal passes, were of the firm view that the encroachment and reclamation of various canals and rivulets for habitational and commercial purposes and for construction of roads and pathways did affect the natural flow of water from the rivers during the floods.</p>

<p>They also mentioned that sand mining, that used to be rampant in the Pamba, also affected the natural flow of water. They pointed out that trees like Attuvanchi and bamboo, which used to be plenty on the riverbanks and could hold the land and withstand floods are not used that much nowadays.</p>
<p>These are being replaced by stonewalls, which are not as effective in holding land. They also expressed concern that in the summer that followed the floods, many wells in Pandanad had dried up. Water in the few wells that had water was not drinkable and was causing various infections including urinary infection among women.</p>
<p>A report on sand auditing in the Pamba, commissioned by the state government (C-Graf 2014) points out: “Almost all canals (brooks) converging on to the Pamba carry with them, huge quantities of household waste”.</p>
<p>It says: “In low-lying areas of the river (Pamba) as well as where the flow is very less, one can see huge amounts of waste piling up” and that this is “predominant in areas near Parumala and the boundary areas of Pandanad and Thiruvanvandoor”, in and close to the flow route of Illimala canal.</p>
<p>This report highlights that large-scale land encroachment in all canals for increasing landholdings or expanding pathways, have resulted in the reduction of their width. It also mentions about the absence of retention walls in some areas.</p>
<p>Another government-supported study report, on Integrated Watershed Management Programme for Chengannur Block (GITPAC), notices the broken state of canals and bunds in Chengannur block and silt deposition affecting the natural flow of water.</p>
<p>The report suggested side protection of canals, cleaning and deepening them as well as desilting.</p>
<p>The rejuvenation of Illimala canal is likely to start now, as the Northeast monsoon has ended and the summer has set in early, keeping the rains distant till the onset of the Southwest monsoon by early June.</p>
<p>Route of Illimala</p>
<p>The canal originates from Moozhikkal in Chengannur municipality, flows to Puliyoor panchayat, then to Budhanoor panchayat and then on to Illimala, with Budhanoor on one side and Pandanad panchayat on the other side and joins a tributary of the Pamba. Flowing further from there for about 100 metres, it finally reaches the Achancovil river.</p>
<p>The natural flow of water in the canal is from the Pamba to the Achancovil, but the flow is influenced by the water level in the two rivers at different times of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to channelising the flow of water between the two rivers, rejuvenating the thodu is also expected to improve the quality of drinking water by raising the water table across a vast area on both sides of its 12-km route and facilitating natural filtration of water.</p>
<p>Rejuvenation will also support paddy cultivation in many padashekharams (a collection of paddy fields with a common outer bund) in the area, which is not possible right now as the choked canal is unusable for draining out water from Punja fields or irrigation. Punja paddy fields follow the Holland model of cultivation, where water is drained out of the fields before beginning a season’s cultivation and is let in from the rivers after cultivation</p>

<p>The way forward</p>
<p>Canal rejuvenation requires technical experts such as engineers as well as contractors to manage techno-managerial tasks, involving desilting, construction of walls / bunds using machinery and large amounts of labour.</p>
<p>But the exercise needs to be planned, managed and monitored by and with people. This can be done by involving farmers’ organisations, residents’ associations, co-operative societies, Kudumbasree, MGNREGA workers organisations, students of colleges in the area and similar groups in discussions about rejuvenation.</p>
<p>A wide network of support is necessary not only for making the exercise people-centric, but also for its sustenance, as it can ensure preserving the work done through necessary behavioural changes in the society to which they belong.</p>
<p>Along with the rejuvenation activity, household composting of bio-degradable waste should be promoted in the houses in panchayats and the municipality through which the canal flows. Non bio-degradable waste should be collected and disposed of safely by the panchayats and the municipality.</p>
<p>Awareness programmes should be launched to prevent waste deposits in the canal, to promote household composting and to prevent encroachments and sand mining. Door-to-door campaigns by college students, outdoor publicity, promoting media campaigns by media-persons are some of the means that could be adopted.</p>
<p>Future encroachment of the canal or its banks should be strictly prevented by law-enforcement agencies. Existing encroachments should be dealt with in a phased manner in the later phases of rejuvenation and sensitive to the poor who may have resorted to it for their dwellings.</p>
<p>As suggested by the people of Pandanad, planting bamboo and Attuvanchi on the banks of the canal would help in preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Undertaking a walk along the banks of the canal with the participation of various organisations and groups of people mentioned above will help in identifying the type of rejuvenation work required at various points of the canal such as desilting, de-weeding, waste clearance etc.</p>
