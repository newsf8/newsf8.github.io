<p>(CNN) On Wednesday, the morning of the UK&rsquo;s second day under lockdown after a stay-at-home order issued by Boris Johnson, the news broke that Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s eldest son and heir to the British throne, has tested positive for coronavirus. He&rsquo;s currently self-isolating with mild symptoms in Balmoral, Scotland. His wife Camilla, who tested negative for the virus, is self-isolating in a separate part of the estate. His 93-year-old mother the Queen is isolating at Windsor Castle, alongside her husband Prince Philip, who is 98. Many will be able to relate to the experience of separation from their loved ones during the current outbreak. At least, the royals have provided a conspicuous example of how seriously everyone should treat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As is always the case with breaking news about the royals, it spread like wildfire, immediately prompting questions like &ldquo;how many servants serve his breakfast?&rdquo; &ldquo;why did he get a test when my grandma didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and, of course, &ldquo;when did he last see his mum?&rdquo; (March 12, by the way, and a royal source told CNN that Charles had been advised he was contagious from March 13.)</p>
<p>It is unlikely that much of the population will remain unaware of the Prince&rsquo;s status for long. And in a country which &ndash; like the US &ndash; has seen some of its older and more at-risk inhabitants hesitate to treat the coronavirus as a serious threat to their own health, this might prove to be a much-needed injection of public awareness about the urgent risks involved in not heeding the orders to stay home.</p>
<p>There have been troubling reports from both sides of the pond about people failing to comply with government guidelines to stay isolated to stem the tide of the coronavirus. Many of those reports have focused thus far on spring breakers and St Patrick&rsquo;s Day partiers &ndash; but there have also been conspicuous instances of older people who appear reluctant to take public health messaging to heart.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a 75-year-old caller to BBC Radio Solent said that people in her age bracket didn&rsquo;t care whether they caught the virus, as they&rsquo;d &ldquo;had their lives,&rdquo; and that if people are &ldquo;going to get it,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re &ldquo;going to get it anyway.&rdquo; Last week, Woman&rsquo;s Hour, a popular BBC Radio show with a broad listenership, featured a caller in her 80s who &ndash; in the presenter&rsquo;s words &ndash; was &ldquo;incandescent&rdquo; with rage at what she felt had been patronizing government advice intended to see her left alone in her house &ldquo;to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have many friends who report their own frustrations with older parents who remain unconvinced that they should give up socializing, keeping regular appointments, or visiting family &ndash; despite the clear evidence that such behavior contributes directly to the coronavirus&rsquo; spread, and puts them at huge personal risk. It&rsquo;s clearly a common problem &ndash; and much advice in the lifestyle sections of various news sites has been aimed at millennials attempting to convince their elderly relatives that continuing as normal is dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable why this has been a hard pill to swallow for some. The beloved &ldquo;Keep Calm and Carry On&rdquo;-style rhetoric of World War II is emblematic of a feeling among many that wavering in the face of any threat is a sign of weakness or giving up. Rhetoric suggesting that younger people are overreacting to the coronavirus &ndash; or that the elderly will easily weather it &ndash; features regular references to the war, and the no-fuss personalities it apparently forged</p>
<p>The 84-year-old writer of a piece titled &ldquo;I survived rationing, I&rsquo;m not scared of the coronavirus,&rdquo; published in the The Sunday Times last week, mentioned that he&rsquo;d spoken to others his age who were also sick of &ldquo;ageist propaganda,&rdquo; and scoffed at thirty-something &ldquo;scaredy-cats.&rdquo; Misapplied references to &ldquo;Blitz spirit&rdquo; often create a sense of continuing on without allowing normal life to be impeded, rather than acknowledging that the history in question involved a huge sacrifice of personal freedoms.</p>
<p>The sense that a lockdown marks the banishment of hard-won liberties &ndash; as opposed to a necessary public safety intervention &ndash; has even been reflected by royals&rsquo; favorite newspaper. On Tuesday, the first day of the UK lockdown, The Telegraph, whose average reader as of 2018 was 61-years-old according to its own data &ndash; the oldest audience for a British news brand, according to marketing site The Drum &ndash; led with the front page splash: &ldquo;The End Of Freedom.&rdquo; On the same day, the paper ran a column titled &ldquo;The self-pitying &lsquo;woke&rsquo; generation needed a war. In the coronavirus, they&rsquo;ve got one.&rdquo; The heavy implication is that anyone who has lived through greater privations than millennials need not bother themselves with new disasters, for they already have the necessary coping mechanisms to weather them.</p>
<p>Considering that so much media messaging has been confused, it is no wonder that many feel they don&rsquo;t need to make concessions to the coronavirus &ndash; either because they have already paid their dues, or because it is simply an overblown fuss. But the seriousness with which Clarence House has dealt with Prince Charles&rsquo; diagnosis &ndash; despite his apparently mild symptoms &ndash; sends a clear message to that isolation isn&rsquo;t just for one&rsquo;s own sake. It could prompt a rethink among those who have so far assumed that the advice to self-isolate doesn&rsquo;t apply to them.</p>

<p>For many, it probably seems antithetical that the heroic thing to do in this moment is totally at odds with ideas of heroism many have had their whole lives. But as Prince Charles has demonstrated, the best thing to do right now is to keep calm, and stay inside.

<h3 id="prince-charles-coronavirus-diagnosis-has-royal-watchers-concerned-for-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle">Prince Charles’ Coronavirus Diagnosis Has Royal Watchers Concerned for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Prince-Charles-Harry-Meghan-618x500.jpg" alt="img">
Royal watchers are worried about the possibility that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have contracted the coronavirus following Prince Charles’ positive test results. The royals just confirmed that Charles, 71, has contracted COVID-19 and is now in self-quarantine. Given how Charles recently appeared in public with Harry and Meghan, fans are wondering if they are at risk as well.</p>

<p>Prince Charles tests positive for coronavirus</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace recently confirmed that Charles has tested positive for COVID-19. The royals do not know how Charles contracted the virus, mainly because of the number of people he has come into contact with over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>While Charles is in the early stages of the virus, the palace assured royal watchers that he is in self-isolation and is doing well. The Prince of Wales is currently at Birkhall, where he is expected to remain for several weeks.</p>
<p>Prince Charles did not jump the queue for a coronavirus test, UK says https://t.co/Xl475qICf8 pic.twitter.com/dmrnjvPee4 — Reuters (@Reuters) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>Exactly when a person becomes contagious remains uncertain, but doctors believe that Prince Charles could have been passing the virus along as early as March 13. According to Express, this is one day after Charles visited Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>“Doctors’ most conservative estimate is that the Prince is likely to have been contagious from around March 13 – the day after he carried out his last official public engagement,” royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills shared.</p>
<p>This timeline has raised concerns over other members of the royal family who may have come in contact with Charles. His wife, Camilla Parker Bowles, has tested negative for the coronavirus and is distancing herself from him.</p>
<p>When was Prince Charles’ last public engagement?</p>
<p>The last time Charles took part in a public engagement was on March 12. The Prince of Wales was present for a dinner at Mansion House in support of a bushfire relief charity.</p>
<p>At some point prior to the dinner, Charles and Queen Elizabeth held a private meeting at Buckingham Palace. It is unclear what the two discussed, but that puts Charles and Her Majesty in the same room a day before doctors believe he was contagious.</p>
<p>The doctors are not 100 percent positive when Prince Charles may have been contagious, and we still do not know if he and Queen Elizabeth made any physical contact. Charles has been avoiding handshakes in recent weeks, so it is likely that they observed social distancing measures.</p>
<p>Charles has reportedly been in contact with his two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, who have been very supportive. Harry, of course, is currently in Canada with his wife, Meghan Markle, and son, Archie Harrison.</p>
<p>Fans worry about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s health</p>
<p>Following the announcement, fans raised concerns about Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s, health. The couple wrapped up their final round of public engagements on March 9, when they appeared alongside Prince Charles at the Commonwealth Day service.</p>
<p>“Did Harry know and Meghan know? If Charles got this thing that’s like all the Royals got to be in danger now surely #CoronavirusLockdown,” one fan wrote, while another added, “He better stay the F away from her majesty the queen and Prince Harry and the amazing Meghan Markle.”</p>
<p>Meghan lays down the law and forbids Harry from going back to UK to see coronavirus-infected Prince Charles https://t.co/6pMVZTPcqM — Daily Mail U.K. (@DailyMailUK) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>Meghan immediately returned to Canada after the event. Harry reunited with his family a few days later. The Sussexes have been in Canada ever since and are now self-isolating as a precaution against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Considering how doctors believe that Prince Charles was not contagious until March 13, Harry and Meghan had a very low risk of contracting the coronavirus from him.</p>
<p>Even still, there is always the possibility that they got the virus from somebody else, as we still do not know how Charles contracted it in the first place. Hopefully, Harry and Meghan are safe and are in good health.</p>
<p>Has Queen Elizabeth been tested?</p>
<p>With Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth being in the same room a day before he was contagious, royal experts believe that Her Majesty should get tested just in case.</p>
<p>According to Express, royal expert Sarah Campbell raised the question about Queen Elizabeth being tested, especially considering how she is in her 90s. If Her Majesty contracted the disease, there is a high chance that she would suffer serious side effects.</p>
<p>“This does beg the question has the Queen been tested,” Campbell stated. “The statement on Prince Charles has just been released and we are expecting to get some more details about this.”</p>
<p>The royal family has taken precautions against getting the coronavirus. Last week, the royals canceled several events and are expected to make more cancelations unless the pandemic takes a major turn for the good.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth has also left Buckingham Palace as is currently staying at Windsor Castle with Prince Philip. The two are no longer accepting audiences and are expected to remain out of the public eye for several weeks.</p>
<p>Prince Charles is in self-quarantine in Scotland.
