<p>(CNN) On Wednesday, the morning of the UK&rsquo;s second day under lockdown after a stay-at-home order issued by Boris Johnson, the news broke that Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s eldest son and heir to the British throne, has tested positive for coronavirus. He&rsquo;s currently self-isolating with mild symptoms in Balmoral, Scotland. His wife Camilla, who tested negative for the virus, is self-isolating in a separate part of the estate. His 93-year-old mother the Queen is isolating at Windsor Castle, alongside her husband Prince Philip, who is 98. Many will be able to relate to the experience of separation from their loved ones during the current outbreak. At least, the royals have provided a conspicuous example of how seriously everyone should treat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As is always the case with breaking news about the royals, it spread like wildfire, immediately prompting questions like &ldquo;how many servants serve his breakfast?&rdquo; &ldquo;why did he get a test when my grandma didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and, of course, &ldquo;when did he last see his mum?&rdquo; (March 12, by the way, and a royal source told CNN that Charles had been advised he was contagious from March 13.)</p>
<p>It is unlikely that much of the population will remain unaware of the Prince&rsquo;s status for long. And in a country which &ndash; like the US &ndash; has seen some of its older and more at-risk inhabitants hesitate to treat the coronavirus as a serious threat to their own health, this might prove to be a much-needed injection of public awareness about the urgent risks involved in not heeding the orders to stay home.</p>
<p>There have been troubling reports from both sides of the pond about people failing to comply with government guidelines to stay isolated to stem the tide of the coronavirus. Many of those reports have focused thus far on spring breakers and St Patrick&rsquo;s Day partiers &ndash; but there have also been conspicuous instances of older people who appear reluctant to take public health messaging to heart.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a 75-year-old caller to BBC Radio Solent said that people in her age bracket didn&rsquo;t care whether they caught the virus, as they&rsquo;d &ldquo;had their lives,&rdquo; and that if people are &ldquo;going to get it,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re &ldquo;going to get it anyway.&rdquo; Last week, Woman&rsquo;s Hour, a popular BBC Radio show with a broad listenership, featured a caller in her 80s who &ndash; in the presenter&rsquo;s words &ndash; was &ldquo;incandescent&rdquo; with rage at what she felt had been patronizing government advice intended to see her left alone in her house &ldquo;to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have many friends who report their own frustrations with older parents who remain unconvinced that they should give up socializing, keeping regular appointments, or visiting family &ndash; despite the clear evidence that such behavior contributes directly to the coronavirus&rsquo; spread, and puts them at huge personal risk. It&rsquo;s clearly a common problem &ndash; and much advice in the lifestyle sections of various news sites has been aimed at millennials attempting to convince their elderly relatives that continuing as normal is dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable why this has been a hard pill to swallow for some. The beloved &ldquo;Keep Calm and Carry On&rdquo;-style rhetoric of World War II is emblematic of a feeling among many that wavering in the face of any threat is a sign of weakness or giving up. Rhetoric suggesting that younger people are overreacting to the coronavirus &ndash; or that the elderly will easily weather it &ndash; features regular references to the war, and the no-fuss personalities it apparently forged</p>
<p>The 84-year-old writer of a piece titled &ldquo;I survived rationing, I&rsquo;m not scared of the coronavirus,&rdquo; published in the The Sunday Times last week, mentioned that he&rsquo;d spoken to others his age who were also sick of &ldquo;ageist propaganda,&rdquo; and scoffed at thirty-something &ldquo;scaredy-cats.&rdquo; Misapplied references to &ldquo;Blitz spirit&rdquo; often create a sense of continuing on without allowing normal life to be impeded, rather than acknowledging that the history in question involved a huge sacrifice of personal freedoms.</p>
<p>The sense that a lockdown marks the banishment of hard-won liberties &ndash; as opposed to a necessary public safety intervention &ndash; has even been reflected by royals&rsquo; favorite newspaper. On Tuesday, the first day of the UK lockdown, The Telegraph, whose average reader as of 2018 was 61-years-old according to its own data &ndash; the oldest audience for a British news brand, according to marketing site The Drum &ndash; led with the front page splash: &ldquo;The End Of Freedom.&rdquo; On the same day, the paper ran a column titled &ldquo;The self-pitying &lsquo;woke&rsquo; generation needed a war. In the coronavirus, they&rsquo;ve got one.&rdquo; The heavy implication is that anyone who has lived through greater privations than millennials need not bother themselves with new disasters, for they already have the necessary coping mechanisms to weather them.</p>
<p>Considering that so much media messaging has been confused, it is no wonder that many feel they don&rsquo;t need to make concessions to the coronavirus &ndash; either because they have already paid their dues, or because it is simply an overblown fuss. But the seriousness with which Clarence House has dealt with Prince Charles&rsquo; diagnosis &ndash; despite his apparently mild symptoms &ndash; sends a clear message to that isolation isn&rsquo;t just for one&rsquo;s own sake. It could prompt a rethink among those who have so far assumed that the advice to self-isolate doesn&rsquo;t apply to them.</p>

<p>For many, it probably seems antithetical that the heroic thing to do in this moment is totally at odds with ideas of heroism many have had their whole lives. But as Prince Charles has demonstrated, the best thing to do right now is to keep calm, and stay inside.

<h3 id="the-duchess-of-cornwall-shares-heartfelt-message-after-husband-prince-charles-tests-positive-for-coronavirus">The Duchess of Cornwall shares heartfelt message after husband Prince Charles tests positive for coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/royalty/2020032787049/duchess-cornwall-message-twitter-victims-abuse/0-418-40/camilla-message-twitter-t.jpg" alt="img">
The Duchess of Cornwall shares heartfelt message after husband Prince Charles tests positive for COVID-19 Camilla urged women isolating at home with an abusive partner to seek help if needed</p>
<p>The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken out following Prince Charles&rsquo; revelation earlier this week that he has tested positive for COVID-19 to urge women isolating at home with an abusive partner to seek help if needed.The royal offered the advice via Clarence House&rsquo;s official Twitter account, saying: &ldquo;This is a hard time for everyone, as we are all asked to stay at home to stay safe. But for some of you it is even harder, because home is not a safe place.</p>

<p>WATCH: The royal children clap for the NHS</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only imagine that being asked to stay there could feel very isolating and frightening for you and your family. It may mean spending more time with the person who is harming you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this is your situation, or you are worried about someone else, I want you to know that you are not alone.</p>
<p>Prince Charles&rsquo; wife continued: &ldquo;Even if you cannot leave your home, you can call the National Domestic Abuse Helpline or contact one of the domestic violence charities. Please stay safe and get help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother-of-two ended her plea telling women that if they felt in immediate danger, they should phone 999 and ask for the police.</p>
<p>Camilla, 72, has spoken out on behalf of the victims of domestic violence in the past. Just earlier this month the royal delivered a powerful speech as she spoke out against the &ldquo;heinous&rdquo; problem of domestic abuse at the Women of the World Festival. The duchess, who is president of the organisation, addressed the &lsquo;corrosive&rsquo; effect that the issue can have, saying: &ldquo;I find it almost impossible to think that any friend of mine might be living under that horrific threat, without my knowing it, but that is the power of coercive control and violence in the home. It is characterised by silence – silence from those that suffer – silence from those around them, and silence from those who perpetrate abuse.</p>
<p>📞If you are in immediate danger, please call 999 and ask for the police.</p>
<p>☎️ If you are not in immediate danger, please call one of the following 24 hour helplines:</p>
<p>England: 0808 2000 247</p>
<p>Northern Ireland: 0808 802 1414</p>
<p>Scotland: 0800 027 1234</p>
<p>Wales: 0808 8010 800 — Clarence House (@ClarenceHouse) March 27, 2020</p>
<p>PHOTOS: Inside Prince Charles and Camilla&rsquo;s Scottish home where they are self-isolating due to coronavirus</p>
<p>&ldquo;This silence is corrosive; it leaves women, children and men carrying the burden of shame. It prevents them from speaking out about the abuse and it prevents them from getting help. And at its worst it can be fatal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her speech, the Duchess also encouraged both men and women to raise awareness of the &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; subject and used her very first hashtag #everyonesproblem.

<h3 id="royal-fans-are-furious-that-prince-charles-traveled-to-scotland-amid-his-coronavirus-diagnosis">Royal Fans Are Furious That Prince Charles Traveled to Scotland Amid His Coronavirus Diagnosis</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/favicon.ico?x78437" alt="img">
Like the rest of the world, the Britsh royal family is being rocked by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. When whispers of the virus first hit the U.K., Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and the rest of the royal family were carrying on as usual. From meetings to events surrounded by hundreds of people, they seemed unaware of the severity of the virus.</p>
<p>Since then, all of the royal family members have been practicing social distancing and self-isolation. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip are currently in Windsor away from London. The Cambridges are quarantining at Kensington Place with their three children. The Sussexes have been in self-isolation on Vancouver Island in Canada, and Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall have been quarantined in Scotland.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Prince Charles has revealed that after experiencing mild symptoms he has been diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19). He is still in good health. However, the prince’s diagnosis and recent travel has angered many royal fans.</p>
<p>Prince Charles has been diagnosed with the coronavirus</p>
<p>The British royal family have all been practicing social distancing and self-quarantining. However, a spokesperson for the Prince of Wales revealed that he has been diagnosed with the virus. His wife, the Duchess of Cornwall does not have the virus.</p>
<p>“In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland,” a statement from Clarence House read. “The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing. It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.”</p>
<p>So far, we know that Prince Charles has been in communication with his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. Also, Queen Elizabeth II remains in good health.</p>
<p>This crisis has brought the British royal family closer together</p>
<p>Though there were admitted tension between Prince William and Prince Harry as well as the Sussexes with the royal family overall, this virus has helped them extend their hands to one another.</p>
<p>“Meghan told her inner circle of friends that Harry has been communicating with Prince William and the Queen on a pretty consistent basis,” an insider told Daily Mail. “She said this world crisis has actually brought them all closer together, especially Harry and his brother. Harry has made it very clear to them that he will do whatever he can to help from Canada. Meghan said they are grateful, especially Harry, that they could spend time with his family before all this insanity began.”</p>
<p>Royal fans are furious about Prince Charles traveling to Scotland</p>
<p>Prince Charles had traveled from London to Scotland to self-isolate when he learned about his coronavirus diagnosis. Royal fans are furious that the prince did not follow government advice immediately, and instead he traveled to his country home, possibly spreading the disease.</p>
<p>“As with everyone who has COVID-19, wishing Prince Charles a speedy recovery,” renowned Scottish sports reporter Derek Rae wrote. “But it’s perfectly legitimate to question why he and advisors thought it wasn’t reckless to decamp to Balmoral this past weekend, at a time when Scottish govt advice (or common sense) said otherwise.”</p>
<p>Another Twitter user said, “This is selfish move they should head advice like everybody else. They should be told by the police to return to London.” A third royal fan quipped, “He could have infected the staff at Balmoral and possibly many in the community. Entirely selfish.” Yet another person wondered, “Sympathy to him for having CV symptoms. But this epitomises the enduring power of privilege. Dare no MP raise this?”</p>
<p>We wish Prince Charles and everyone diagnosed with COVID-19 a speedy recovery.</p>
