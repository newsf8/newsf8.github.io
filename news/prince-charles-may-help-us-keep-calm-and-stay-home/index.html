<p>(CNN) On Wednesday, the morning of the UK&rsquo;s second day under lockdown after a stay-at-home order issued by Boris Johnson, the news broke that Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s eldest son and heir to the British throne, has tested positive for coronavirus. He&rsquo;s currently self-isolating with mild symptoms in Balmoral, Scotland. His wife Camilla, who tested negative for the virus, is self-isolating in a separate part of the estate. His 93-year-old mother the Queen is isolating at Windsor Castle, alongside her husband Prince Philip, who is 98. Many will be able to relate to the experience of separation from their loved ones during the current outbreak. At least, the royals have provided a conspicuous example of how seriously everyone should treat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As is always the case with breaking news about the royals, it spread like wildfire, immediately prompting questions like &ldquo;how many servants serve his breakfast?&rdquo; &ldquo;why did he get a test when my grandma didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and, of course, &ldquo;when did he last see his mum?&rdquo; (March 12, by the way, and a royal source told CNN that Charles had been advised he was contagious from March 13.)</p>
<p>It is unlikely that much of the population will remain unaware of the Prince&rsquo;s status for long. And in a country which &ndash; like the US &ndash; has seen some of its older and more at-risk inhabitants hesitate to treat the coronavirus as a serious threat to their own health, this might prove to be a much-needed injection of public awareness about the urgent risks involved in not heeding the orders to stay home.</p>
<p>There have been troubling reports from both sides of the pond about people failing to comply with government guidelines to stay isolated to stem the tide of the coronavirus. Many of those reports have focused thus far on spring breakers and St Patrick&rsquo;s Day partiers &ndash; but there have also been conspicuous instances of older people who appear reluctant to take public health messaging to heart.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a 75-year-old caller to BBC Radio Solent said that people in her age bracket didn&rsquo;t care whether they caught the virus, as they&rsquo;d &ldquo;had their lives,&rdquo; and that if people are &ldquo;going to get it,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re &ldquo;going to get it anyway.&rdquo; Last week, Woman&rsquo;s Hour, a popular BBC Radio show with a broad listenership, featured a caller in her 80s who &ndash; in the presenter&rsquo;s words &ndash; was &ldquo;incandescent&rdquo; with rage at what she felt had been patronizing government advice intended to see her left alone in her house &ldquo;to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have many friends who report their own frustrations with older parents who remain unconvinced that they should give up socializing, keeping regular appointments, or visiting family &ndash; despite the clear evidence that such behavior contributes directly to the coronavirus&rsquo; spread, and puts them at huge personal risk. It&rsquo;s clearly a common problem &ndash; and much advice in the lifestyle sections of various news sites has been aimed at millennials attempting to convince their elderly relatives that continuing as normal is dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable why this has been a hard pill to swallow for some. The beloved &ldquo;Keep Calm and Carry On&rdquo;-style rhetoric of World War II is emblematic of a feeling among many that wavering in the face of any threat is a sign of weakness or giving up. Rhetoric suggesting that younger people are overreacting to the coronavirus &ndash; or that the elderly will easily weather it &ndash; features regular references to the war, and the no-fuss personalities it apparently forged</p>
<p>The 84-year-old writer of a piece titled &ldquo;I survived rationing, I&rsquo;m not scared of the coronavirus,&rdquo; published in the The Sunday Times last week, mentioned that he&rsquo;d spoken to others his age who were also sick of &ldquo;ageist propaganda,&rdquo; and scoffed at thirty-something &ldquo;scaredy-cats.&rdquo; Misapplied references to &ldquo;Blitz spirit&rdquo; often create a sense of continuing on without allowing normal life to be impeded, rather than acknowledging that the history in question involved a huge sacrifice of personal freedoms.</p>
<p>The sense that a lockdown marks the banishment of hard-won liberties &ndash; as opposed to a necessary public safety intervention &ndash; has even been reflected by royals&rsquo; favorite newspaper. On Tuesday, the first day of the UK lockdown, The Telegraph, whose average reader as of 2018 was 61-years-old according to its own data &ndash; the oldest audience for a British news brand, according to marketing site The Drum &ndash; led with the front page splash: &ldquo;The End Of Freedom.&rdquo; On the same day, the paper ran a column titled &ldquo;The self-pitying &lsquo;woke&rsquo; generation needed a war. In the coronavirus, they&rsquo;ve got one.&rdquo; The heavy implication is that anyone who has lived through greater privations than millennials need not bother themselves with new disasters, for they already have the necessary coping mechanisms to weather them.</p>
<p>Considering that so much media messaging has been confused, it is no wonder that many feel they don&rsquo;t need to make concessions to the coronavirus &ndash; either because they have already paid their dues, or because it is simply an overblown fuss. But the seriousness with which Clarence House has dealt with Prince Charles&rsquo; diagnosis &ndash; despite his apparently mild symptoms &ndash; sends a clear message to that isolation isn&rsquo;t just for one&rsquo;s own sake. It could prompt a rethink among those who have so far assumed that the advice to self-isolate doesn&rsquo;t apply to them.</p>

<p>For many, it probably seems antithetical that the heroic thing to do in this moment is totally at odds with ideas of heroism many have had their whole lives. But as Prince Charles has demonstrated, the best thing to do right now is to keep calm, and stay inside.

<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1261474.jpg" alt="img">
It is not known how Prince Charles caught the coronavirus but two weeks ago he did attend a WaterAid event with Prince Albert II of Monaco. However, the two royals did not shake hands.</p>
<p>Royal commentator Alastair Bruce told Sky News Australia: &ldquo;Like everyone, members of the Royal Family are looked after by the NHS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NHS Scotland will have been responsible for looking after the Prince of Wales while he is up there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a local doctor in that area who looks after the Queen’s Court when they go up in the summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that this is the person who would have gone along to see the Prince of Wales and done the analysis as to whether he was suffering from COVID-19 or not.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="prince-charles-has-personal-assistant-and-someone-preparing-food-as-he-recovers-from-coronavirus">Prince Charles has &lsquo;personal assistant and someone preparing food&rsquo; as he recovers from coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/27/17/26497622-0-image-a-17_1585330084253.jpg" alt="img">
Prince Charles is being cared for by two staff members rather than his usual entourage as he recovers from coronavirus on the Balmoral estate, a source has claimed.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales, 71, has a &lsquo;mild&rsquo; form of the illness and is at his Scottish retreat with his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who has tested negative and is without any symptoms of the virus, which has killed 465 and infected 9,500 more in the UK so far.</p>
<p>In keeping with the government&rsquo;s guidance, he has been self-isolating and will continue to do so for 14 days - and, as a result, has been forced to do more for himself after paring back his staff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a personal assistant on had to assist and someone preparing his food and that is it,&rsquo; a source said, as reported by Katie Nicholl, for Vanity Fair. &lsquo;The food is taken to the door, the staff member retreats, and the prince takes his meal. The door is then shut and remains shut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales, 71, is being cared for by two staff members as he recovers from coronavirus at his Scottish retreat, a source said, speaking to Vanity Fair. Pictured, at dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort at Mansion House on March 12, 2020 in London</p>
<p>Charles has a &lsquo;mild&rsquo; form of the illness and is on the Balmoral estate with his wife Camilla, who has tested negative and is without any symptoms of the virus. Pictured, a photo shared by Clarence House to celebrate St Patrick&rsquo;s Day</p>
<p>The publication went on to explain that Charles has been well enough to receive several business calls with the chief executive of the International Rescue Committee and the chief executive of the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Prince might be in isolation, but he is not isolated, he is very busy and very much keeping abreast of what is happening,&rsquo; a source added. &lsquo;He is taking calls, having online meetings and working as hard as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The revelation that he has cut back to just &lsquo;two members of staff&rsquo; comes after the Prince of Wales was previously branded a &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; man to work for by an insider.</p>
<p>Despite his jolly public demeanor, the Prince is said to be very precise in his orders, and is reportedly aware he is less popular than the Queen.</p>
<p>A source told The Express: &lsquo;For some of those who serve in his household, he&rsquo;s difficult to work with. You&rsquo;ve got to do what he says, he is very hard work,&rsquo; they added of the royal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prince Charles does not like some palace staff. When the time comes for him to be king, he will make some people redundant. '</p>
<p>Prince Charles and his wife Camilla are in self-isolation in Scotland but his aides are trying to find anyone he may have met after becoming contagious on March 13</p>
<p>According to the insider, Charles is aware he is not as popular as his mother, following a 2017 YouGov poll which supported this theory.</p>
<p>And a book by Britain&rsquo;s top investigative author Tom Bower also told of Charles&rsquo; remarkable travel demands including bringing his entire bedroom on trips.</p>
<p>He penned: &lsquo;Before a visit to one friend in North-East England, he sent his staff ahead a day early with a truck carrying furniture to replace the perfectly appropriate fittings in the guest rooms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And not just the odd chest of drawers: the truck contained nothing less than Charles and Camilla&rsquo;s complete bedrooms, including the Prince&rsquo;s orthopaedic bed, along with his own linen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His staff had also made sure to pack a small radio, Charles&rsquo;s own lavatory seat, rolls of Kleenex Premium Comfort lavatory paper, Laphroaig whisky and bottled water (for both bedrooms), plus two landscapes of the Scottish Highlands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yesterday Charles thanked well-wishers for hundreds of &lsquo;get well soon&rsquo; messages after he contracted coronavirus, with Clarence House saying he was &lsquo;enormously touched&rsquo; by all the kind words he had received.</p>
<p>Charles&rsquo;s doctor believes the royal may have been contagious from March 13 at the earliest - just 24 hours after he last saw his 93-year-old mother the Queen, who is in self-isolation at Windsor Castle with Prince Philip, 98.
