<p>(CNN) On Wednesday, the morning of the UK&rsquo;s second day under lockdown after a stay-at-home order issued by Boris Johnson, the news broke that Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s eldest son and heir to the British throne, has tested positive for coronavirus. He&rsquo;s currently self-isolating with mild symptoms in Balmoral, Scotland. His wife Camilla, who tested negative for the virus, is self-isolating in a separate part of the estate. His 93-year-old mother the Queen is isolating at Windsor Castle, alongside her husband Prince Philip, who is 98. Many will be able to relate to the experience of separation from their loved ones during the current outbreak. At least, the royals have provided a conspicuous example of how seriously everyone should treat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As is always the case with breaking news about the royals, it spread like wildfire, immediately prompting questions like &ldquo;how many servants serve his breakfast?&rdquo; &ldquo;why did he get a test when my grandma didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and, of course, &ldquo;when did he last see his mum?&rdquo; (March 12, by the way, and a royal source told CNN that Charles had been advised he was contagious from March 13.)</p>
<p>It is unlikely that much of the population will remain unaware of the Prince&rsquo;s status for long. And in a country which &ndash; like the US &ndash; has seen some of its older and more at-risk inhabitants hesitate to treat the coronavirus as a serious threat to their own health, this might prove to be a much-needed injection of public awareness about the urgent risks involved in not heeding the orders to stay home.</p>
<p>There have been troubling reports from both sides of the pond about people failing to comply with government guidelines to stay isolated to stem the tide of the coronavirus. Many of those reports have focused thus far on spring breakers and St Patrick&rsquo;s Day partiers &ndash; but there have also been conspicuous instances of older people who appear reluctant to take public health messaging to heart.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a 75-year-old caller to BBC Radio Solent said that people in her age bracket didn&rsquo;t care whether they caught the virus, as they&rsquo;d &ldquo;had their lives,&rdquo; and that if people are &ldquo;going to get it,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re &ldquo;going to get it anyway.&rdquo; Last week, Woman&rsquo;s Hour, a popular BBC Radio show with a broad listenership, featured a caller in her 80s who &ndash; in the presenter&rsquo;s words &ndash; was &ldquo;incandescent&rdquo; with rage at what she felt had been patronizing government advice intended to see her left alone in her house &ldquo;to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have many friends who report their own frustrations with older parents who remain unconvinced that they should give up socializing, keeping regular appointments, or visiting family &ndash; despite the clear evidence that such behavior contributes directly to the coronavirus&rsquo; spread, and puts them at huge personal risk. It&rsquo;s clearly a common problem &ndash; and much advice in the lifestyle sections of various news sites has been aimed at millennials attempting to convince their elderly relatives that continuing as normal is dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable why this has been a hard pill to swallow for some. The beloved &ldquo;Keep Calm and Carry On&rdquo;-style rhetoric of World War II is emblematic of a feeling among many that wavering in the face of any threat is a sign of weakness or giving up. Rhetoric suggesting that younger people are overreacting to the coronavirus &ndash; or that the elderly will easily weather it &ndash; features regular references to the war, and the no-fuss personalities it apparently forged</p>
<p>The 84-year-old writer of a piece titled &ldquo;I survived rationing, I&rsquo;m not scared of the coronavirus,&rdquo; published in the The Sunday Times last week, mentioned that he&rsquo;d spoken to others his age who were also sick of &ldquo;ageist propaganda,&rdquo; and scoffed at thirty-something &ldquo;scaredy-cats.&rdquo; Misapplied references to &ldquo;Blitz spirit&rdquo; often create a sense of continuing on without allowing normal life to be impeded, rather than acknowledging that the history in question involved a huge sacrifice of personal freedoms.</p>
<p>The sense that a lockdown marks the banishment of hard-won liberties &ndash; as opposed to a necessary public safety intervention &ndash; has even been reflected by royals&rsquo; favorite newspaper. On Tuesday, the first day of the UK lockdown, The Telegraph, whose average reader as of 2018 was 61-years-old according to its own data &ndash; the oldest audience for a British news brand, according to marketing site The Drum &ndash; led with the front page splash: &ldquo;The End Of Freedom.&rdquo; On the same day, the paper ran a column titled &ldquo;The self-pitying &lsquo;woke&rsquo; generation needed a war. In the coronavirus, they&rsquo;ve got one.&rdquo; The heavy implication is that anyone who has lived through greater privations than millennials need not bother themselves with new disasters, for they already have the necessary coping mechanisms to weather them.</p>
<p>Considering that so much media messaging has been confused, it is no wonder that many feel they don&rsquo;t need to make concessions to the coronavirus &ndash; either because they have already paid their dues, or because it is simply an overblown fuss. But the seriousness with which Clarence House has dealt with Prince Charles&rsquo; diagnosis &ndash; despite his apparently mild symptoms &ndash; sends a clear message to that isolation isn&rsquo;t just for one&rsquo;s own sake. It could prompt a rethink among those who have so far assumed that the advice to self-isolate doesn&rsquo;t apply to them.</p>

<p>For many, it probably seems antithetical that the heroic thing to do in this moment is totally at odds with ideas of heroism many have had their whole lives. But as Prince Charles has demonstrated, the best thing to do right now is to keep calm, and stay inside.

The British royal family are taking all the right precautions in trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. With the Queen now retreating to Windsor Castle and Prince Charles in Scotland, the royals are currently self-isolating with a reduced workforce in a bid to take extra care for themselves as well as the health of their staff. On Wednesday, it was confirmed that Princes Charles, who is residing as his Scottish residence in Birkhall on the Balmoral Estate, had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>WATCH: Prince Charles tests positive for coronavirus</p>
<p>Although Charles and his wife Camilla are self-isolating separately, they have a small number of domestic staff who have stayed on. HELLO! understands the royal household is following the appropriate advice. Prince Charles and Camilla are currently living with six members of staff, who are remaining separate from the royal couple.</p>

<p>Former royal doctor Anna Hemming recently gave HELLO! an insight into the royals&rsquo; caring nature behind-the-scenes towards the palace workers. Anna, who worked at Buckingham Palace for seven years during her time as a GP for the royal household, revealed that it is likely the royals will provide a special isolation unit for their staff. &ldquo;They live within a very large establishment and Buckingham Palace is almost run like a big hotel and there are lots of people living within close proximity to each other,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Camilla are in Scotland</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example the housemaids&rsquo; floor, they live very close together so I am sure that they will be making sure that everyone is fit and healthy. Nobody is going to be mixing if they are not well, I am sure that they have an isolation unit set up for the staff, they will be looking after them really well.&rdquo; The Queen and the rest of the royal family have also been adapting their diaries and the way they work in light of the current pandemic. She has been conducting her weekly audiences with Prime Minister Boris Johnson by telephone.</p>

<p>Other members of the royal family have also postponed and cancelled a number of their engagements, and they are currently adapting their plans in line with the UK government&rsquo;s advice. Prince William released a video message to launch The National Emergencies Trust&rsquo;s appeal to raise money for charities helping vulnerable people during the crisis, while his uncle the Earl of Wessex participated in a video conference in relation to the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s International Award Foundation last week.</p>

Clarence House&rsquo;s announcement on Wednesday, that Prince Charles had contracted coronavirus, shocked the world. Fears were quickly sparked on whether other Royal Family members had tested positive for the deadly disease, most notably the Queen. Royals podcast hosts Angela Mollard and Zoe Burrell warned the entire Royal Family could already have coronavirus and gotten it from Prince Charles on one of the family&rsquo;s last public engagements on March 9th.</p>
