<p>The coronavirus scare has offered enough fodder for dubious tabloids. So much so, rustling up fake death bed reports have become commonplace. The latest celeb in line to have caught the fancy of gossip mills happens to be American singer Cher.</p>
<p>As per a recent report on the “Globe,” the 74-year-old who has been battling a rare disease since the 1980s is “scarily ill.” The report, which goes by an outrageously demeaning headline &ndash; “Sick Cher Knocking on Heaven’s Door” comprises a volley of questionable sources dropping “details” about the legendary singer&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>“Cher wouldn’t have missed the marches unless she absolutely couldn’t get up. Everyone is convinced she is on her deathbed,” said an alleged source, citing how the singer was too sick to attend the protests against police brutality in the wake of George Floyd Killing in Minneapolis Police Custody.</p>
<p>While it is believable to an extent that Cher was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus since the 1980s, which could have posed some health concerns, it is far from true that the singer is grappling under a deadly disease of sorts. More so because Cher has been managing quite well despite the health condition.</p>
<p>The publication takes things a little too far, after quoting a life expert give his stance on the entire so-called observation &ndash; “People who suffer from chronic fatigue can keep that disease for the rest of their lives.”</p>
<p>Well, it didn’t take much for Gossip Cop to bust the story, as the report fails to support its claims with any evidence. Furthermore, Cher’s rep rubbished the report and brushed it aside as a bogus click-baity narrative. What needs to be noted is that Cher, who the “Globe” alleges to be seriously ill for the past couple of weeks, is, in reality, alive and kicking. Cher has been extremely vocal about the current state of affairs on Twitter. How is it possible for a terminally ill patient to spring into action and be equipped to be vocal about world affairs on social media?</p>
<p>Also, if the report is to be believed, how was it possible for Cher to drop a fresh track last month for UNICEF if she has indeed been “out of breath” or “extremely unwell” for the past couple of months?</p>
<p>Case in point: The narrative is purely baseless, with zero relevance to Cher’s current state of health. She’s probably concerned about the pandemic and might be exercising extra precaution owing to a health condition, but is still miles away from her death bed.</p>

“Cher wouldn’t have missed the marches unless she absolutely couldn’t get up. Everyone is convinced she is on her deathbed,” a so-called source tells the publication. The story notes how the singer has been dealing with the Epstein-Barr virus since the 1980s which has now left her “depressed” and “bedridden” for months on end but also “wreaked havoc on her kidneys and heart.” The outlet then quotes a “life span” expert, who hasn’t treated Cher, but adds, “People who suffer from chronic fatigue can keep that disease for the rest of their lives.” The outlet then concludes for Cher, “that may not be much longer.”

<h3 id="cher-ruthlessly-slammed-madonna-as-rude-and-not-beautiful-during-30-year-feud">&ldquo;Cher ruthlessly slammed Madonna as &lsquo;rude and not beautiful&rsquo; during 30 year feud&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article22210732.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Womens-March-on-Washington-Rally.jpg" alt="img">
Cher has been unforgiving with her thoughts on Madonna and over 30 years, took plenty of opportunities to shade the singer.</p>
<p>A classic case of this has resurfaced with an interview on talk show Wogan, from 1991, with Cher in catty form as she shared her thoughts on the Material Girl singer.</p>
<p>Cher is seen telling chat show host Terry Wogan that Madonna is &ldquo;not beautiful&rdquo; and also &ldquo;not unbelievably talented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair have been feuding for over 30 years and Cher was more than happy to share her feelings on Madonna, now 61, when prompted by Wogan during the BBC interview.</p>
<p>(Image: WireImage)</p>
<p>Knowing that it was a bit frosty between the pair, he asked: &ldquo;Do you go jogging like Madonna to keep fit?”</p>
<p>Cher jokingly replied: &ldquo;Well, you mean like my best friend, Madonna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the studio audience laughed at the quip, Wogan is heard saying to Cher: &ldquo;I thought that was a subtle way to drag her in, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cher was beginning to get the taste for rinsing Madonna and hit back: &ldquo;How about dragging her in by her hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wogan then devilishly prompted: &ldquo;You’re not that keen on Madonna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a cue for Cher to open a can of diatribe on Madonna as she started voicing exactly what she didn&rsquo;t like about her.</p>
<p>Cher began by saying that she felt the feud had been misrepresented before adding some below the belt comments.</p>
<p>(Image: BBC)</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Well, you know what, it’s really gotten to be so blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was in America, I mean it’s not like you go around saying ‘this is how I feel,’ but someone said to me, ‘What do you think about her?’ I said, ‘She’s unbelievably creative…. because in my day, I was pretty good at doing the same thing that she’s doing, but she does it so much better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She’s unbelievably creative because she’s not unbelievably talented, she’s not beautiful, but she’s kind of, she’s rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cher continued: &ldquo;And so, the man said, ‘How do you feel about her?’ I said, ‘Well, she’s nice, she’s creative, but she’s rude.’ Then, I used another word and they bleeped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: BBC)</p>
<p>Cher added that while she has some admiration for Madonna, she never really saw eye-to-eye with her.</p>
<p>She recalled: &ldquo;I don’t really have anything against her. I do respect that she goes much farther than anyone should go, and I think that’s interesting about her that she’s willing to do whatever she wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Cher, who is now 74, voiced some negative thoughts about her foe and she was equally as cutting during a candid interview with CBS, also in 1991.</p>
<p>Cher said: &ldquo;There’s something about her that I don’t like. She’s … mean. I don’t like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember having her over to my house a couple of times, because [Sean Penn] and I were friends, and she just was so rude to everybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that she’s got so much that she doesn’t have to act that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)</p>
<p>In an expletive ending take down, Cher said: &ldquo;[Madonna] acts like a spoiled brat all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it seems to me when you reach the kind of acclaim that she’s reached - and you can do whatever you want to do - you should be a little bit more magnanimous, and a little bit less of a c***.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite there seeming to be a thawing in relationships in the intervening years, Cher reminded everyone in 2018 that she still has issues with Madonna.</p>
<p>While playing the &lsquo;Five Second Rule&rsquo; on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Cher was asked to name three singers that she would be willing to duet with.</p>
<p>She answered: &ldquo;Adele, Pink and not Madonna!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="cher-calling-madonna-not-beautiful-in-this-throwback-video-is-all-things-shady">&ldquo;Cher Calling Madonna ‘not Beautiful’ In THIS Throwback Video Is All Things ‘shady’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/vki5plwvpklhdtie_1592468753.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg" alt="img">
A recent throwback video of Cher taking a subtle jibe at Madonna is doing the rounds on social media. The video was from a 1991 interview of the singer with the late radio broadcaster Terry Worgan. The interview had Cher calling the Frozen singer &lsquo;not beautiful&rsquo; and &lsquo;not unbelievably talented.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Cher started making subtle digs at Madonna on the interview</p>
<p>During the interview, Terry could be seen jokingly asking Cher if she goes &lsquo;jogging&rsquo; with Madonna. To this, she hilariously asks him, &lsquo;Do you mean, my best friend Madonna?&rsquo; which leaves the crowd in splits. Terry reveals to the Strong Enough singer that this was his way of dragging Madonna indirectly into the conversation. But, Cher soon suggests &lsquo;dragging Madonna by the hair&rsquo; which was just the beginning of the string of jibes.</p>

<p>Cher termed Madonna to be &lsquo;not unbelievably talented&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cher goes on to say that her whole enmity with Madonna was blown out of proportion. She goes on to &lsquo;praise&rsquo; the Vogue singer, but that soon turns out to be another of her subtle jibes on her. Cher reveals that someone had earlier asked her what does she think of Madonna. The Fernando singer recalled her answer to be that she finds Madonna to be &lsquo;unbelievably creative&rsquo; as she is not unbelievably talented.</p>

<p>Cher further revealed that she described the Hung Up singer to be rude and &lsquo;not beautiful&rsquo;. But, the After All singer also added that she does not have anything against Madonna and respects the fact that she has tasted success more than many people in her field. According to media reports, Cher also fuelled her rivalry with the Like A Virgin singer in the year 2018 when she made an appearance on Ellen Degeneres&rsquo; show.</p>
<p>Ellen had asked the Dark Lady singer to quickly name three singers with whom she would like to participate in a duet. To this, she quickly replied saying, &lsquo;Adele, Pink and &lsquo;not&rsquo; Madonna&rsquo;. Cher had also spoken about her rivalry with the Crazy For You singer to renowned journalist Steve Kmetko. The Half-Breed singer had revealed that she respects the fact that Madonna knows how to work in the business efficiently than anyone else. But, she went on to say that she finds the Justify My Love singer &lsquo;mean&rsquo; and that is the one thing she dislikes about her.</p>

Chaz Bono and Elijah Allman are half brothers, and although they share the same mother, the brothers have a difficult history together. Here is a look into their relationship.</p>
<p>Every family has their ups and downs and while some find a way to work around it; others tend to drift apart and move in different directions. Although ultimately, they might come back to the realization that family is perhaps one of the most important things.</p>
<p>Singer Cher&rsquo;s children, Chaz Bono and Elijah Allman, have had somewhat of a difficult history, and over the years, the brothers have sometimes tried to work on their relationship. Here is a look into their difficult relationship.</p>

<p>CHAZ AND ELIJAH AS KIDS</p>
<p>Growing up, Chaz and Elijah had a pretty close bond. When life was simpler and less complicated, the siblings were able to get along fine and support one another despite the seven-year age gap.</p>
<p>However, as they advanced in age and led different lifestyles, Chaz and Elijah&rsquo;s relationship slowly fizzled as each had their respective troubles to battle.</p>
<p>The half-siblings exposed to the life of fame from an early age each battled various issues. With Chaz&rsquo;s decision to become a transgender (Chaz was born female) and Elijah&rsquo;s battles with drugs, the two brothers ultimately drifted apart.</p>

<p>DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES</p>
<p>Chaz Bono was born female and named Chastity Sun Bono. From a young age, Chaz battled with his identity and decided to change from being female to male. Although the decision was difficult, Chaz made the transition and has been an advocate for the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>The brothers now have an improved relationship.</p>
<p>Elijah, on the other hand, had issues with authority while growing up, and when he was eight years old, Cher had him sent to a boarding school to keep him away from his father, Greg Allman, who used drugs heavily. Away from home, Elijah formed his ideals and found it challenging to blend when he returned home.</p>

<p>CHAZ AND ELIJAH AS ADULTS</p>
<p>Chaz and Elijah have both gone on to do relatively well for themselves outside of their famous parents&rsquo; fame in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Chaz has established himself as an actor with roles in various movies and series such as &ldquo;American Horror Story.&rdquo; He has also been an active advocate for the LGBTQ community, and his documentary &ldquo;Becoming Chaz&rdquo; was nominated three times for the Emmy Awards.</p>
<p>Elijah has also found a niche for himself in the music industry as a guitarist. He has worked with several bands over the years.</p>
<p>In 2013, he got married to Marie Angela King despite the disapproval of Cher. The couple eloped and got married in a private ceremony in front of their fireplace.</p>

<p>CHAZ, ELIJAH AND CHER&rsquo;S RELATIONSHIP</p>
<p>While Cher and her kids had several misunderstandings over the years, the three have tried to work on their relationship and come together as a family.</p>
<p>In a 2017 chat with Closer Weekly, Cher revealed that she and her kids have tried to mend their relationship, and they were absolutely the best kids one could ask for.</p>
<p>Although she acknowledged that they had made inevitable mistakes in the past, she was happy that her boys got along and that the family was in a more comfortable place.</p>
<p>In all, while Chaz and Elijah might have had their falling out over the years, the brothers now have an improved relationship, with themselves and their mother.

American singer Cher who helped Kaavan, an elephant at the Islamabad zoo, get freedom expressed, her gratitude towards Prime Minister Imran Khan. She said that she’d been a fan of the prime minister since his cricket days.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, the singer turned animal rights campaigner couldn’t contain her excitement and thanked many people including several Pakistani ministers and representatives.</p>
<p>“I was a big fan of you when you played cricket @ImranKhanPTI. I always thought you seemed so kind. Thank you so much for your help. This is a dream come true,” she tweeted.</p>

<p>In May, Pakistani court ordered freedom for a lonely elephant named Kaavan, who had become the subject of a high-profile rights campaign backed by the US singer.</p>
<p>Outrage over treatment of Kaavan, an Asian elephant originally from Sri Lanka, went global several years ago with a petition garnering over 200,000 signatures after it emerged he was being chained at the Islamabad Zoo in Pakistan’s leafy capital.</p>
<p>Zoo officials later said this was no longer the case, and that he just needed a new mate after his previous partner died in 2012.</p>
<p>But experts have told AFP previously that without a better habitat his future was bleak, even if a long-promised new mate finally arrives.</p>
<p>His behaviour—including signs of distress such as bobbing his head repeatedly—demonstrates “a kind of mental illness”, Safwan Shahab Ahmad of the Pakistan Wildlife Foundation told AFP in 2016.</p>
<p>His mate Saheli, who arrived also from Sri Lanka in 1990, died in 2012, and in 2015 it emerged that Kaavan was regularly being chained once more for several hours a day.</p>
<p>Scores of people signed a petition sent to zoo authorities and Pakistan’s then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in protest.</p>
<p>A second petition circulated in 2016 and backed by over 200,000 animal-lovers from across the globe demanded Kaavan’s release to a sanctuary.</p>
<p>Cher, who for years has spoken out about Kaavan’s plight, tweeted her thanks to the Pakistani government, adding “it’s so emotional for us that I have to sit Down”.
