College Student Wonders: In Hardcore Kenya, Is COVID-19 Lockdown Needed?</p>
<p>As Kenya shuts down to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, one young Kenyan says his country has a lot of other threats to worry about.</p>
<p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:</p>
<p>In Kenya, the government has ordered a full lockdown, and those rules will be enforced by security forces if needed. But many people are still walking the streets, and some ask, is this really necessary in a region with so many other threats? NPR&rsquo;s Eyder Peralta reports.</p>
<p>EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: In this time of coronavirus, I meet Samuel Mang&rsquo;era (ph) in an empty hotel bar. He sits way across the table from me. I&rsquo;m thinking, the millions of coronavirus particles released in a sneeze or a cough won&rsquo;t make it all the way here. He unlocks his phone and begins to read his Facebook post.</p>
<p>SAMUEL MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) This is an open letter. Dear coronavirus, welcome to Kenya.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Kenya has so far reported 25 cases of COVID-19. They&rsquo;ve ordered a lockdown and have asked people to stay home indefinitely.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) A few things you should know - here, we don&rsquo;t die of flu. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you fail to succeed. Everything fails in Kenya.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Mang&rsquo;era, a college student who acts and writes, reacted by writing this poem on Facebook. Kenya is not excited to host coronavirus, he writes. The locusts, the biggest infestation in 75 years, got here first.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) We also cannot afford to pay you too much attention because we are really, really broke.</p>
<p>PERALTA: I look at him - he&rsquo;s a slim guy with a wry smile - and tell him while this is funny, it&rsquo;s also really sad. He says that&rsquo;s what he wanted to capture - the humor you have to have to live in this tough a place.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: These things come and go. We just have to accept.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Even without coronavirus, death is everywhere here. The roads are filled with these station wagons that are called Proboxes. In Japan, they were recalled by the manufacturer for being dangerous. But here, Proboxes provide essential transport.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: In Kenya, we survive by Probox. You will get 15 people bundled in the same Probox.</p>
<p>PERALTA: So the same thing that is just killing people in other places - here, it&rsquo;s a way of life.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: It&rsquo;s more of a way of life because we don&rsquo;t have an alternative.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Samuel Mang&rsquo;era turns back to his phone. His open letter to coronavirus is full of bravado. But it is also an admission of deep vulnerability.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) We are more likely to die of a cholera attack than to be killed by you. For us, every day is a run escape from death. We are the walking dead.</p>
<p>PERALTA: As he reads, I overhear the only other customer here talking about the coronavirus. Kenyans live hand to mouth. How will they stay home? How will they survive this lockdown? But death, Mang&rsquo;era reads, it can befall Kenyans any time.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) And we are not scared. If it comes, let it come. Why worry over what we can&rsquo;t control? Everything dies, right? Even you, corona, will die.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Even you, corona, will die.</p>

Read for fun and to acquire essential knowledge and to acquire skills.</p>
<p>To stay organised, identify the activities that you need to carry out during the period.</p>
<p>By JAMES KAHONGEH</p>
<p>More by this Author</p>
<p>You may have heard about a lockdown.</p>
<p>Also called confinement, this is a situation where people’s free movement is restricted as a security measure or health emergency.</p>
<p>When an area, state or country is on lockdown, schools shopping malls, offices and other public places may be shut down to allow the authorities to deal with the prevailing threat.</p>
<p>As the global pandemic of the coronavirus bites on, some countries around the world have declared a lockdown to curtail its spread.</p>
<p>China, for instance, has been on lockdown for nearly two months now, with only providers of healthcare and other critical services allowed to go out.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has also been providing families with food and other supplies during this time.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But what should you do in readiness for a lockdown?</p>
<p>What activities can you engage in at the time of a lockdown? Ordinarily, time flies, but during a lockdown, you suddenly have so much time with little to do.</p>
<p>The hours may seem to drag and days become longer.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that while it’s stressful and highly inconveniencing, a lockdown is a temporary experience.</p>
<p>Worth noting too is that there’s no one-size-fits-all way to prepare for a lockdown and that preparedness varies from case to case.</p>
<p>We sample some of steps you could take to cushion yourself and your family from the psychological distress and the inconvenience of this imposed isolation.</p>
<p>Get the essentials</p>
<p>Have a stockpile of food to last you for a considerable length of time.</p>
<p>Prioritise on non-perishable varieties such as rice, spaghetti, pasta, flour, maize mill, beans, green grams, powder milk, long life milk and breakfast cereals.</p>
<p>Stock your kitchen with salt, sugar, dry spices, ketchup, cooking oil and water treatment chemicals.</p>
<p>Refill your gas cylinder. For consumers of prepaid electricity, buy enough tokens –you can buy more on the go.</p>
<p>Have other alternative means of energy in the house just in case.</p>
<p>Buy enough drinking, washing an cooking water.</p>
<p>If you keep pets, stock up enough food for them.</p>
<p>Besides food, stock up other essentials such as toothpaste, soap, hand sanitisers, masks, gloves and toilet paper, pads, vinegar, bleach and methylated spirit.</p>
<p>Have enough medicine (such as painkillers, antihistamines, antacids, decongestants, cough syrup for children and bandages) in the house to take care of emergencies.</p>
<p>Prepare financially</p>
<p>Being caught up in a financial whirlwind during a lockdown can be devastating.</p>
<p>It’s especially troubling when you’re uncertain about when the situation is likely to end.</p>
<p>Savings usually come in handy to address any disruption of income.</p>
<p>If some people owe you, it’s probably time to ask them to pay up.</p>
<p>You could also renegotiate payment plans with your lenders to avoid a financial strain.</p>
<p>Have enough cash with you and mobile money.</p>
<p>Develop a routine</p>
<p>Having activities to do during this time will help you to stay productive and to keep boredom at bay.</p>
<p>To stay organised, identify the activities that you need to carry out during the period.</p>
<p>Cleaning, fitness training, working and minding the children should all have specific time allocations.</p>
<p>Set goals for each of these activities by the end of this period.</p>
<p>Make it a habit to strictly follow the timetable to avoid wastage of time and chaos.</p>
<p>Handling children</p>
<p>Taking care of children, while it may seem easy, is very strenuous task.</p>
<p>Having to spend weeks indoors with them can be particularly wearying, both physically and emotionally,</p>
<p>Psychologists advise that you look for activities that tire them out as much as possible.</p>
<p>The idea is to engage them closely and to keep them from mischief and distracting you from work.</p>
<p>Look up fun activities for children online.</p>
<p>Outdoor activities are recommended as it helps them with physical fitness.</p>
<p>Working remotely</p>
<p>You may be working from home already, which makes it slightly easier to cope in the event that a total lockdown is imposed.</p>
<p>Establish a strict but easy to follow work routine, by selecting flexible hours when you can be most productive.</p>
<p>To avoid distractions, choose the quietest room in the house to create a temporary office.</p>
<p>Have a desk, a laptop or a computer, a telephone (your smartphone should suffice), stationery and anything else that you need to work efficiently.</p>
<p>Even dress up for the work to break the monotony of pyjamas and t-shirt. When you dress up for work, you’re psychologically attuned to work.</p>
<p>Fitness is key</p>
<p>With a lockdown, you’ll obviously be cut off from your hangout places, including your gym.</p>
<p>With minimal movement and physical activities to perform, keeping fit is more important for not just those who work out frequently, but those who rarely do so as well.</p>
<p>Working out at home is cheaper, convenient and, with a little innovation, fun too.</p>
<p>It’s important to know the range of exercises that you can perform, and the equipment you need for this.</p>
<p>Cardio activities, stretches, rope jumps, sit-ups, squats and push-ups are easy to perform, and require no specialised equipment.</p>
<p>Buy skipping ropes, a training kit and a water bottle.</p>
<p>If you take a walk, do so.</p>
<p>Plan for entertainment</p>
<p>You will need to stay entertained during this period, to help you break the monotony of work, handling the kids and attending to household chores.</p>
<p>Build a music playlist to take you through the period of isolation and update it regularly.</p>
<p>Isolation allows you to watch a movie that you haven’t found time to watch yet.</p>
<p>Play computer games with your children.</p>
<p>Follow updates</p>
<p>With isolation, the media and social media are your only link to events happening in the world.</p>
<p>A time of a pandemic is high season for an information overload and misinformation.</p>
<p>Consume information only from credible media outlets and other reliable sources.</p>
<p>Minimise your social media use as this often a fertile ground for misleading information.</p>
<p>Reading is therapeutic</p>
<p>Watching too much news can be quite depressing, especially where thousands of infections and deaths are being reported.</p>
<p>Reading comes in handy as an escape from the depressing news and long hours on social media.</p>
<p>Read online stories, read blogs, books and magazines on your favourite topics.</p>
<p>Read for fun and to acquire essential knowledge and to acquire skills.</p>
<p>Avoid total isolation</p>
<p>A lockdown isn’t an excuse to be completely cut off from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Life goes on even with the confinement.</p>
<p>Being completely isolated may yield boredom and psychological unease.</p>
<p>Keep tabs on various things by engaging your friends on social media.</p>
<p>Occasionally call your workmates and know how they’re getting on. Video call them if possible.</p>
<p>Don’t be caught up out of place</p>
<p>Being in the wrong country at this time can be hugely inconveniencing.</p>
<p>It could cost you a lot of money that you may not have budgeted for.</p>
<p>Before travelling to a country at this time of the Coronavirus, find out about its isolation status.</p>
<p>Avoid travelling to countries that are on lockdown such as China, Italy and some states in the US.</p>
<p>If you must travel to such a country or region, do so before a lockdown has taken effect.</p>
<p>Seek professional help if necessary</p>
<p>The sudden change of routine may take a heavy toll on you. The ability to cope with such sharp changes varies with individuals.</p>
<p>If feeling overwhelmed, speak to a therapist for advice.</p>
<p>You can reach out through email, a phone call or a video chat.

<h3 id="leaders-urge-president-uhuru-to-impose-total-lockdown--the-standard">Leaders urge President Uhuru to impose total lockdown : The Standard</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/images/wednesday/leaders_urge_preside5e7b40fe75bda.jpg" alt="img">
Leaders urge President Uhuru to impose total lockdown</p>
<p>A section of Kenyan politicians have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to lockdown the country to curb the spread of coronavirus, others have however argued that a lockdown without a proper plan, could be a terrible idea. Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said that although a lockdown could be a vital move by the government, the state should first consider the 80 per cent of Kenyans who live from hand to mouth. “My take on the lockdown in the country is that the government should be able to impose a lockdown only if it is able to cater for the 80 per cent because a lockdown is not only necessary it is vital,&rdquo;</p>
<p>SEE ALSO :After Uhuru decision on housing, state must listen to people more</p>
<p>&ldquo;My suggestion is that we recall Members of Parliament so that they can enact a lockdown bill that allows all landlords to waive rent for the next three months,” he said. Kabogo also urged employees to pay their staff. “I am saying that they should be allowed to spend tax at source, desperate times call for desperate measures. Because if you send people on lockdown without a solution, they then will come out of their homes and they will go to homes where they think there is food, and this will end up in chaos,” he added.</p>
<p>BISHOPS: We fear corona like the devil - The Nairobian Read Now »</p>
<p>Nairobi lawyer Donald Kipkorir has however echoed Kabogo’s sentiments on a lockdown via his twitter account saying Kenyans will starve if the lockdown is enforced. “To lock down Kenya will be the most FOOLISH DECISION &amp; will unravel Kenya. 80 per cent of Kenyans live from day to day &amp; lockdown means that they will either starve to death or eat their healthy neighbours! Countries that have gone on lockdown are RICH. Kenya is Poor &amp; Corrupt,” tweeted Kipkorir.</p>
<p>SEE ALSO :The wars in Uhuru and Raila political parties</p>
<p>on Monday Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho asked Uhuru to declare a total lockdown in the country to stop the spread of the virus. Joho said Kenya should learn from Wuhan, China where shutdown of day-to-day activities proved effective in containing the spread of the pandemic. On Tuesday, Kenya confirmed nine new cases of coronavirus that brought the total cases to twenty-five. So far 428,217 cases have been reported worldwide and 19,101 deaths.</p>
