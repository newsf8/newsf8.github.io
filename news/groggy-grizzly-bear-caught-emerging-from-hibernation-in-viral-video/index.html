Ranger in Canadian Rockies says video she captured was ‘something everybody needed’ in a time of isolation</p>
<p>On a bright spring day, a hulking grizzly bear named Boo emerged from his winter den, shaking a dusting of snow from his thick coat as he looked around groggily.</p>
<p>The moment was filmed in a remarkable viral video – which also captures the elated reaction of one of the bear’s closest humans, the manager of grizzly refuge in the Canadian Rockies.</p>
<p>“Mama’s so proud of you! You are such a good sight,” exclaims Nicole Gangnon, in a clip filmed on her mobile phone which has racked up more 100,000 views on Twitter – many by people desperate for distraction from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Gangnon had her own reason to be cheerful, she later explained: she had tried unsuccessfully for eight years to document the bear’s emergence from hibernation.</p>
<p>“We’ve always set up trail cameras and our surveillance cameras,” Gangnon told the Guardian. “And it just seems like every time he decides to dig out, our technology fails us and we can never capture that moment.”</p>
<p>Pablo Escobar&rsquo;s &lsquo;cocaine hippos&rsquo; show how invasive species can restore a lost world Read more</p>
<p>Born in the wild, Boo now lives alone at the Grizzly Bear Refuge, a 20-acre enclosure on the property of the Kicking Horse ski resort in near the town of Golden.</p>
<p>After his mother was killed by poachers nearly in 2002, Boo arrived at the refuge with his brother Cari (the pair were named after the Cariboo Mountains where they were found).</p>
<p>Cari died from a twisted intestine during the pair’s first winter in the refuge, but Boo has thrived over the years, drawing thousands of tourists to his enclosure.</p>
<p>The log cabin den where Boo sleeps every winter – buried under two meters of snow – also doubles as makeshift laboratory and is designed to allow researchers to study bear hibernation.</p>
<p>On 17 March, Gangnon heard movement from the den and waited anxiously as Boo dug himself out.</p>
<p>“It’s just beautiful to see him face-to-face rather than on a camera. He’s so happy and that just makes your heart sing,” she said. “Once he gets up, you can see he’s got a grin on his face. He’s like: ‘Hello, world, here I am again.’”</p>
<p>“I was moved to tears that day. With the world so uncertain, it was something I needed. I think it was something everybody needed, to be honest,” said Gangnon. “It’s brought a lot of happiness into people’s world’s right now, when people are isolated. It’s really just helped people to see that the world will still go on.”</p>

Boo makes an appearance (Picture: grizzlygirl84/Instagram)</p>
<p>A huge grizzly bear named Boo has been captured on camera emerging from hibernation in Canada.</p>
<p>Incredibly rare footage shows the animal shaking snow from his fur as he pads into the sunshine for the first time this year.</p>
<p>In a video which has since gone viral, Nicole Gangnon – who manages a refuge near Golden, in the Canadian Rockies – films Boo poking his head out before he fully gets up.</p>
<p>Watching from within the 20-acre enclosure at the Kicking Horse ski resort, Nicole is beside herself, shouting: ‘Eight years it took me to catch this moment! Oh, my big boy! Mumma’s so proud of you!’</p>

<p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk after the March 17 arrival, she explained: ‘He typically emerges mid March, so I knew any day he would be up.</p>

<p>‘I was working near the den (and) I could hear him stir inside his den.</p>
<p>‘I heard him start to tunnel out through the snow… That’s when I grabbed my cell phone and got on top of the roof of his den and began filming.’</p>
<p>Nicole has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a decade to capture such a scene, with the log cabin under the snow where Boo hibernates also serving as a makeshift laboratory that can be used to learn about bears.</p>
<p>After his mum was killed by poachers in 2002, Boo arrived at the refuge with brother Cari, who died during their first winter at the refuge.</p>

<p>Boo came to the refuge with his brother who died in the pair’s first winter together (Picture: grizzlygirl84/Instagram)</p>
<p>But since then Boo has fascinated thousands of tourists at his enclosure.</p>
<p>Recalling when she first saw him this year, Nicole continued: ‘He knew I was there.</p>
<p>‘He can hear and even smell his surroundings even though he is under all that snow. Bears can smell about 2 metres through the snow and their nose is their best sense.</p>
<p>‘He is comfortable around me as I am one of his two primary caregivers, so he had no issues popping out with me right there.’</p>

<p>She added: ‘We have surveillance inside his den and can see his activity.</p>
<p>‘Bears are not true hibernators and the dormant state they enter is known as Torpor.</p>
<p>‘Hears will drop their heart beats to a mere eights beats per minute.</p>
<p>‘How incredible. They are truly remarkable at survival.’</p>
