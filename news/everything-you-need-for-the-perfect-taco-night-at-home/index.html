<p>Cooking at home, even for the most kitchen-adverse, has become the norm these days. And some of us might be stuck in a rut — especially when feeding several mouths, which probably means cooking for a variety of preferences. But there’s an easy and fun way to please everyone: taco night!</p>
<p>Taco nights have several things in their favor, the biggest being the opportunity for everyone to choose from the spread and craft something suited to their tastes.</p>
<p>And that’s just the beginning. There are usually leftovers, which means cooking will be off the menu the next night (hooray!). Plus, adults can whip up margaritas with a countertop margarita machine to make it feel like a night at their favorite taco place.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here’s everything you’ll need to create the perfect taco night at home, as recommended by chefs and our editors.</p>
<p>Cooking up the best taco fillings</p>
<p>The first step is cooking the main taco filling. Some classic favorites are chicken, beef, shrimp, fish and roasted veggies.</p>
<p>Boston based Chef Jason Santos, of Citrus and Salt Mexican Restaurant PHOTO: Jason Santos</p>
<p>For cooking beef, Boston-based chef Jason Santos, of Citrus and Salt Mexican restaurant — whose blue hair you may recognize from “Bar Rescue” — says, “I LOVE skirt steak. It is slightly chewy in a good way and takes on a marinade unbelievably, and because of the fat, chars up nicely.”</p>
<p>For chicken, if you have leftovers lying around that aren’t too strongly seasoned, this is the perfect opportunity to dice them and throw ‘em in a bowl for tacos. Or, get about a pound of boneless, skinless thighs and season them with cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Throw them in a skillet and cook completely, before dicing or shredding.</p>
<p>Of course, don’t forget that pulled pork, chorizo sausage and ground beef make tasty tacos, too.</p>
<p>Chicken Drumsticks, Four 18-Ounce Packs ($28; rastellis.com)</p>
<p>Rastelli&rsquo;s Chicken Drumsticks</p>
<p>Have the flavorful dark meat delivered straight to your home from Rastelli’s. (Here’s what we thought after we recently tried this meat delivery service.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Wild Caught Icelandic Cod Box ($45; rastellis.com)</p>
<p>Wild Caught Icelandic Cod Box</p>
<p>Try baking cod filets in the oven with a little olive oil, paprika, salt and pepper. This mild fish will flake right into your tortilla. Or hop on the air frying trend for a crispier option.</p>
<p>For a veggie taco, Santos says, “It’s a tie between either sweet potatoes or mushrooms. I love them both and they both hold up well in a taco.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Daring Plant-Based Chicken ($69; rastellis.com)</p>
<p>Daring Plant-Based Chicken</p>
<p>Another idea for veggie tacos? A plant-based meat substitute, like this one from Rastelli’s, that cooks up just like chicken.</p>
<hr>
<p>Frontera Red Chile Barbacoa Seasoning Sauce ($1.99; target.com)</p>
<p>Frontera Red Chile Barbacoa Seasoning Sauce</p>
<p>This mild beef marinade will give your skirt steak just the right kick of flavor.</p>
<hr>

<p>Badia Marinade Mojo Criollo, 20 oz</p>
<p>This classic lemon pepper marinade is perfect for seasoning skirt or flank steak for tacos.</p>
<hr>
<p>La Victoria Red Mild Sauce ($2.29; target.com)</p>
<p>La Victoria Red Mild Sauce</p>
<p>Another great option for beef, this red sauce also brings exciting flavor to chicken.</p>
<p>Prepping the best taco toppings</p>
<p>Taco toppings can vary wildly, from the traditional, like raw onions and cilantro, to lettuce, different styles of salsa, sour cream, guacamole, shredded cabbage and much more. The options, truly, are only limited by your imagination.</p>
<p>“Personally, I love pickled onions on tacos,” says Santos. “It adds a bright pop of acidity and color. The main items to have on hand include: citrus, salt, a good attitude and/or cilantro.”</p>
<p>TLP Molcajete Handmade Mexican Mortar and Pestle ($39.49; amazon.com)</p>
<p>TLP Molcajete Handmade Mexican Mortar and Pestle</p>
<p>This traditional Mexican molcajete (mortar and pestle) turns making homemade guacamole into a ritual in and of itself. It’s made of volcanic rock and is 8 inches across — large enough to make enough guac for an appetizer and a taco topping in one go. Another benefit is that you can make it and serve it in the same container. Hello, fewer dishes! Volcanic rock is cool and all, but if a budget option sounds even cooler, try this plastic, footed 56-Ounce Molcajete and Salsa Bowl ($15.87, originally $20.03; amazon.com).</p>
<hr>

<p>Extra tasty touches for the perfect taco bar</p>
<p>From a frozen margarita (nonalcoholic, if you prefer) to homemade crispy taco shells, these extra tasty touches will make the night memorable.</p>
<p>Margaritaville Bahamas Frozen Concoction Maker ($189.99; target.com)</p>
<p>Margaritaville Bahamas Frozen Concoction Maker</p>
<p>Before you start plating your tacos, rev up this top-rated margarita machine and make boozy (or virgin) frozen drinks to cool the crew. Keep it simple by using a tried-and-true margarita mix like the Master of Mixes Margarita Mix, Ready to Use, 96 oz ($14.99; amazon.com). Just add tequila (or leave them virgin) and get the party started.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ritual Zero Proof Tequila Alternative ($25; amazon.com)</p>
<p>Ritual Zero Proof Tequila Alternative</p>
<p>If you’re not feeling like getting saucy, but are craving the taste of an authentic margarita, sub traditional tequila with this zero proof alternative by Ritual. We’ve tried it and it tastes like the real thing — especially in a mixed drink — but has no alcohol. Literally, zero. As in, you don’t have to be 21 to purchase it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Norpo Taco Press ($6.95; amazon.com)</p>

CLOSE</p>
<p>Tacos are everywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>And everywhere they go, argues José R. Ralat in “American Tacos: A History and Guide” (University of Texas), they take on the flavors around them.</p>
<p>In Mexico, tacos are regional. What goes between a folded tortilla changes in every corner of the country.</p>
<p>Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine, sees the same regional variation happening in the U.S., where tacos are filled with barbecue, kimchi and even pastrami.</p>
<p>And in the South, we have Sur-Mex.</p>
<p>Ralat spoke to The American South about this delicious development in our region.</p>
<p>The American South: How do you define a taco?</p>
<p>In &ldquo;American Tacos&rdquo; (University of Texas), José R. Ralat traces the regional variation of the taco in the United States. (Photo: University of Texas Press)</p>
<p>José R. Ralat: Two ways. There&rsquo;s the physical definition. A tortilla, the most important component. Its filling, which does not have to be meat. And a salsa. But I also define a taco as representative and reflective of its time and place. It&rsquo;s regional. Its appearance, its taste, its essence depends on what the people want to eat, who those people are and what ingredients are available in the marketplace.</p>
<p>AS: Why have tacos been so enthusiastically embraced across the U.S.?</p>
<p>JRR: Mexican food as a whole makes everything better. Whatever you throw at it, it improves.</p>
<p>AS: When was Sur-Mex created?</p>
<p>JRR: The world&rsquo;s two greatest corn cultures are Mexico and the U.S. South. The fact that it took until the 1990s for it to coalesce is surprising, considering that Mexicans have traveled the South and populated the South even before it was the Americans South.</p>
<p>AS: Who created Sur-Mex?</p>
<p>JRR: Taquería del Sol, which is in Atlanta and Nashville. And then El Mero in Memphis is the greatest example of learning from Taquería del Sol and running with the idea.</p>
<p>A prime example of Sur-Mex food as described by the book &ldquo;American Tacos&rdquo; is the fried chicken taco from El Mero Taco in Memphis. (Photo: Clarissa and Jacob Dries)</p>
<p>AS: How is Sur-Mex different from the Tex Mex restaurants that have long existed in the region?</p>
<p>JRR: El Mero and Taquería del Sol, for example, both have fried chicken tacos. El Mero then goes beyond with things like albondigas, or meatballs, in chipotles mixed with collard greens. That sounds so Southern and so Mexican, but it&rsquo;s something entirely different. It is Sur-Mex. I dream about Sur-Mex, actually. Why isn&rsquo;t this more prominent? Why isn&rsquo;t this being talked about on the Food Network? This is wrong. It should be everywhere.</p>
<p>Fried chicken taco at Taqueria del Sol, which has restaurants in Georgia and Tennessee, is an example of the Sur-Mex cooking described in &ldquo;American Tacos.&rdquo; (Photo: Robert Strickland)</p>
<p>AS: Do you see Sur-Mex as something organic, driven by Mexican Americans in the South embracing the food around them? Or is it more self-conscious and driven by chefs?</p>
<p>JRR: It&rsquo;s both. You have a chef like Oscar Díaz of Jose and Sons in Raleigh, N.C., saying that he would like to make Mexican food with Southern components. Oscar said to me, “This is our food. This is what we eat here. This is just as much a part of us as it is them.”</p>
<p>AS: What is the future of Sur-Mex?</p>
<p>JRR: The South has immigrants from all over the place. I think you&rsquo;re going to see a lot of splintering or branching out. You&rsquo;ll have Sur-Mex but Sur-Mex will include Indo-Mex. It will include examples of food being adapted from other populations living next to Southerners. It’s really spurred on by the taco&rsquo;s inherent adaptability.</p>

<p>Take a bite of Sur-Mex</p>
<p>Ralat recommends these restaurants that blend the flavors of Mexico and the South. Note: Due to the coronavirus pandemic, some restaurants have limited seating or are only offering takeout.</p>

<h3 id="3-all-star-taco-recipes-from-the-finalists-of-top-chef-all-stars">&ldquo;3 all-star taco recipes from the finalists of &lsquo;Top Chef All Stars&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_25/1581160/top-chef-melissa-mc-main1-200617_ef91365ced9e8e114d6db5ef642a8862.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg" alt="img">
To celebrate the &ldquo;Top Chef All-Stars&rdquo; finale, the three finalists from this season, Stephanie Cmar, Melissa King and Bryan Voltaggio, are sharing their creative taco recipes from episode 7&rsquo;s Quickfire challenge. In the challenge, they had to impress &ldquo;Machete&rdquo; actor and Trejo’s Tacos restaurateur, Danny Trejo, by making the perfect taco in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Bravo is a part of our parent company, NBCUniversal. Created by TODAY with our sponsor Dawn.</p>
<p>Stephanie Cmar, a Boston-based private chef, is making ground lamb tacos with crunchy cashews, refreshing cucumber and a spicy, smoky crema — the recipe that won her the Quickfire challenge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love this recipe so much because it is full of different flavors and textures!&rdquo; Cmar told TODAY Food. &ldquo;Every bite is an adventure of flavor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melissa King, a San Francisco-based chef who was a &ldquo;Top Chef&rdquo; Season 12 finalist, is preparing five-spice beer-battered fish tacos with a jicama-mango slaw and guacamole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a native Southern California girl, I love tacos, especially a good battered fish taco!&rdquo; King told TODAY. &ldquo;It brings me back to my high school days driving around the beach hunting them down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would also make a 20-avocado guacamole in a giant bowl at the &lsquo;Top Chef&rdquo; house for the cast. It was such a hit with everyone, the chefs started demanding it nearly every other day! When the taco challenge came up, the other chefs weren’t surprised I busted out my guac recipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two-time runner-up Bryan Voltaggio, the Frederick, Maryland-based executive chef and co-owner of four restaurants, is making grilled miso salmon tacos with avocado and tomatillo salsa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love the umami-rich miso marinade for the salmon,&rdquo; Voltaggio told TODAY. &ldquo;It adds a lot of flavor without overpowering the fish. The avocado, salsa and the spicy radish add the right amount of texture and, when combined with the acidic punch from the salsa, make this taco a favorite of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="why-torchys-got-rid-of-the-republican-independent-tacos-and-when-theyre-coming-back">&ldquo;Why Torchy’s got rid of the Republican, Independent tacos, and when they’re coming back&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2019/09/torchys.jpg?w=1077&amp;h=606&amp;crop=1&amp;resize=1280,720" alt="img">
AUSTIN (KXAN) — The Torchy’s Tacos menu may look a little different right now — but it’s not a political statement by the popular Austin-based taco restaurant.</p>
<p>Torchy’s decided to remove several of its lowest-selling tacos to simplify the menu and match business needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Republican and Independent tacos were removed, yet the Democrat taco remains.</p>
<p>A spokesperson with the restaurant says the decision has “absolutely nothing to do with taking a political stance or making a political statement,” but is only to support the needs of its employees.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that the reduced menu makes employees’ jobs a little easier during the pandemic and allows them to “focus on the tacos our fans love most.”</p>
<p>There is good news if you’re hankering for the jalapeno sausage-focused Republican or the vegetarian-focused Independent taco. The restaurant says the Republican is returning to the menu next week and it is working on a replacement for the Independent, as well.</p>
<p>“Whatever your party or taco preference, we don’t judge. At the end of the day, it’s none of our Damn business, we just want to serve the Damn Good tacos our guests have come to love,” Torchy’s told KXAN.

<h3 id="kick-off-summer-with-tacos-and-kayaking-at-this-flat-rock-restaurant">&ldquo;Kick off summer with tacos and kayaking at this Flat Rock restaurant!&rdquo;</h3>

Flat Rock – Summer is finally here! The weather is warm and people are itching to enjoy the great outdoors. So why not head to a place where you can kayak down a river and finish the afternoon off with a feast of authentic street tacos? Yes, such a place exists and it is called Atwater Street Tacos, in Flat Rock.</p>
<p>Owning their own restaurant has always been a dream of Gerardo Melgarejo, his wife Monica, and their friend, so when they came across a building that was for lease on Atwater Street in downtown Flat Rock, they decided to jump on it. Gerardo’s whole family came together to make their dream a reality. His father took up making the meats and marinades for the restaurant, his mom contributed her expertise to the sauces and salsas, Monica took up the business end of things, while Gerardo stepped into the chef position.</p>
<p>They wanted to make authentic street food, so their tacos are done in the traditional Mexican way, with two corn tortillas, meat, and topped with onions, cilantro, and a lime wedge. They also have the popular Mexican corn street foods elotes, and esquites, among other dishes. While they did try to remain authentic as possible, they also have some menu items that were of their own creation like their fajita bowls. It was very important to the owners to use local products, so they source much of their food locally and you can see all of their providers on the bottom of your receipt. Prices run $8-11 per plate with sides coming in at around $3.</p>
<p>Currently, because of the Coronavirus pandemic, they are no longer doing dine-in service inside their building, but you can still order your meal and enjoy it on their gorgeous patio where you get beautiful views of the Huron River, and plenty of ducks. You can also see people renting kayaks and canoes and taking a trip down the river because you can rent them right next door at Atwater Paddles, which they also run.</p>
<p>Single-person kayaks and canoes run $25 for a 2.5-hour-long trip. Tandem kayaks are $35. They also have bikes available to rent as well.</p>
<p>If the patio is full, you can also opt for a picnic at Huron Park, which is just a short walk away and hosts many picnic tables. So, make an afternoon of it and get some tacos and then take a peaceful trip down the river!</p>
<p>Atwater Street Tacos is located at 26425 Atwater Street in Flat Rock. They currently offer take-out and delivery through Grubhub.
