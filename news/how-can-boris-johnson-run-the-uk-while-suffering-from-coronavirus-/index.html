London (CNN) When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Friday morning that he had tested positive for coronavirus, he insisted that he would continue to head up his country&rsquo;s fight against the pandemic.</p>
<p>In a video posted to his official Twitter page, Johnson said that &ldquo;thanks to the wizardry of modern technology,&rdquo; he would continue to lead the effort remotely from the prime ministerial quarters above 11 Downing Street, next door to one of the most famous addresses on earth.</p>
<p>But how can the leader of a country with a population of over 66 million carry on as normal while self-isolating during a global health crisis? Especially as his health secretary also tested positive for the virus, and that his chief medical officer self-isolated with symptoms.</p>
<p>Isolating the Prime Minister is not that difficult, in itself. The Downing Street premises are actually considerably bigger than they look from the outside. Behind that famous black door at Number 10 lies a warren of rooms and offices that extend sideways into 11 and 12 Downing Street &ndash; the three addresses are all that survive from a longer terrace constructed at the end of the 17th century &ndash; and back into a much larger 18th-century building at the rear.</p>
<p>Johnson lives in a rather modest apartment above Number 11, which is easily shut off from Number 10. (A Downing Street spokesman said earlier on Friday that the connecting door between the two buildings would be shut.) Anything that the Prime Minister needs, whether official papers or deliveries of food and drink, will be left outside a door for him to collect. However, in an effort to contain the virus, Downing Street will try to keep even this level of contact at a minimum.</p>

<h3 id="uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus">U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Tests Positive for Coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Boris-Johnson-coronavirus.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=1024&amp;h=628&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the coronavirus. Johnson said he has developed a temperature and a persistent cough over the past 24 hours in a video on his twitter account.</p>
<p>On the advice of England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, Johnson was tested for the coronavirus. A statement from Downing Street said that the test was carried out at No 10 by NHS staff.</p>
<p>“I am working from home, I am self-isolating and that is entirely the right thing to do,” Johnson said in a video posted to Twitter on Friday morning. The prime minister added that he will continue to lead “the national fightback against coronavirus” from his home in Downing Street.</p>
<p>According to the U.K. government, as of 9am on 27 March 2020, a total of 113,777 people have been tested, of which 14,579 were confirmed positive. As of 5pm on 26 March 2020, 759 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) had died.</p>
<p>the U.K. had 11,658 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 578 deaths as of Thursday March 26. There have been 3,919 cases in London alone. Matt Hancock, the U.K.’s Secretary of State for Health &amp; Social Care, also announced Friday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus after displaying mild symptoms. Hancock said he is working from home and will be self-isolating until April 2.</p>

<p>During a press conference at the beginning of March, Johnson said that he was “shaking hands with everyone continuously.” He added that had visited a hospital where “there were a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, it was announced that Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, had tested positive for the coronavirus after showing mild symptoms. His office said that he was self-isolating at a royal estate in Scotland.</p>
<p>Johnson is among several high-profile politicians who have tested positive for the coronavirus amid the pandemic. Johnson had interacted with Nadine Dorries, a U.K. health minister, who tested positive for the virus on March 10. Senior politicians in France, Spain, Italy and Iran have also all contracted the virus.</p>
<p>On March 12, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would self-isolate for two weeks after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau announced that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine after being informed that a doctor who administered a vaccine to her tested positive for the coronavirus; Merkel later tested negative for the coronavirus and her staff said she would receive further repeat tests.</p>
