<p>The footage shows things escalating very quickly, resulting in the 27-year-old&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>ATLANTA — Atlanta Police have released bodycam and dashcam video showing the moments leading to the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks in a Wendy&rsquo;s parking lot.</p>
<p>The shooting happened late Friday night at the fast food restaurant on University Avenue.</p>
<p>Police were called to the scene around 10:30 p.m. after complaints of a man asleep at the wheel near the Wendy&rsquo;s drive-thru line.</p>
<p>The man, later identified as Brooks, failed a field sobriety test, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. When officers tried to take him into custody, a struggled ensued. During the altercation, officials said Brooks grabbed an officer&rsquo;s Taser and began to run away. Moments later, shots were fired.</p>
<p>Brooks was taken to the hospital, where he later died.</p>
<p>One officer involved in the incident, Devin Brosnan, has been placed on administrative duty. Another, Officer Garrett Rolfe, has been terminated.</p>
<p>Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields announced her resignation on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the GBI released footage from the Wendy&rsquo;s surveillance camera showing the shooting.</p>
<p>Just after midnight Sunday, Atlanta police released footage from the officer&rsquo;s body and vehicle cameras.</p>
<p>11Alive is continuing to watch the videos. Below is a summary of parts of what we&rsquo;ve seen. Check back for more updates as we continue to review the footage.</p>
<p>Officer Brosnan body cam footage</p>
<p>Brosnan&rsquo;s bodycam footage shows him first encounter Brooks, who appears to be sleeping, in his car in the drive-thru.</p>
<p>Brooks pulls his car into the parking lot and engages in conversation with Brosnan and Rolfe.</p>
<p>Brooks tells the officers that a friend dropped him off at the Wendy&rsquo;s. He tells the officer that he wanted to get food from the restaurant and go back to his hotel.</p>
<p>The officer has Brooks perform a field sobriety test.</p>
<p>Brooks admits to the officer that he drank &ldquo;one and a half margaritas.&rdquo; He submits to a preliminary breathalyzer test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to refuse anything,&rdquo; Brooks says.</p>
<p>After taking the test, Rolfe tells Brooks, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve had too much to drink to be driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the officers place cuffs on Brooks&rsquo; hands, which are behind his back, Brooks appears to begin to struggle with them.</p>
<p>At that point, the body cam begins to shake.</p>
<p>The officers are heard telling Brooks, &ldquo;Stop fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna get Tased,&rdquo; one officer says.</p>
<p>Seconds later, an officer shouts, &ldquo;Hands off the Taser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body cam appears to fall on the ground.</p>
<p>One officer yells, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got my [expletive] Taser!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Footage shows one officer appear to take out a Taser as the camera points up into the dark sky.</p>
<p>What sounds like three gunshots are heard. The actual shooting is not on that bodycam.</p>
<p>A commotion is heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s totally unnecessary,&rdquo; a bystander is heard saying, while another says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s messed up man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>WARNING: Video contains disturbing scenes and adult language.</p>
<p>Officer Rolfe bodycam video</p>
<p>Rolfe&rsquo;s body camera offers a view that&rsquo;s similar to Brosnan&rsquo;s video. The camera is also knocked down in the struggle, and the shooting itself is not seen.</p>
<p>This is a portion of that video:</p>
<p>Rolfe&rsquo;s full video is a one hour and 28 minutes, and ends with him back at what appears to be police headquarters.</p>
<p>Officer Rolfe dashcam video</p>
<p>Dashcam video from Rolfe&rsquo;s patrol car shows a clearer view of the struggle between the officers and Brooks:</p>
<p>Wendy&rsquo;s surveillance video footage of Rayshard Brooks shooting:</p>
<p>Wendy&rsquo;s burns down after night of protests</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after the shooting, Wendy&rsquo;s where the incident occurred was engulfed in flames after a day of protests in the area.</p>

WSB</p>
<p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) provided an update on the fatal police-involved shooting of a black man at an Atlanta fast food drive-thru last night.</p>
<p>According to GBI Director Vic Reynolds, at around 10:33 p.m. ET on Friday night, Atlanta Police requested the assistance of the GBI in an officer-involved shooting at a Wendy&rsquo;s restaurant on University Ave in Southeast Atlanta. The incident involved two Atlanta Police officers and Rayshard Brooks.</p>
<p>The GBI has continuously worked on the investigation since being called into the matter Friday night and has spoken with several witnesses and viewed different surveillance videos including Wendy&rsquo;s surveillance footage and video taken by witnesses posted to social media, Reynolds said in a news conference Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>The statement made early Saturday morning by the GBI was released after officials reviewed body cam footage provided by the APD.</p>
<p>What happened, according to the GBI: Reynolds said it appears that Brooks was under investigation by the APD for a suspected DUI offense, and that sometime during the course of the investigation, he became engaged with two Atlanta officers and that engagement turned into a physical confrontation, as seen on video.</p>
<p>During the course of that confrontation, Brooks was able to secure the Taser from one of the Atlanta police officers, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Based on surveillance footage from Wendy&rsquo;s, GBI says it appears that Brooks ran off with one of the officers&rsquo; Tasers and made it only short distance away, the length of what is described as 5-7 parking spaces, and then turns around, and points the Taser at the Atlanta officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that point the Atlanta officer reaches down and retrieves his weapon from his holster, discharges it, strikes Mr. Brooks there on the parking lot and he goes down,&rdquo; Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Moving forward: Reynolds said he instructed agents to expedite the investigation, saying he wants to be &ldquo;very, very quick&rdquo; but still &ldquo;very thorough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to do it the right way. I&rsquo;m sure when I speak to the public that anybody who had a loved one in this situation on either side, either as a law enforcement officer or as someone who has been involved in a situation where officers used deadly force that they want the investigation done correctly. They want it done thoroughly, and they want it done right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The GBI says it will make surveillance video of the incident available to the media Saturday evening with a digital enhance of what the GBI focused on in the investigation into the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In circumstances like this, when an officer is involved in the use of deadly force, people have a right to know how it happened. Where it happened. The circumstances surrounding the situation,&rdquo; Reynolds said.</p>

<h3 id="tamla-horsford-family-attorney-slams-gbi-over-handling-of-her-case---weighs-in-on-rayshard-brooks-death">&ldquo;Tamla Horsford family attorney slams GBI over handling of her case - weighs in on Rayshard Brooks death&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/470001fa-6d0e-4376-94c9-52846b3cbf8f/470001fa-6d0e-4376-94c9-52846b3cbf8f_1140x641.jpg" alt="img">
The Horsford family attorney accused the state agency of being &lsquo;compromised&rsquo; as it reopens her death investigation.</p>
<p>CUMMING, Ga. — The attorney who represents the family of Tamla Horsford slammed Georgia&rsquo;s top investigative agency on Saturday, just days after they reopened the inquiry into her death.</p>
<p>Attorney Fernandez didn&rsquo;t mince words when giving his opinion regarding the agency which is now charged with investigating the death of a mother of five in Forsyth County years earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people of Georgia should know that the GBI, Georgia Bureau of Investigations, is compromised,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The obstruction their top ranks engaged in, their disregard for the law and their tactics attempting now to diminish the impact of their conduct in the cover-up of the Horsford homicide investigation, does not bode well in today&rsquo;s tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forty-year-old Horsford was attending an overnight house party for adults in November 2018 when she died. Her death was ruled an accident but the story became the center of controversy online.</p>
<p>Still, the case was closed in February 2019 after the Forsyth County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said it spent 300 hours investigating the case. That included 30 interviews.</p>
<p>The reopening of the case came at the request of Forsyth County Sheriff Ron Freeman who asked the GBI to independently look at Horsford&rsquo;s death. That move followed another message from the family&rsquo;s attorney said that his office found that &ldquo;homicide is a strong possibility after they conducted an exhaustive review of the case. Fernandez also suggested local law enforcement was involved in a cover-up.</p>
<p>According to reporting, Horsford was found fully clothed in the backyard of a home on Woodlet Court on the morning of Nov. 4, 2018. In 911 audio obtained by 11Alive, a woman and her boyfriend described Horsford as &ldquo;stiff&rdquo; and &ldquo;face down&rdquo; near the deck in the backyard. Over the course of the eight-minute-long phone call, they indicate that the deck is about 20 feet off of the ground.</p>
<p>The report showed that she did have high levels of alcohol and traces of anti-anxiety drug Xanax and marijuana in her system.</p>
<p>Investigators said no one at the party witnessed Horsford&rsquo;s fall from the deck and that the 911 calls were made right after she was found the next morning.</p>
<p>But while the reopening of the case may mean new answers for the family, their attorney&rsquo;s words for the GBI suggest he expects the agency won&rsquo;t diverge from the findings of the sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Rayshard Brooks&rsquo; death in Atlanta, which the GBI is also investigating, attorney Fernandez had words of comfort - and concern - for the Brooks family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rayshard Brooks and his family deserve better. My regards to them and the fine legal team that now has to confront this challenge,&rdquo; he said.
