Star jockey Mark Zahra has been cleared of COVID-19 – clearing racing to return to Victoria.</p>
<p>It ends a nervous wait for the hoop and the industry after he was informed on Wednesday that he may have had contact with a Coronavirus case when he caught a commercial flight to Victoria on March 12.</p>
<p>Zahra, as well as other star jockeys Hugh Bowman and Tommy Berry, were tested as a precaution and racing was halted across Victoria and NSW. The duo were also cleared on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Zahra&rsquo;s negative test for COVID-19 paves the way for racing to resume at Warrnambool&rsquo;s meeting on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Friday twilight meeting at Pakenham will also go ahead as planned, as will Flemington&rsquo;s jump outs on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Racing Victoria had planned to wait until the last possible second on Friday before postponing the Warrnambool and Pakenham meetings. Thankfully, Zahra&rsquo;s results came late on Friday night.</p>
<p>Zahra is not booked for any rides until the Golden Mile meeting at Bendigo on Saturday.</p>
<p>Racing Victoria chief executive Giles Thompson said the &ldquo;situation has placed undue pressure on Mark through no fault of his own&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to again publicly thank and acknowledge the professional and responsible manner in which he has acted,&rdquo; Thompson said.</p>
<p>“Mark’s negative test paves the way for racing to resume in Victoria tomorrow and for this we are extremely grateful. We are acutely aware of the incredible hardship that many Australians are facing as at this time through the loss of their jobs, which is why we are continuing to work so hard to protect the livelihoods of all those within Victorian racing who depend on it.</p>
<p>“Victorian racing supports the equivalent of 25,000 full-time jobs through the employment of a vast array of people including trainers, stable staff, jockeys, breeders, vets, farriers, float drivers, administrators, officials and many more. At the centre of our sport is the horse and these people provide the critical care and attention that our horses require on a daily basis.</p>
<p>“In announcing the resumption of racing, I want to assure the Victorian community that racing will continue to operate under strict biosecurity protocols and where required act decisively, as we did when suspending racing yesterday, should there be any risk to the health of our industry stakeholders and the wider community.”

<h3 id="relieved-mark-zahra-reveals-all-about-coronavirus-wait">Relieved Mark Zahra reveals all about coronavirus wait</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.racenet.com.au/images/icons/favicon-new.ico?v=1.0.415.0" alt="img">
Mark Zahra has spoken about his relief in receiving a negative coronavirus test result but says he was relaxed as he could be while waiting for the result which could have had massive ramifications for the Aussie racing industry.</p>
<p>Zahra told The Herald Sun newspaper he was confident that as he was fit and healthy he would return a negative to the test and revealed he spent Thursday with his feet up and playing Xbox with his wife, Elyse, with a glass of red wine as he waited for the test results.</p>
<p>However he worried about the ramifications for the industry if he tested positive - it was a weight off his mind when the test results came back and racing was cleared to resume.</p>
<p>“I don’t get too stressed but I was relieved when I got the news I was all clear. To be honest we spend most of our lives being flat out it was nice to have a day where you could sit back and relax,&rdquo; Zahra told The Herald Sun.</p>
<p>Zahra said he was first advised of the situation that he had sat near someone on a flight back from Sydney who had tested positive to COVID-19 on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Incredibly, a last-minute decision to change flights could have changed the course of Australian racing history.</p>
<p>“I was flying back on the 1pm flight and that got delayed to 3pm. I spotted a flight going at midday so I got on that quickly. I wish I didn’t do that,” Zahra said, as he revealed he was in the back emergency row and didn’t sit next to anyone.</p>
<p>“The health authorities contacted Dr Gary Zimmerman and he quickly alerted me. I rang my wife, my mum and dad, my two brothers and sister quickly while Gary alerted the racing fraternity.</p>
<p>“I can tell you the testing procedure was uncomfortable. They stuck tubes all over the place. I don’t want to do that again.”</p>
<p>The new shape of Aussie racing with its strict coronavirus protocols means Zahra won’t be able to return to Sydney to ride and that has cost him rides on Super Seth in the Doncaster Mile and Santa Ana Lane in the TJ Smith Stakes.</p>
<p>Zahra has five rides at Bendigo on Saturday including Sikandarabad in the $150,000 Bendigo Golden Mile.
