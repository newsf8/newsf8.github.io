KIND hearted mum Angelina Jolie today took her kids to a movie in LA after revealing her two daughters had recently undergone surgeries.

The 44-year-old actress explained that Zahara, 15, has been "in and out of surgery" in the last two months, while her younger sister had a hip operation.

Angelina Jolie was spotted out with her kids after revealing two of her daughter's had had surgery

The Maleficent star - who is mum to Maddox, 18, Pax, 16, Zahara, Shiloh, 13, and 11-year-old Vivienne and Knox - didn't specify who was the second child to have had surgery.

But today she put any pain aside to enjoy some time with her kids.

Although it hasn't been confirmed who the other chid is to have surgery Shiloh was seen on crutches.

The family looked happy and relaxed as they enjoyed some quality time together.

Th family were all heading to a movie

Shilo was on crutches although it's not been confirmed if she had surgery

It was revealed Zahara had had surgery

Angelina revealed yesterday about her brave daughters.

The star shared the news in an essay for Time on International Women's Day.

"I have spent the last two months in and out of surgeries with my eldest daughter, and days ago watched her younger sister go under the knife for a hip surgery," the Oscar winner wrote.

"They know that I am writing this, because I respect their privacy and we discussed it together and they encouraged me to write. They understand that going through medical challenges and fighting to survive and heal is something to be proud of."

Angelina held onto Shiloh's crutches

The actress, who's starring in the upcoming film Those Who Wish Me Dead, said her daughters rallied together to "care for one another" and "faced their fears with resolute bravery".

"My youngest daughter studied the nurses with her sister, and then assisted the next time," Angelina said.

"I saw how all my girls so easily stopped everything and put each other first and felt the joy of being of service to those they love. I also watched them...face fears with a resolute bravery.

"We all know that moment when no one else can help us, and all we can do is close our eyes and breathe. When only we can take the next step or breath through the pain, so we steady ourselves and do it."

Angelina spoke about her brave daughters

Angelina failed to mention her kids' father, ex-husband Brad Pitt, who was spotted with a mystery woman in Los Angeles on Saturday night.

The Once Upon A Time In Hollywood actor was seen watching Thundercat with a young female companion with a buzzcut, although there appeared to be nothing romantic about their outing.

Jolie did, however, say that the girls' brothers were "there for them" and were "supportive and sweet".

The Mr And Mrs Smith actress has had her own operations in the past, including a double mastectomy and having her ovaries removed to help ward off cancer.

Angelina and Brad filed for divorce in September 2016 following an incident on a plane when Brad allegedly lost control of himself and clashed with son Maddox, 16.

The Hollywood couple then released a joint statement where they said they'd agreed to settle their divorce in private.
