<p>I am proud to announce that Joanne and I have become proud grandparents again.</p>
<p>Our daughter Emily and her husband Pete welcomed their fourth son to the family. Being traditional in their beliefs, they decided not to find out the sex of the baby before he was born. While I do not know for sure, I do believe that they had a girl’s name ready to go if the baby was going to be a girl.</p>
<p>From our own experience, having three girls then two boys, we had a boy’s name ready to go for each of the girls. It was going to be the same name and our oldest son Ted finally carries that name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what we would have done for a name if Ted would have been a girl instead of a boy. As I think back on it, we struggled naming our third daughter before taking her home. Jenni would probably agree that we finally got the right name for the right person.</p>
<p>With Emily and Pete&rsquo;s fourth child there was a lot of interest in our family surrounding this baby. My wife put together a pool to guess the date, time, sex, weight, length and name. Everyone participated in the pool, but Emily and Pete did not submit guesses for names. My wife made up for that by submitting not one but 14 options.</p>
<p>Once we were informed of the baby’s healthy birth, Emily and Pete were quiet about the sex and name. This led to much speculation among the remaining family members. The text messages between the family lit up with guesses and name suggestions.</p>
<p>When we finally learned the baby was a boy, the name suggestions continued, along with origins of the names, rationale and general prodding for each submitted name. One clever suggestion was that the boy be named “Sioux.&rdquo; A reference to an old Johnny Cash song and to Joanne’s hometown of Sioux City. That name was quickly rejected.</p>
<p>Emily and Pete continued their name deliberations in relative quiet from the rest of us. Each specific inquiry was responded with politeness and a lack of a specific answer. Every now and then they would say that they were getting closer.</p>
<p>As small business owners and managers, if we were fortunate enough to start our own companies, we had to choose a name for our business. It had to be memorable, but not too cutesy. It had to be reflective of what we did, but not too boring. It had to fit our personality, but it had to be recognizable.</p>
<p>As I think about it, picking out the right name for our business is a lot like trying to pick out a name for a child. Pick the wrong name for a child, and they might get picked on, or worse yet, shunned by the other kids in school. Pick the wrong name for a business and it might not ever get off the ground.</p>
<p>The good news about picking a name for your business is that you can have one name for a corporation, and then choose to have a “doing business as” or d/b/a, and have another name. That way you might get the best of both worlds, and many of my clients have gone that route. I suggest you visit your attorney for more information.</p>
<p>In the end, Emily and Pete named their newest little bundle of joy Leo Michael. According to Google: “Leo is a strong yet friendly name that was common among the Romans and used for thirteen popes.” Leo is not a Leo, according to astrology. Leo is actually a Pisces, and with great parents and family support, he will be a success in life.</p>

<h3 id="triscuit-confirms-that-its-name-does-stand-for-electricity-biscuit">Triscuit confirms that its name <em>does</em> stand for &lsquo;electricity biscuit&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://mondrian.mashable.com/2020%252F03%252F26%252F70%252F5b0f7c503f08442ab8b5adaf37099350.6b67e.jpg%252F1200x630.jpg?signature=vMTMrM5HfyZxVzUftOMZ3yTY3_U=" alt="img">
Triscuit&rsquo;s name has nothing to do with the number of layers the cracker has — it&rsquo;s actually a portmanteau of two completely unexpected words.</p>
<p>According to the company, its name actually stems from &ldquo;electricity biscuit.&rdquo; The snack&rsquo;s real name was revealed in response to a Twitter thread from writer Sage Boggs.</p>
<p>Several years ago I was at a party (BRAG!), and I spotted a box of Triscuits. I asked everyone, &ldquo;What does the word &lsquo;Triscuit&rsquo; mean? It&rsquo;s clearly based on the word &ldquo;BISCUIT,&rdquo; but what does the &ldquo;TRI&rdquo; mean?&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m great at parties.) — Sage Boggs (@sageboggs) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>Boggs emailed the parent company, Nabisco, after try to guess where the name &ldquo;Triscuit&rdquo; stemmed from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No business records survived which specifically explain the origins of inspiration for the word Triscuit,&rdquo; the company told Boggs in an email. &ldquo;But we do know the name was chosen as a fun derivation of the word &lsquo;biscuit.&rsquo; The &lsquo;TRI&rsquo; does not mean 3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boggs, &ldquo;baffled&rdquo; and still curious, did some digging and unearthed Triscuit&rsquo;s original advertisements.</p>
<p>I was baffled. And I couldn&rsquo;t stand not knowing. So I did a little sleuthing online, and stumbled on some early Triscuit advertisements. Take a look at these bad boys: pic.twitter.com/jbeBUmjeCF — Sage Boggs (@sageboggs) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>Triscuit&rsquo;s early selling point, Boggs said, was that it was &ldquo;baked by electricity&rdquo; — the company was run out of Niagara Falls and powered the production process from the then-novel invention.</p>
<p>Elec-TRI-city Biscuit</p>
<p>TRISCUIT MEANS &ldquo;ELECTRICITY BISCUIT&rdquo; — Sage Boggs (@sageboggs) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>Which means, Boggs realized, that &ldquo;Triscuit&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;elec-TRI-city bi-SCUIT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mind blowing.</p>
<p>Triscuit confirmed the realization in a quote tweet on Thursday.</p>
<p>We had to go all the way up the ladder but we CAN confirm ⚡️ https://t.co/yFWWL3MjX3 — Triscuit⚡️ (@TheRealTriscuit) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>And blessed us all with this good meme.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s your daily fun fact to keep you entertained while social distancing.

<p>As part of NASA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Send Your Name to Mars&rsquo; campaign, they&rsquo;ve been stenciled onto three microchips along with essays from NASA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Name the Rover&rsquo; contest. Next stop: Mars.</p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Send Your Name to Mars&rdquo; campaign invited people around the world to submit their names to ride aboard the agency&rsquo;s next rover to the Red Planet. Some 10,932,295 people did just that. The names were stenciled by electron beam onto three fingernail-sized silicon chips, along with the essays of the 155 finalists in NASA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Name the Rover&rdquo; contest. The chips were then were attached to an aluminum plate on NASA&rsquo;s Perseverance Mars rover at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on March 16. Scheduled to launch this summer, Perseverance will land at Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.</p>
<p>The three chips share space on the anodized plate with a laser-etched graphic depicting Earth and Mars joined by the star that gives light to both. While commemorating the rover that connects the two worlds, the simple illustration also pays tribute to the elegant line art of the plaques aboard the Pioneer spacecraft and golden records carried by Voyagers 1 and 2. Affixed to the center of the rover&rsquo;s aft crossbeam, the plate will be visible to cameras on Perseverance&rsquo;s mast.</p>

<p>Currently, the coronavirus has not impacted the Mars Perseverance rover launch schedule. The installation was one of numerous recent activities performed by the Perseverance assembly, test and launch operations team. On March 21, the team began reconfiguring the rover so it can ride atop the Atlas V rocket. Steps included stowing the robotic arm, lowering and locking in place the remote sensing mast and high-gain antenna, and retracting its legs and wheels.</p>
<p>The Perseverance rover is a robotic scientist weighing just under 2,300 pounds (1,043 kilograms). It will search for signs of past microbial life, characterize Mars&rsquo; climate and geology, collect samples for future return to Earth, and help pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet.</p>
<p>JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, is building and will manage operations of the Mars Perseverance rover for NASA. The agency&rsquo;s Launch Services Program, based at the agency&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, is responsible for launch management. The Mars 2020 project with its Perseverance rover is part of a larger program that includes missions to the Moon as a way to prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. Charged with returning astronauts to the Moon by 2024, NASA will establish a sustained human presence on and around the Moon by 2028 through NASA&rsquo;s Artemis lunar exploration plans.</p>
