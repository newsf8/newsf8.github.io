Today’s Google Doodle celebrating Banh Mi, the traditional Vietnamese street vendor sandwich, is sure to get your mouth watering.</p>
<p>No one knows for sure how the banh mi, traditionally spelled bánh mì, was created other than taking its inspiration from French cuisine, specifically their sandwiches made on baguettes. Except the bread, all of the other ingredients of a banh mi are traditional Vietnamese ingredients and flavors like pork pâté and pickled radishes. Like every other sandwich known to man, the banh mi can be made in a variety of different ways, with each restaurant or street vendor putting their own spin on it with different meats, veggies, spices and sauces.</p>
<p>As for why Google has selected today to honor the sandwich, we can thank the Oxford Dictionary for that. On this day in 2011, following its acceptance into our culture and our stomachs, “bánh mì” was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
<p>In the doodle itself, artist Olivia Huynh depicts a spread of ingredients heavily inspired by the street vendors who spend their days handcrafting the banh mi for the hungry hordes at lunchtime.</p>
<p>Many people helped make this Doodle and contributed to the idea, especially our local market experts. Much of the inspiration came from food cart vendors, how fast they can put everything together, and how good every ingredient is individually.</p>
<p>I hope the Doodle will bring some gratitude to street food vendors and chefs who make them daily, and that many more people will enjoy one. The entire time I worked on this Doodle I was hungry and craving bánh mì. Even though I ate several over the course of working on this, and every time I did, I felt like I found a new appreciation.</p>
<p>To help craft the artwork for the doodle, Huynh teamed up with a 3D artist to render a street food vendor’s cart and the ingredients used to make the sandwich. Google shared some of these 3D examples and much more as concept art on the official Doodle blog.</p>
<p>The doodle and the sandwich it celebrates holds a special place in this author’s heart as a banh mi sandwich was my introduction to sriracha sauce. In fact, if you’ve not yet had the privilege to try a banh mi, I personally recommend you consider having one delivered for lunch.</p>

<h3 id="fleur-de-lolly-column-bánh-mì-sandwich-in-a-burger-form">Fleur de Lolly column: Bánh mì sandwich in a burger form</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.stjamesnews.com/storyimage/MN/20200324/NEWS/200329893/AR/0/AR-200329893.jpg" alt="img">
Bánh mì is a Vietnamese term for all kinds of bread. The word is derived from banh (bread) and mi (wheat, also spelled mì in northern Vietnam). Bread, or more specifically, the baguette, was introduced by the French during its colonial period there. It is sometimes compared with a food item known as a “Vietnamese sandwich.”</p>
<p>The toppings include pickled carrots and/or radishes, sliced cucumbers, jalapeños, cilantro, and thinly sliced ham. I cut a few corners and used prepacked julienned carrots and added some grated garlic. These burgers were full of flavor, and the contrasting textures of the toppings were amazing. You can use sliced French baguettes, hamburger buns or French-style hamburger buns.</p>
<p>Instead of a traditional bánh mì sandwich, this recipe uses many of the same ingredients, but in burger form. When you’re searching for a new burger to serve to family and friends, try this one. I believe it will be a hit.</p>
<p>Bánh Mì Burger</p>
<p>First, you will need to quick pickle your carrots and radishes:</p>
<p>• 1 1/2 cups of 1/8-inch thick matchstick cut carrots</p>
<p>• 4 medium radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced</p>
<p>• 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</p>
<p>• 1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>• 2 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p>• 1/4 cup white vinegar</p>
<p>• 1/4 cup warm water</p>
<p>Put the carrots and radishes in a medium bowl and sprinkle with sugar and salt. Using your hands, toss the vegetables in the salt and sugar to begin expelling the water from them. Let the vegetables rest for about 3 minutes. They will soften, and you will see liquid starting to pool in the bottom of the bowl. The vegetables are ready when they can bend easily without snapping in half, and they have lost about a third of their volume. Drain in a colander and rinse under cool water. Gently press down on the vegetables to express any additional water.</p>
<p>In the same bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the sugar, the vinegar and 1/4 cup of warm water, and stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the vegetables to the pickling liquid. The liquid should be covering the vegetables. Let sit for about 20 minutes while you prepare the burgers.</p>
<p>Burger ingredients:</p>
<p>• 1 pound ground pork</p>
<p>• 1 1/2 tablespoons chili garlic sauce</p>
<p>• 1/2 tablespoon fish sauce</p>
<p>• 1/2 tablespoon fresh lime juice</p>
<p>• 1 large clove garlic, minced</p>
<p>• 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</p>
<p>Combine the pork, chili garlic sauce, fish sauce, lime juice, garlic and sugar. Shape into four 4-inch-wide, 1/2 inch-thick patties and let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Prepare a gas or charcoal grill or a grill pan at medium-high heat. Brush and oil the grates.</p>
<p>Place the burgers on the grill. Grill the first side about 4 minutes until grill marks form. Flip and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer reads 155 to 160 degrees F.</p>
<p>Remove the burgers from the grill and let rest on a plate. Loosely cover with foil. Place the buns on the grill and toast until grill marks form, about 1 minute.</p>
<p>Now to assemble the burgers, lightly spread mayonnaise on each side of the bun. Place one of the patties on the bottom bun. Layer the toppings in the following order: pickled carrots and radishes, thinly sliced English cucumbers, thinly sliced jalapeños, thinly sliced ham and cilantro.</p>
