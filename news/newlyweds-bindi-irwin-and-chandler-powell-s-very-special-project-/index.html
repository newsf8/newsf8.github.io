Newlyweds Bindi Irwin, 21, and Chandler Powell, 23, are working on a &lsquo;very special project&rsquo; following their nuptials this week.</p>
<p>Australia Zoo told Daily Mail Australia on Friday that the newlyweds are busy putting together something that will &lsquo;ensure their wedding is shared with everyone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>While additional details are yet to be revealed, a spokesperson for Australia Zoo encouraged fans to &lsquo;keep an eye&rsquo; on their social media channels for updates.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled!&rsquo; Australia Zoo wished newlyweds Bindi Irwin, 21, and Chandler Powell, 23, (both pictured), a &lsquo;long and happy future together&rsquo; in a statement to Daily Mail Australia on Friday</p>
<p>Australia Zoo said they were &lsquo;thrilled for Bindi and Chandler&rsquo; and &lsquo;wish them a long and happy future together as husband and wife&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Bindi and Chandler made the &lsquo;difficult decision&rsquo; to host their wedding without guests amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The decision came just hours after Prime Minister Scott Morrison enforced new restrictions on weddings, with only five people allowed to attend - including the couple, the celebrant and witnesses.</p>
<p>In the works: The couple are said to be working on a &lsquo;very special project&rsquo; to ensure fans get to witness their special day. Pictured at their wedding at Australia Zoo on Wednesday night</p>
<p>Bindi shared the first photo of the couple as husband and wife to Instagram on Wednesday night, and told fans that it was &lsquo;important to keep everyone safe&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;March 25th 2020. We held a small ceremony and I married my best friend. There are no words to describe the amount of love and light in my heart right now,&rsquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve planned this beautiful day for nearly a year and had to change everything, as we didn&rsquo;t have guests at our wedding. This was a very difficult decision but important to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>Rules: Bindi and Chandler made the &lsquo;difficult decision&rsquo; to host their wedding without guests. Hours before the nuptials, Prime Minister Scott Morrison enforced new rules on weddings, with only a maximum of five to attend, including couple. Pictured: event planners setting up</p>
<p>Crisis: Strict measures have been enforced due to coronavirus (COVID-19). As of March 27, the total number of people diagnosed with the virus in Australia is 3,050 including 13 deaths</p>
<p>&lsquo;We wish all of our friends and family could have been there with us, however it&rsquo;s lovely that we will be able to share photos and videos.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right now we&rsquo;re encouraging the world to hold onto hope and love, which will carry us forward during this profound time in history.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the stunning photo, taken in the grounds of Australia Zoo, Bindi wore a princess-style gown with a lace bodice and semi-sheer sleeves.</p>
<p>Love story: Bindi and Chandler got engaged at Australia Zoo in Queensland in July last year, on what was her 21st birthday and they began dating in 2015. Pictured in April, 2018</p>
<p>A TIMELINE OF THEIR ROMANCE NOVEMBER 2013: The pair first meet at Australia Zoo in Queensland. Chandler later asks Bindi&rsquo;s mother, Terri, if he can keep in touch with her JULY 2015: Bindi announces on Instagram that Chandler has become a &lsquo;Wildlife Warrior&rsquo; as they embark on a long-distance romance SEPTEMBER 2015: Bindi and Chandler debut their relationship on the red carpet after her appearance on Dancing with the Stars LATE 2018: Chandler moves to Queensland to live with the Irwins NOVEMBER 2018: Bindi says she feels &lsquo;lucky&rsquo; to have found &lsquo;The One&rsquo; DECEMBER 2018: The couple dismiss engagement rumours, saying they are in no rush to marry JULY 24, 2019: The pair announce their engagement on Bindi&rsquo;s 21st birthday</p>
<p>Bindi styled her brunette locks in soft waves, and added an intricate beaded crown.</p>
<p>Chandler cut a suave figure in a blue dress shirt, beige trousers and dress shoes.</p>
<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness accompanied by fever, coughing, sore throat, shortness of breath and fatigue. It can produce pneumonia.</p>
<p>As of March 27, the total number of people diagnosed with the virus in Australia is 3,050 including 13 deaths.</p>
<p>Bindi and Chandler got engaged at Australia Zoo in Queensland in July last year, on what was her 21st birthday and they began dating in 2015.</p>
<p>Family: Despite celebrating a birthday and engagement on the same day, Bindi admitted last year that it was &lsquo;bittersweet&rsquo; as her father Steve Irwin (right) was not there. Pictured also with mother Terri Irwin and brother Robert</p>
<p>Despite it being her birthday and engagement, Bindi admitted in an Instagram post at the time that it was a &lsquo;bittersweet&rsquo; day as she was celebrating without her father.</p>
<p>Steve Irwin, famously known as the &lsquo;Crocodile Hunter&rsquo;, tragically died from a stingray barb to the heart in 2006. He was 44-years-old.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Sunshine Coast Daily, she explained: &lsquo;I do really wish that dad was here to be able to celebrate with us as a family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think in some ways he is and his spirit lives on in everything that we do, and I always feel closest to dad here at Australia Zoo.&rsquo;

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200325112230-01-bindi-irwin-chandler-powell-2019-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Bindi Irwin, the 21-year-old daughter of the late conservationist and television personality Steve Irwin, has married her partner in a secret candlelit ceremony in front of close family.</p>
<p>Irwin, who followed in her father&rsquo;s footsteps to become a passionate conservationist, shared the news of her marriage to her 23-year-old partner, Chandler Powell, in an Instagram post on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The couple married in the gardens of Australia Zoo in Queensland, which was opened by her grandparents in the 1970s and is still run by the Irwin family.</p>
<p>Because the Irwin family live at the zoo together, Irwin&rsquo;s mother, Terri, and her brother, Robert, were able to attend despite the coronavirus lockdown, she wrote in the post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We held a small ceremony and I married my best friend. There are no words to describe the amount of love and light in my heart right now. We&rsquo;ve planned this beautiful day for nearly a year and had to change everything, as we didn&rsquo;t have guests at our wedding,&rdquo; she said.</p>
