<p>Supermodel Naomi Campbell has taken to social media in her hazmat suit once again.</p>
<p>The high fashion covergirl, 50, has been very active on social media throughout the coronavirus pandemic but is showing off what lengths she is going to to stay safe.</p>
<p>Taking to her Instagram account, Naomi took a selfie while wearing Waymarket hazmat suit, face mask and plastic goggles.</p>
<p>In her gloved hands the model can be seen holding a pack of disinfectant wipes with the promise to &lsquo;kill 99.9% of viruses and bachteria&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Naomi also managed to type across the label her own personal brand name &lsquo;Naomix&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The gorgeous model captioned the post: &ldquo;Fashionable disinfectant #NaomiX#onthemove &ldquo;.</p>
<p>(Image: naomicampbell/Instagram)</p>
<p>In fact, Naomi has been very vocal about wearing goggles to keep safe during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In a previous post yesterday, she shared a video clip and captioned it: &ldquo;ALERT WEAR GOGGLES, protect your eyes!!! Said it on Tuesday! Watch what Dr. Fauci says and is telling us to do! Protect your eyes! NOT ONLY ON FLIGHTS #Swipe &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Today, Naomi also showed off on her Instagram Stories how she had stocked up on her food shopping for life in lockdown.</p>
<p>However, Naomi could not go through this weekend without giving a shout-out to her friend Beyonce Knowles Carter for having her participate in the film for her latest visual album, Black Is King.</p>
<p>(Image: DISNEY)</p>
<p>Sharing an image of the pair embracing from the film on her Instagram, Naomi showed the love for Queen Bey.</p>
<p>She captioned the screenshot: &quot; @beyonce#BlackIsKing &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Naomi posted a flirtatious comment on a face mask selfie of rumoured former flame Skepta.</p>
<p>Naomi wrote: &ldquo;Oh ohh&hellip; I had a dream last night and you were in it,&rdquo; adding a heart emoji with Cupid&rsquo;s arrow through it.</p>
<p>(Image: naomicampbell/Instagram)</p>
<p>The pair were believed to have dated back in 2018 but when a fan speculated on a potentially bad break-up between the two of them, Naomi quashed such talk.</p>
<p>She replied to the comment: &ldquo;STOP. All love between Us @skeptagram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do you think of Naomi Campbell&rsquo;s lockdown look in her hazmat suit?</p>

<h3 id="this-week-in-late-night-naomi-campbell-on-wwhl">&ldquo;This Week In Late Night: Naomi Campbell on WWHL!&rdquo;</h3>

A woman who thinks things are about to change. Photo: Bravo TV</p>
<p>I have to begin with a mea culpa. In my column last week, I misspelled Andy Sandberg’s name, as some astute readers pointed out on Twitter. I am deeply sorry for misspelling Andi Sanburg’s name, which is famously one of the worst things you can do to another human being. I solemnly swear to do better in the future and that I will never misspell Andee Snailbug’s name ever again.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve issued a perfect apology, this was a huge week in late night, because the Emmy nominations were announced on Tuesday. Remember award shows? That thing where celebrities give other celebrities tiny little trophies for being exceptionally celebrity-esque in any given year? There’s truly nothing I love more. The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert were the lucky five to get nominated for Outstanding Variety Talk Series, while Late Night With Seth Meyers took Emmy host Jimmy Kimmel’s slot for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. Somewhat surprisingly, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon didn’t score any nominations, despite being wildly popular with wine moms across the country. The only duo more deserving of an Emmy nomination than Winnie and Franny is Desus &amp; Mero.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for me to announce the Emmy nominees for Best Moment in Late-Night Television the Last Week of July. And the nominees are …</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Seth Rogen Drinks Pickle Juice on The Tonight Show</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Jimmy Fallon didn’t receive any Emmy nominations this year, he does get a slot on this list for his subtle work in the “Pickle Juice Challenge” co-starring Seth Rogen. Inspired by Rogen’s upcoming film An American Pickle, Fallon challenged Rogen to a pickle-themed trivia contest, which saw the pair take a shot of pickle juice whenever the other answered a question correctly about pickles, which was surprisingly often. While I don’t particularly like or care for pickles (sorry), Rogen drinking pickle juice in a fun, patterned shirt with his pinky up is an undeniable mood. Come to think of it, my favorite thing about pickle juice is Nicki Minaj’s infamous monologue about pickle juice, which is 90 percent of the reason this clip made the list. Also, Rogen’s cool-ass glasses. He’s bossed up.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Desus and Mero’s Baroque Boys Verzuz Battle</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m sorry, but who else is doing it like the Bodega Baroque Boys? Desus and Mero gloriously spoofed the Verzuz battle trend with their very own historically accurate Verzuz battle between Beethoven and his alter ego Jayhoven. The segment was set during the Black Plague, so Desus told everyone to wear their masks and “keep a sack of onions in your left pocket,” while Mero softly suggested that maybe if people stopped defecating in the street then drinking the water, the plague would maybe go away. Why there is no GIF of Desus licking the strings of his violin yet is a mystery to me, but so is the fact that Desus &amp; Mero didn’t get nominated for an Emmy. Special shout-out to whoever made the comment section and made the Instagram handles “!SuckMyDickBach!”, “DJharpsikhaled”, and my personal favorite, “REAL_Claude_DeBU$$Y.” Pop that, Debussy.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>John Oliver on Uighurs in China</li>
</ol>
<p>The first late-night show to be nominated for an Emmy to appear on this list, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver tackled the alarming human-rights abuses currently happening to the Uighur people, an ethnic minority group mostly located in northwestern China, at the hands of the Chinese government. As per usual, Oliver was able to pack in an incredible amount of information detailing the atrocities that are currently being waged against the Uighur people, who are being sent to forced labor camps and “reeducation centers” where they are unable to leave of their own volition, while also, somehow, managing to throw in a plethora of jokes. While censorship is obviously very bad, I wouldn’t mind seeing an animated series starring the cactus in a Santa hat. Oliver ended the segment by calling out companies such as Nike and Volkswagen for using Uighur labor to make their products, both of which claimed they were “unaware” of the human-rights atrocities happening in their very own factories. Look, I know things are pretty bleak in the USA right now, but what’s happening to the Uighurs is incredibly alarming and deserves our attention.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Trevor Noah Shines a Light on Black Women</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking of things that deserve our collective attention, this week on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah devoted a segment to highlighting and celebrating Black women. In the latest installment of “If You Don’t Know, Now You Know,” Noah detailed the history of the erasure of Black women as leaders of social-justice movements, from Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells, and Mary Church Terrell in the women’s suffrage movement all the way to the Black Lives Matter movement founded by Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors. The segment was such a great example of how whitewashed history is. I clearly remember learning about Susan B. Anthony (she’s on a coin) and Elizabeth Cady Stanton (Seneca Falls Convention, let’s go) in grade school, but I absolutely didn’t hear the names Ida B. Wells or Mary Church Terrell uttered in an academic context until my junior year of college, and that is an example of academic misogynoir. Merci beaucoup to Trevor Noah et. al for educating the masses and centering Black women in the narrative, while also serving an incredible example of Black French New Wave Cinema.</p>
<ol>
<li>Naomi Campbell Being Naomi Campbell</li>
</ol>
<p>In the spirit of centering Black women and giving credit where credit is due, the Emmy Award for Best Late-Night Television Performance in the Last Week of July goes to [opens envelope] none other than Naomi Campbell. The supermodel stopped by Watch What Happens Live this week and did what she does best: look breathtakingly gorgeous and deliver absolutely massive amounts of shade. While everything Campbell said was a delight, the best moment happened when Andy Cohen asked her thoughts about Anna Wintour’s statement about Vogue not finding enough ways to elevate Black creators. “I think things are about to change, don’t you?” said Campbell, encapsulating everything there is to say about Wintour, Condé Nast, and the world at large in one perfect sentence. Her delivery, her laugh at the end, her lean into the camera — it’s all exquisite. It’s work on par with Dakota Johnson’s “That’s not true, Ellen” and should be recognized as such. Campbell went on to express how much she hated being tokenized in the fashion industry and the need for equality in all levels of of every industry, but in that one sentence she said everything that needed to be said. A well-deserved (fake) Emmy win by Ms. Campbell.

She has been taking extreme caution while travelling during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>But Naomi Campbell was taking no chances yet again for a flight on Friday, as she shared a selfie from the plane where she donned a full hazmat suit.</p>
<p>The supermodel, 50, recently shared a video on her Instagram titled, &lsquo;ALERT WEAR GOGGLES&rsquo; where she talked fans through the importance of wearing eye protection while travelling.</p>
<p>Safety first: Naomi Campbell was taking no chances for flight on Friday and shared a selfie from the plane where she donned a full hazmat suit fit with goggles and a mask</p>
<p>The selfie showed Naomi sat on what appears to be a pink blanket covering the aeroplane seat while she is covered head to toe in the white protective equipment.</p>
<p>Naomi wore a shield over her mask and eye goggles as she held up a tube of disinfectant wipes with &lsquo;Naomix&rsquo; printed on the side.</p>
<p>The catwalk queen titled the post: &lsquo;Fashionable disinfectant #NaomiX #onthemove.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Supermodel: Naomi recently clarified that she has been deep cleaning her seats on aeroplanes for 15-17 years</p>
<p>On the move: The catwalk queen titled the post: &lsquo;Fashionable disinfectant #NaomiX #onthemove&rsquo;</p>
<p>And it is not the first time Naomi has opted for head-to-toe protection on a flight after she shared a selfie in May wearing a hazmat suit and mask.</p>
<p>Naomi recently clarified that she has been deep cleaning her seats on aeroplanes for 15-17 years and only decided to document it last year, she stressed that COVID-19 is &lsquo;all new for her&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The fashion icon has also previously stressed that she wasn&rsquo;t wearing the outfit to be &lsquo;humorous&rsquo; and &lsquo;for a laugh&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Taking no chances: Naomi shared a selfie from a plane in May where she donned a full hazmat suit fit with goggles and a mask</p>
<p>Instead clarifying: &lsquo;This is how I feel comfortable travelling if I have to. I&rsquo;m keeping it [travelling] at a minimum. If I do have to go, I&rsquo;m keeping it like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Naomi celebrated her 50th birthday in May during amid lockdown restrictions and described the low-key day as &lsquo;surreal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The supermodel told Daily Pop of her celebrations during lockdown: &lsquo;It was a surreal day. A surreal and serene day with social distancing with some friends. Just four of us. I&rsquo;m very happy to get to 50.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the lockdown Naomi has shared various pics dressed in her protective gear and urged fans to &lsquo;wear gloves&rsquo; and &lsquo;be safe.&rsquo;

<h3 id="best-beauty-instagrams-of-the-week-megan-thee-stallion-naomi-campbell-and-more">&ldquo;Best Beauty Instagrams of the Week: Megan Thee Stallion, Naomi Campbell, and More&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5f25c2b890d1d577bccca8c3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/116426677_2645628395676798_6126472138778178113_n%2520(1)%2520(2).jpg" alt="img">
This past week on Instagram, acts of well-deserved self-care were a priority. Showing herself the TLC she deserves while healing, Megan Thee Stallion cuddled up in her bed with a few essentials: water, a sketch pad, a notebook, and a few important affirmations including “pray,” “write music,” and “take care of skin!” With a dewy complexion, singer Ari Lennox enjoyed a sunlit sweat session with her boxing trainer, inspiring followers to keep moving while in quarantine.</p>
<p>Speaking of sun, many beauty muses celebrated summer with some safe sunbathing. Model Arlenis Sosa radiated warmth while basking in some seaside glory, while Victoria Beckham got up close and personal, enjoying a “perfect summer morning” while rocking her newest lip shade, Chérie. At Jones Beach, model Coco Mitchell soaked up the rays and breeze while staying “fully protected from the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a more glamorous note, Guido Palau took us back to Chloe&rsquo;s Spring 2020 show with a profile shot of model Grace Elizabeth rocking a soft chignon that paired nicely with a dark lip courtesy of Pat McGrath. Finally, Tracee Ellis Ross, wearing a bright lip and sleek bun with a hair scarf, proved a little at-home photo shoot “to keep the Zooms spicy” is good for the soul.

<p>Here is your by no means comprehensive list of things that have so far been cancelled in 2020: the Olympics, festivals, fashion shows, Wimbledon, weddings, holidays, impulsive first date snogging. Also seemingly put into cold storage? Glamour.</p>
<p>As we hunkered down into elasticated waists and stretchy fabrics, clothes that delivered big on va-va-voom – date night dresses, high heels, twinkly clutch bags – were swiftly put on furlough. After all, who needs fashion for making an entrance when the only place you’re actually entering is the supermarket? But clothes can have the power to lift the spirits and put swagger in your step, meaning it’s time to vigorously embrace glamour again.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for inspiration, we’d advise you to go straight to the top. Nobody has ever channeled glamour as confidently, spectacularly and unapologetically as Naomi Campbell, whose ’90s style is the latest subject of our Fashback series. She’s not called a ‘fashion icon’ for nothing (it&rsquo;s even been made official; she was the recipient of a special Icon Award at the 2019 Fashion Awards).</p>
<p>One of the original supermodels – along with the likes of Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, who famously wouldn’t get out of bed for less than $10,000 – Streatham-born Campbell and the rest of the glossy posse rose to fame in the ’80s and ’90s garnering mega-bucks contracts and column inches in equal measure. They defined the look of the era in iconic shoots by Peter Lindbergh and Herb Ritts, in George Michael’s Freedom! ’90 video, and arm-in-arm on the runway with Gianni Versace.</p>

<p>Although today’s models might favour an apparently zero-effort look that revolves around jeans, boots and baggy layers, Naomi is a woman born for the red carpet. It’s impossible to look at her ’90s gowns and thigh-grazing mini dresses with their blingy embellishment, jewel tones and bold prints and not smile. She is so at-ease in glamour that she wore a feather boa – an item that would make most of us look, frankly, ridiculous – to the 1991 Grammy Awards. We are not worthy.</p>

<p>Naomi’s is a look which still feels impactful now (and indeed today, aged 50 and having been in the public eye for four decades, she still has the mega-watt star power to outshine anyone else on the red carpet). Just ask Kim Kardashian, whose fondness for luxe vintage, has led her to wear pieces by Versace, Alaïa and Thierry Mugler originally worn by Naomi the first time around. Imitation might be the highest form of flattery – but you don’t really get the impression Naomi needs any of that.</p>
<p>You might not yet have any occasions to go the full Naomi in your style - although you would undoubtedly cause a stir in the frozen food aisle - but a sprinkle of embellishment, a tighter or shorter silhouette than you might normally dare, or a pair of &lsquo;just because&rsquo; heels will all tap into the spirit.</p>

<p>Indeed, although diamonds don&rsquo;t hurt, spirit is what authentic glamour is all about. It’s Naomi’s confidence which has always given her looks that hard-to-define, impossible-to-miss X-factor (when asked why she had never appeared in a Victoria’s Secret show, she quipped ‘they couldn’t afford me’). Does that make her a diva? Absolutely - but, and this is an important distinction, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make her &lsquo;difficult&rsquo;. True glamour requires true self-assurance to pull off. Naomi has never been afraid to be seen and heard. You can hear it in her words (she has been vocal about racism in the fashion industry) and see it in her clothes, which let you know loud and clear: this is who I am, take it or leave it. And that’s why, then and now, she will always put the ‘super’ in supermodel.
