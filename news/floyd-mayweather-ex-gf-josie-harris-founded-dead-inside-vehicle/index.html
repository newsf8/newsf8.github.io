<p>Josie Harris, the ex-girlfriend, and mother of the legendary boxer Floyd Mayweather has been found dead on Monday night.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old woman was in her car when she was found at her home in Valencia town.</p>
<p>According to TMZ “She was pronounced dead at the scene. “We’re told there does not appear to be any foul play and the case is being treated as a death investigation as opposed to a homicide probe.”</p>
<p>Mayweather and Harris have been in a lot of circumstances before but there is no indication that this has a connection with the death.</p>
<p>In the past, Harris came out in the open and said that she was abused physically by the boxer at least 6 times just before the biggest brutal she received in September of 2010. Their son, Koraun, 15-year-old, saw what happened. Mayweather spent 0 days in prison for what he did.</p>
<p>The two of them have 3 children together and even they were apart, they still constantly argue and one of the causes of this was her dating another man. It was reported that on the evening of that September, the police were summoned and the boxer was able to exit the house.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, she fell asleep on her couch, the boxer then returned with someone. Koraun who was not sleeping at that time went to the door and saw it was his dad so the child let him in upon his insisting.</p>
<p>Mayweather then went to Harris and was shouting and yanking her hair.</p>
<p>During that time, his dad ordered Koraun to stay in his bedroom, lock the door and don’t do anything. He saw what his dad was doing to his mom, tried to go for help but Mayweather’s companion stopped him. From then on, he publicly said that his father was a coward.</p>
<p>Several years passed by, Josie Harris seemed to have forgiven Mayweather and told TMZ, “Shit happens. I’m not mad at him at all. love Floyd to death. Floyd loves his kids and is a great father. He would never do anything like that again … I’m sorry the situation happened … now we will just progress and start over and move forward together.”</p>
<p>Mayweather didn’t plead guilty. During an interview in 2015, he mentioned, “Did I kick, stomp, and beat someone? No, that didn’t happen. Did I restrain a woman that was on drugs? Yes, I did. So, if they say that’s domestic violence, then, you know what? I’m guilty. I’m guilty of restraining someone.”</p>
<p>Mayweather is one of the highest-earning sports stars then, he was arrested or cited from 5 different women. One of the women was Jackson, who filed a civil lawsuit against the boxer, also imprisonment and pointing a gun at her.</p>
<p>Harris also sued Mayweather $20 million for the damages for defamation, intentional infliction, and distress.</p>
<p>In 2017, Harris again exclaimed about their relationship and said, “I was a battered woman. I felt embarrassed about saying I was a battered woman. I felt shame. I felt like it was my fault. What did I do? I didn’t understand what a battered woman was at that time.”</p>
