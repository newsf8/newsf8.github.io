Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said on Thursday that drug trafficking charges by the United States against President Nicolas Maduro announced earlier in the day showed the &ldquo;desperation&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Washington elite&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Arreaza said the decision by the administration of US President Donald Trump to offer rewards for the capture of Maduro and other high-ranking officials accused of drug trafficking show the administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;obsession&rdquo; with Venezuela, which he said was due to its desire to reap &ldquo;electoral returns&rdquo; in the US state of Florida.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>Trump was &ldquo;once more attacking the Venezuelan people and its democratic institutions, using a new form of coup d&rsquo;etat based on miserable, vulgar and unfounded accusations,&rdquo; Arreaza added.</p>
<p>In an extremely rare criminal case against a foreign head of state, the US Department of Justice indicted Maduro and several of his top ministers after accusing him of leading a cocaine-trafficking group called &ldquo;The Cartel of the Suns&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The US Department of State offered a reward of up to $15m for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Maduro, whose country has been convulsed by years of a deep economic crisis and political upheaval.</p>
<p>The indictment marks a serious new phase against Maduro by Washington at a time when some US officials have privately said Trump is increasingly frustrated with the results of his Venezuela policy.</p>
<p>US Attorney General William Barr, announcing charges that include narco-terrorism conspiracy, corruption, and drug trafficking, accused Maduro and his associates of colluding with a dissident faction of the demobilised Colombian armed group, the FARC, &ldquo;to flood the United States with cocaine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the Venezuelan people suffer, this cabal lines their pockets with drug money and the proceeds of their corruption,&rdquo; Barr said of Maduro and the others who were indicted.</p>
<p>Maduro is already under US sanctions and has been the target of a US effort aimed at pushing him from power. He took office in 2013 after the death of his mentor President Hugo Chavez, a staunch foe of the US.</p>
<p>Other Venezuelan officials whose indictments were announced on Thursday include Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, senior socialist leader Diosdado Cabello, and the chief justice of the country&rsquo;s supreme court, Maikel Jose Moreno Perez, who was charged with money laundering. The US government is offering $10m for information leading to Cabello&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>The US and dozens of other countries have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela&rsquo;s legitimate president, regarding Maduro&rsquo;s 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country&rsquo;s military and by Russia, China and Cuba.</p>
<p>US officials have long accused Maduro and his associates or running a &ldquo;narco-state,&rdquo; saying they have used proceeds from drugs shipped from neighbouring Colombia to make up for lost revenue from a Venezuelan oil sector hit by heavy sanctions by the US.

<h3 id="venezuelas-coronavirus-response-might-surprise-you">Venezuela’s Coronavirus Response Might Surprise You</h3>
<p><img src="https://venezuelanalysis.com/files/images/%5Bsite-date-yyyy%5D/%5Bsite-date-mm%5D/venezuela_covid-19.jpg" alt="img">
Within a few hours of being launched, over 800 Venezuelans in the U.S. registered for an emergency flight from Miami to Caracas through a website run by the Venezuelan government. This flight, offered at no cost, was proposed by President Nicolás Maduro when he learned that 200 Venezuelans were stuck in the United States following his government’s decision to stop commercial flights as a preventative coronavirus measure. The promise of one flight expanded to two or more flights, as it became clear that many Venezuelans in the U.S. wanted to go back to Venezuela, yet the situation remains unresolved due to the U.S. ban on flights to and from the country.</p>
<p>Those who rely solely on the mainstream media might wonder who in their right mind would want to leave the United States for Venezuela. Time, The Washington Post, The Hill and the Miami Herald, among others, published opinions in the past week describing Venezuela as a chaotic nightmare. These media outlets painted a picture of a coronavirus disaster, of government incompetence and of a nation teetering on the brink of collapse. The reality of Venezuela’s coronavirus response is not covered by the mainstream media at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what each of these articles shortchanges is the damage caused by the Trump administration’s sanctions, which devastated the economy and healthcare system long before the coronavirus pandemic. These sanctions have impoverished millions of Venezuelans and negatively impact vital infrastructure, such as electricity generation. Venezuela is impeded from importing spare parts for its power plants and the resulting blackouts interrupt water services that rely on electric pumps. These, along with dozens of other implications from the hybrid war on Venezuela, have caused a decline in health indicators across the board, leading to 100,000 deaths as a consequence of the sanctions.</p>
<p>Regarding coronavirus specifically, the sanctions raise the costs of testing kits and medical supplies, and ban Venezuela’s government from purchasing medical equipment from the U.S. (and from many European countries). These obstacles would seemingly place Venezuela on the path to a worst-case scenario, similar to Iran (also battered by sanctions) or Italy (battered by austerity and neoliberalism). In contrast to those two countries, Venezuela took decisive steps early on to face the pandemic.</p>
<p>As a result of these steps and other factors, Venezuela is currently in its best-case scenario. As of this writing, 11 days after the first confirmed case of coronavirus, the country has 86 infected people, with 0 deaths. Its neighbors have not fared as well: Brazil has 1,924 cases with 34 deaths; Ecuador 981 and 18; Chile 746 and 2; Peru 395 and 5; Mexico 367 and 4; Colombia 306 and 3. (With the exception of Mexico, those governments have all actively participated and contributed to the U.S.-led regime change efforts in Venezuela.) Why is Venezuela doing so much better than others in the region?</p>
<p>Skeptics will claim that the Maduro government is hiding figures and deaths, that there’s not enough testing, not enough medicine, not enough talent to adequately deal with a pandemic. But here are the facts:</p>
<p>First, international solidarity has played a priceless role in enabling the government to rise to the challenge. China sent coronavirus diagnostic kits that will allow 320,000 Venezuelans to be tested, in addition to a team of experts and tons of supplies. Cuba sent 130 doctors and 10,000 doses of interferon alfa-2b, a drug with an established record of helping COVID-19 patients recover. Russia has sent the first of several shipments of medical equipment and kits. These three countries, routinely characterized by the U.S. foreign policy establishment as evil, offer solidarity and material support. The United States offers more sanctions and the IMF, widely known to be under U.S. control, denied a Venezuelan request for $5 billion in emergency funding that even the European Union supports.</p>
<p>Second, the government quickly carried out a plan to contain the spread of the disease. On March 12, a day before the first confirmed cases, President Maduro decreed a health emergency, prohibited crowds from gathering, and cancelled flights from Europe and Colombia. On March 13, Day 1, two Venezuelans tested positive; the government cancelled classes, began requiring facemasks on subways and on the border, closed theaters, bars and nightclubs, and limited restaurants to take-out or delivery. It bears repeating that this was on Day 1 of having a confirmed case; many U.S. states have yet to take these steps. By Day 4, a national quarantine was put into effect (equivalent to shelter-in-place orders) and an online portal called the Homeland System (Sistema Patria) was repurposed to survey potential COVID-19 cases. By Day 8, 42 people were infected and approximately 90% of the population was heeding the quarantine. By Day 11, over 12.2 million people had filled out the survey, over 20,000 people who reported being sick were visited in their homes by medical professionals and 145 people were referred for coronavirus testing. The government estimates that without these measures, Venezuela would have 3,000 infected people and a high number of deaths.</p>
<p>Third, the Venezuelan people were positioned to handle a crisis. Over the past 7 years, Venezuela has lived through the death of wildly popular leader, violent right-wing protests, an economic war characterized by shortages and hyperinflation, sanctions that have destroyed the economy, an ongoing coup, attempted military insurrections, attacks on public utilities, blackouts, mass migration and threats of U.S. military action. The coronavirus is a different sort of challenge, but previous crises have instilled a resiliency among the Venezuelan people and strengthened solidarity within communities. There is no panic on the streets; instead, people are calm and following health protocols.</p>
<p>Fourth, mass organizing and prioritizing people above all else. Communes and organized communities have taken the lead, producing facemasks, keeping the CLAP food supply system running (this monthly food package reaches 7 million families), facilitating house-by-house visits of doctors and encouraging the use of facemasks in public. Over 12,000 medical school students in their last or second-to-last year of study applied to be trained for house visits. For its part, the Maduro administration suspended rent payments, instituted a nationwide firing freeze, gave bonuses to workers, prohibited telecoms from cutting off people’s phones or internet, reached an agreement with hotel chains to provide 4,000 beds in case the crisis escalates, and pledged to pay the salaries of employees of small and medium businesses. Amid a public health crisis - compounded by an economic crisis and sanctions - Venezuela’s response has been to guarantee food, provide free healthcare and widespread testing, and alleviate further economic pressure on the working class.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has not responded to the Maduro administration’s request to make an exception for Conviasa Airlines, the national airline under sanctions, to fly the Venezuelans stranded in the United States back to Caracas. Given everything happening in the United States, where COVID-19 treatment can cost nearly $35,000 and the government is weighing the option of prioritizing the economy over the lives of people, perhaps these Venezuelans waiting to go home understand that their chances of surviving the coronavirus – both physically and economically – are much better in a country that values health over profits.</p>

<h3 id="venezuela-confirm-whereabouts-of-disappeared-oil-executive">Venezuela: Confirm Whereabouts of Disappeared Oil Executive</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/multimedia_images_2020/202003americas_venezuela_heli_0.jpg?itok=duUU3_ue" alt="img">
Expand El Helicoide is a building in Caracas, Venezuela that functions as one of the headquarters of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN). © 2018 Jimmy Villalta / VWPics via AP Imag (New York) – Venezuelan security forces should immediately stop arbitrarily detaining and forcibly disappearing people, no matter how long the disappearance, Human Rights Watch said today. International pressure and investigations into these abuses are key to pressuring authorities to end this practice.</p>
<p>On March 18, 2020, Tomeu Vadell Recalde, a CITGO Petroleum Corporation executive arbitrarily detained by the Nicolás Maduro government, called his family. The brief call, in which he did not say where he was being held, was his first contact with his family since intelligence agents took him away 42 days earlier. His lawyer has been unable to speak with him and neither the lawyer nor Vadell’s family have been able to confirm his whereabouts.</p>
<p>“It’s bad enough Venezuelan security forces have arbitrarily detained thousands of people, but they have also resorted to enforced disappearances – a perverse and globally prohibited crime in all circumstances – by deliberately hiding the whereabouts of people taken into custody,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “When this happens, the disappeared person is defenseless and the family faces levels of uncertainty and suffering that are inhuman and abusive.”</p>
<p>Officers from the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) detained Vadell, a dual Venezuelan-United States citizen, with five other CITGO executives in November 2017, hours after they landed in Caracas from the US for a meeting convened by Venezuelan authorities.</p>
<p>They were accused of signing a deal that was unfavorable for the Venezuelan state owned company PDVSA, of which CITGO is a subsidiary, and charged with willful embezzlement, money laundering and criminal association. The deal, however, was never signed, and Vadell was not involved in any negotiations around it, his lawyer told Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>After spending two years in detention at DGCIM headquarters in Caracas, a judge ordered Vadell’s transfer to house arrest on December 9, 2019, but intelligence agents moved him to an unknown location on February 5, 2020, in an apparent retaliation after US President Donald Trump hosted the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó during his State of the Union in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>His lawyer only saw the order reversing the house arrest on February 19, when a judge instructed Vadell to be held in custody at the Bolivarian National Intelligence Services (SEBIN) headquarters in Caracas, a facility called El Helicoide.</p>
<p>On February 19, when Vadell and the other executives’ trial was scheduled to start, none were brought to the courthouse, and the trial was postponed. It has since been postponed two more times. Their preliminary hearing, prior to being charged, was delayed 16 times.</p>
<p>Vadell’s family fears for his health, given that he suffers heart and kidney problems and hypertension. These health preconditions put him at further risk at a time when coronavirus is spreading through Venezuela. There are 91 confirmed coronavirus cases in Venezuela as of March 25, including at least 4 potential cases in El Helicoide, amid a collapsing health system and unreliable official data.</p>
<p>The enforced disappearance of Vadell is not an isolated case, but rather part of a pattern by Venezuelan authorities in recent years. The United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances found there is “a pattern of short-term enforced disappearances of political opponents or persons perceived as such, and their relatives” in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Vadell’s case is currently under consideration by the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, as well as the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. They should urgently call on Venezuelan authorities to immediately release Vadell, Human Rights Watch said.</p>
<p>In an upcoming report, the Robert Francis Kennedy (RFK) Human Rights and Foro Penal, a Venezuelan group that connects human rights activists and pro bono criminal lawyers, say they have recorded 200 cases of short-term disappearances in 2018 and 524 in 2019.</p>
<p>The victims were detained by security forces for an average of five to eight days without anyone being informed of their whereabouts, many of them were tortured in detention, and members of the military generally remained disappeared for more days than civilians, the organizations found.</p>
<p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported in July 2019 that there have been 135 cases of people arbitrarily deprived of their liberty between 2014 and 2019 in Venezuela, some of which included short-term enforced disappearances.</p>
<p>Other cases that follow a similar pattern to Vadell’s involve political opponents. Roberto Marrero, a member of the Voluntad Popular opposition party, was arbitrarily detained by SEBIN on March 21, 2019 around 2 a.m. He did not have contact with his family or lawyers for 52 days after being detained. Marrero was accused of conspiracy, money laundering, association to commit a crime, and concealment of weapons. Marrero’s wife told Human Rights Watch her husband has been held in isolation since February 13, 2020. She said she is worried about the impact on his health with the spread of coronavirus, as Marrero suffers from asthma and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Similarly, Gilber Caro, a National Assembly opposition congressman, was detained and forcibly disappeared in April 2019 by SEBIN. His whereabouts were unknown for over a month. He was released in June, but detained again on December 20. His whereabouts were once again unknown for a month, until January 20, when he was allowed a visit from a family member and his lawyer. Caro is being prosecuted for terrorism.</p>
<p>In September 2019, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution to create an independent fact-finding mission to investigate serious human rights violations in Venezuela, including enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the country since 2014. The mission is scheduled to present its findings in September 2020, which could contribute to a preliminary examination of Venezuela that the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is undertaking.</p>
<p>“In a country where there is no judicial independence, victims’ only hope for accountability is abroad,” Vivanco said. “It is therefore critical that the UN fact-finding mission report includes a thorough analysis of this pattern of short-term enforced disappearances in Venezuela and looks into individual responsibility at the highest levels.”
