<p>Bhushan Kumar took on the responsibility of managing his father&rsquo;s company at the age of 19, due to Gulshan Kumar&rsquo;s untimely death in the year 1997. After becoming the new managing director of T-Series, he quickly took on the responsibility that comes with the post. Previously, T-Series solely focused on the cassette industry, but Bhushan revolutionised this and adopted a more modern approach. With his advent, the company flourished more than ever before. It started making soundtracks in the digital format too, as people used CDs more than cassettes. The company made news when the official YouTube channel of T-Series received more viewership than any other YouTube channel. This made Bhushan Kumar richer than before and as of 2019, the estimated net worth of Bhushan is apparently said to be over $50 million according to Celebrity Worth, a leading website which records the net worth of celebrities.</p>

Rags to riches</p>
<p>From across the table, I overhear Bhushan Kumar, chairman and managing director of T-Series, discuss an unfinished song with a well-known Bollywood actor over the phone. Bhushan apologises sheepishly for the interruption, and we resume from where we left off. There are a few more such calls during our conversation, and each of them involves discussing a work-in-progress song. “I finished working on two other songs today, even before this interview,” he says.</p>
<p>According to music industry veteran Atul Churamani, it is such attention to detail that makes T-Series so successful at what it does.</p>
<p>“Bhushan’s approach to the business is really hands on,” he says. Churamani is the managing director of Turnkey Music and Publishing, a company that publishes independent music, curates music events and mentors artists. “When Bhushan stepped in after his father’s death, he took the company to the next level. As far as the [Indian] music industry is concerned, he’s the biggest industrialist we have.”</p>
<p>The rise of T-Series is familiar to most Indians. Bhushan’s father, Gulshan Kumar, came from humble origins, and in the early 1980s he built the parent company, Super Cassettes Industries, from scratch. The label initially made a name for itself from selling devotional content in the form of hymns and prayers, and pirated film music. As the company grew, it began producing film music for Bollywood blockbusters. In 1997, when the Mumbai underworld assassinated his father, Bhushan took over the reins at the age of 19.</p>
<p>According to industry estimates, T-Series’ annual revenue is $100 million, with a market share of 70-80 percent. Outside India, it’s T-Series’ sudden and rapid rise on YouTube that has garnered the most interest. It has expanded its YouTube subscriber base from 18 million in 2017 to almost 100 million within the space of two years.

<p>PM CARES Donation Fund</p>
<p>With India battling the Coronavirus pandemic which has ensnared the globe in a vice-like grip, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set up a charitable trust where citizens, corporates, organisations and just about anyone else can contribute funds towards the relief effort.</p>
<p>The fund is called the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund, and is being called PM CARES Fund. The PM is the Chairman of this trust, with the Defence Minister, Finance Minister and Home Minister other members.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to donate to the fund, one of which is via a bank transfer, and donations will be exempted from income tax under section 80(G). As per PM Modi, the fund will also cater to other distressing situations, if they occur in the times ahead.</p>
<p>The PM-CARES Fund accepts micro-donations too. It will strengthen disaster management capacities and encourage research on protecting citizens.</p>
