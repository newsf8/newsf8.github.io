She is currently in America focusing on her modelling career and keeping fans updated with a series of sexy snaps.

And Demi Rose shared two more sensational pictures to her Instagram on Tuesday as she took part in a photoshoot in Miami.

The 24-year-old model donned a barely-there white bikini that just about covered her voluptuous assets.

Gorgeous: Demi Rose shared two sensational pics to her Instagram on Tuesday from a photoshoot in Miami where she donned a skimpy white two piece

She captioned the sultry snaps: 'She’s the kind of high only a deep soul can get stoned to'

The white bikini had clear straps that added a risque touch to the already skimpy appearance.

The English model wore her brunette tresses slicked back with a wet look and accentuated her pretty features with a glam palette of bronzed tones.

In the second snap of the series Demi posed with a side-on-angle which drew focus to her pert derriere and tumbling wavy tresses.

On Monday the beauty put on a jaw dropping display when she slipped her voluptuous physique into a barely-there bodysuit.

The model shared two photos to her Instagram in the sheer leopard print garment that featured a very high cut crotch.

She captioned the sultry shots: 'Wild spirit' with a paw print emoji.

The sheer top revealed her plunging cleavage and flashed her nude bra.

Later that day the model shared more scanty snaps as she filmed herself jumping on a treadmill.

Demi's recent post come after a candid Instagram post that saw her reflect on her 2019 and promise to take the new year by the horns.

Revealing that 2019 had been both the 'hardest', yet also 'best' year of her life, she penned: 'Wow what a year. It definitely has been the hardest year of my life but also the best year of my life.

'I’m proud of myself for getting through the hurdles I’ve faced and the growth that I’ve experienced. I’m ready to say goodbye to 2019 and I’m SO excited for what’s to come in this new year.'

The Instagram sensation has garnered the attention of 13.3 million followers since she propelled to fame after being romantically linked to Kylie Jenner's ex Tyga in 2016.

Despite her gruelling travelling schedule, the model insisted to MailOnline she sticks to her 'healthy' routine and she admitted nuts are the fattiest foods she eats.

In a past interview, Demi revealed: 'I try to keep as healthy as I can. With travelling, it's hard to work out, I travel across the world but try to keep my routine...

Fit: Despite her gruelling travelling schedule, the model insisted to MailOnline she sticks to her 'healthy' routine and she admitted nuts are the fattiest foods she eats

'Everyone says I'm the healthiest person they know. The fattiest thing I will ever eat is nuts and peanut butter.

'My figure just gains weight so fast. Any bad thing I eat my body isn't used to it and just puts on the weight. That means no birthday cake.

'All I've eaten today is nuts. I've managed to eat a whole pot. I feel guilty as there's a lot of fat in the nuts. That's my treat. So I'm happy.'
