<p>other-sports</p>
<p>Updated: May 28, 2020 19:59 IST</p>
<p>The much-delayed 36th National Games, scheduled for October-November in Goa, was on Thursday postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) recently asked the Goa government to host the National Games as scheduled from October 20 to November 4 this year.</p>
<p>However, a spurt in the number of novel coronavirus cases has led to a postponement. “The National Games organising committee has decided to postpone National Games due to COVID-19 pandemic,” Goa’s deputy chief minister Manohar (Babu) Ajgaonkar, who also holds the sports portfolio, was quoted as saying in a statement shared by IOA President Narinder Batra.</p>
<p>“&hellip; Committee to hold meeting in September end and decide on fixing dates for National Games. (Goa) Government to take advice from Union Sports Ministry, need four months advance notice to organise games,” Ajgaonkar’s statement added.</p>
<p>The previous edition of the Games was held back in 2015 in Kerala.</p>
<p>The upcoming Games, facing uncertainty for long, was originally scheduled for November 2018 but was postponed to April 2019. However, due to the general election, the government of Goa ordered another cancellation.</p>
<p>With the Games infrastructure nearing completion, the postponement is set to bring in big losses to the state government.</p>
<p>Last month, it had sought clarification from the Indian Olympic Association over the fate of the Games in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The coronavirus outbreak has brought all sporting activities to a grinding halt worldwide.</p>
<p>In India, major events like the Indian Premier League (IPL) have been postponed indefinitely and some tournaments cancelled.</p>
<p>There was hope for the Games to go ahead as scheduled as the state was marked in the green zone for quite a while.</p>
<p>But a sudden spurt has proved to be decisive. Goa has so far reported 68 confirmed cases for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>There were concerns about athletes coming here from other states, including the ones badly affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Batra had earlier expressed optimism that the National Games will go ahead as per schedule and will provide a perfect preparatory platform for the Tokyo Olympics-bound Indian athletes.</p>
<p>IOA joint secretary Namdev Shirgaonkar, who is also the vice president of Maharashtra Olympic Association, too had felt the Games should happen this year.

VHA moves HC against Hockey India’s move to disaffiliate</p>
<p>Non-affiliation from Hockey India might also bring downfall of the game in central India and put careers of budding players in jeopardy. (File photo)</p>
<p>Staff Reporter ;</p>
<p>WITH the sword of disaffiliation hanging on its head, the Vidarbha Hockey Association (VHA) on Friday moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court seeking urgent stay to the decision of Hockey India to disaffiliate VHA from July 1. VHA claimed that it was in existence since 1959 and applying ‘One State One Unit’ norm of Justice (retd) R M Lodha Committee report that applied to Cricket Boards would be unfair and unjust to VHA. In fact, VHA was not interested in getting voting right at all.</p>
<p>A division bench consisting of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor issued notice to Hockey India and posted the matter for final disposal on June 26. According to VHA, in Maharashtra, there are three units including VHA at Nagpur representing 22 districts of Vidarbha, Khandesh and Marathwada hockey players, Mumbai Hockey Association and Maharashtra Hockey Association at Pune. VHA has a glorious past and is in possession of 3.80 acre land at Civil Lines and 2.5 acre land at Sadar since five decades, where regular hockey tournaments and camps are held for players since decades.</p>
<p>The petitioner-association repeatedly stated that it was fighting the battle to retain the existence for the sake of the career of hundreds of hockey players of the region and was not interested in affairs of the national body now known as Hockey India (earlier Indian Hockey Federation). VHA Administrator Triloki Nath Sidhra in his petition also pointed out earlier attempts to dissuade Hockey India not to disaffiliate the association and let its players participate in Hockey India organised national championships. The letter was sent to Hockey India on February 19, 2020 followed by another representation dated May 29 but till date no reply has been received by the association, stated Adv Anand Parchure appearing for VHA.</p>
<p>On June 3, VHA forwarded the annual subscription fee, but the same was returned by Hockey India stating that since the VHA’s membership would cease to exist on July 1, there was no question of accepting the subscription fees, forcing VHA to knock the doors of the High Court. On January 6, 2020, Hockey India had asked VHA and several other Associate Units to merge with their State bodies by June 30, 2020, citing Indian Olympic Association’s ‘One State One Unit’ diktat.

<h3 id="ipl-governing-council-to-review-its-sponsorship-deals-after-border-clash-with-china">&ldquo;IPL Governing Council to review its sponsorship deals after border clash with China&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.businessworld.in/article/article_extra_large_image/https://aniportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/media/details/IPL_june19.jpg" alt="img">
Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 19 (ANI): The Indian Premier League (IPL) will review various sponsorship deals in its Governing Council meeting called for next week after 20 Indian soldiers died in a violent clash with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh.</p>
<p>Currently, Chinese mobile manufacturer Vivo is the title sponsor of the IPL and the Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) gets Rs 440 crore annually from the five-year deal ending in 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking note of the border skirmish that resulted in the martyrdom of our brave jawans, the IPL Governing Council has convened a meeting next week to review IPL&rsquo;s various sponsorship deals,&rdquo; IPL&rsquo;s official Twitter handle wrote in a post.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Indian Olympic Association&rsquo;s (IOA) treasurer Anandeshwar Pandey on Thursday said that the issue regarding snapping ties which Chinese sponsors will be discussed in the next executive committee meeting.</p>
<p>The tensions have been flaring up at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between Indian and Chinese troops and the calls for boycotting Chinese products are increasing by the minute.</p>
<p>Many people have urged organisations to discontinue Chinese investments in the country as well.</p>
<p>Taking about Chinese sponsors of IOA, Pandey told ANI, &ldquo;IOA will discuss the issue related to Chinese sponsorships in its executive committee meeting. This is something about which all members have to discuss in our executive committee meeting, no decision can be taken alone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>20 Indian Army personnel, including a Colonel, were killed in the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops.</p>
<p>Indian intercepts had revealed that the Chinese side suffered 43 casualties including dead and seriously injured in the violent clash. The commanding officer of the Chinese Unit is among those killed, sources had confirmed to ANI.</p>
<p>The IPL was scheduled to commence from March 29 but was postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the BCCI said it can host the IPL behind closed doors if the situation demands it. The board also said that it is working on all possible options to stage the tournament this year.</p>
<p>BCCI president Sourav Ganguly had stated the intention of going ahead with IPL this year in his letter to all affiliated members of the cricketing body. (ANI)</p>

<p>Five measures should be taken to prevent virus spread in absence of vaccine</p>
<p>The COVID-19 press conference today is on development of drugs, vaccines and technologies for testing. Niti Aayog Member (Heath) and Empowered Group Chairman Dr. V.K. Paul speaks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The final frontier for the fight against Covid-19 is science and technology. The base of our institutions of science and technology, bio-tech and pharma industry is strong. The entire infrastructure is engaged in the war against Covid-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. K. Vijayraghavan, Principal Scientific Advisor says: &ldquo;Five measures should be taken to prevent spread of Covid-19 - maintain hygiene, surface cleaning, physical distancing, tracking and testing. In the absence of drugs and vaccine, these steps can be taken by us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disease spreads as our immune response takes a little longer and the virus by that time overwhelmes us. The vaccine is given to those who are not infected, that&rsquo;s why safety is important. It usually takes 10 to 15 years to develop vaccines at a cost of 200-300 million dollars.</p>
<p>Parallel processing needed in order to develop vaccine in a year</p>
<p>Dr. Viijayraghavan continues: &ldquo;If we want to develop it in one year, parallel processing has to be done. 100 vaccines are being tested, instead of one. Simultaneously, we have to go fast on the regulatory process without compromising quality. We have to have manufacturing capability without compromising our standard immunising programme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to have a distribution system ready. This will require investment of 2 to 3 billion dollars, which is currently being done by the world. Our vaccine manufacturing is top class, of the three standard immunising vaccines, two are produced in India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For generics, India is one of the world&rsquo;s largest providers. Over the last few years, because of multiple kinds of investments, our vaccine companies are not only into manufacturing but also developing vaccines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start-ups and acadamics have also got into developing vaccines. There are about 30 groups in India, big industries to individual academics, of which 20 are keeping good pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four categories of vaccines can be there:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>MRNA vaccines, in which a component of genetic material of the virus is injected. Our body translates it into viral protein and develops immune system when the virus attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard vaccine: in which weak version of the virus is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protein coding region of the virus is attached to the backbone of another virus to develop vaccine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virus protein is developed in the lab and is used with another stimulant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Several companies are trying to develop it on the backbone of flu vaccine, it is in late pre-clinical trial stage and may be by October, pre-clinical trial would conclude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indian companies are collaborating with foreign companies. Academics are also trying to develop the vaccines. The logistics of making the vaccine available to everyone will be a big challenge.</p>
<p>Drugs</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drugs attack the virus chemically after it infects. This is a big challenge, as the virus uses our machinary to replicate. A drug has to be designed to attack only the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to attack the virus an early stage. There are two broad categories of drugs which can be developed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It can be repurposed drugs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>new drugs. Designing of new drugs is a major channel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;In India, in addition to our science agencies, the CSIR and AICTE have embarked on drug discovery hackethon where students are trained with info on how to do computational drug discovery, they will get access to expensive equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for testing and diagnosis, a new kind of test is likely to come up for testing of virus particle presence. Several nucleic acid tests have been developed, variations of RTPCR tests have been developed. Then there are antibody tests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests are high, they can be used to test at individual level. Otherwise, they can be used for community surveillance purpose.</p>
<p>Dr. K. Vijayraghavan continues: &ldquo;Till today, we have not observed any change in the virus that alters its fundamental properties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HCQ</p>
<p>Dr. V.K. Paul: &ldquo;Several trials have been done on the use of HCQ, it is also being done in India. Our experience so far is that as per the current guidelines for its use by frontline workers, its benefits outweigh any risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More research will throw light on new aspects, on the basis of which further decisions will be taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 20 new companies in India have developed diagnostic kits, which will be supplied all over the world after meeting domestic requirements. By July, the domestic companies will be producing 5 lakh kits per day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the drug front, we are trying many medicines, including oral medicine Favipiravir, plant-based medicine ACQH, Itolizumab (Also used for arthritis) BCG vaccine Micro-Bacterium W, Convalescent Plasma, Arbidol, and HCQ besides Ramdesivir. Eight vaccine candidates are being tried.&rdquo;</p>

Trader&rsquo;s body CAIT has urged Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal to make it mandatory for every e-commerce portal to mention ' country of origin ' on each product sold at their platforms, so that buyers can make an informed decision. Most e-commerce portals are selling Chinese goods , about which the consumer remains unaware, said the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which has launched a campaign for boycott of Chinese goods.&ldquo;I have asked him (Goyal) to amend the FDI policy Press Note no 2 which specifies do&rsquo;s for FDI backed e-commerce companies and framing of a general rule for Indian e-commerce firms.&ldquo;We have demanded Country of Origin in all matters related to imports from other countries and for indigenous manufacturers as well. Every product should have Country of origin,&rdquo; CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal told. The trader&rsquo;s body in a communication to chief ministers of all states urged to lead the campaign to boycott Chinese products. It has also urged political parties to issue support appeals in favour of the campaign.&ldquo;CAIT has also demanded that the Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI) cancel the sponsorship of Vivo and sponsorship of any other Chinese Company,&rdquo; the trader&rsquo;s body said, adding it has urged the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to withdraw sponsorship of Chinese companies, if any.

<p>Updated: May 13, 2020 16:34 IST</p>
<p>The state of Goa which will be hosting the 36th national games scheduled to be held later this year is looking at an uncertain future due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The national games were originally scheduled for November 2018 which were later postponed to April 2019. However, due to the general election, the government of Goa ordered cancellation.</p>
<p>Now, the games are scheduled to be held on October 20, 2020, to November 4, 2020, however, without the central government’s directives the future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Indian Olympic association joint secretary Namdev Shirgaonkar feels national games should happen this year.</p>
<p>“Whether it will be happening on the scheduled date cannot be assured currently due to the Covid-19 uncertainty. The Indian Olympic association will assess the situation before coming to a conclusion,” Shirgaonkar said.</p>
<p>The state of Goa is in a green zone which is a positive sign for the games however there will be no positive progress without clearances from the centre and Goa government.</p>
<p>“The National Games are very important for our athletes and it will be a good rehearsal for the Olympic qualified athletes as well. If games are postponed to 2021, then finding dates for the event will be very difficult since 2021 will be a jam-packed year for athletes,” added Shirgaonkar who is also the vice president of Maharashtra Olympic Association (MOA).</p>
<p>If national games are postponed in October, then it will bring in big loses to the state of Goa as they have almost completed the infrastructure needed for the games, he added</p>
<p>On Saturday, Shirgaonkar had a meeting over the zoom app with different sports associations in Maharashtra. The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the preparation of Maharashtra athletes for the national games.</p>
<p>“We conducted a meeting to plan the future. One cannot waste time in lockdown and there should be a plan for our athletes. Since everybody is in lockdown, athletes cannot come straight away and take part in national games, there should be a proper camp. We also discussed on ways we can motivate all athletes during the lockdown,” Shirgaonkar added.</p>
<p>Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju tweeted regarding resuming training for elite athletes in a phased manner after lockdown is lifted and Shirgaonkar feels it is the right way to move ahead.</p>
<p>“I completely support the views of our sports minister, I advised the same to the state association. We definitely need to have a camp for selected athletes in Maharashtra. We have centers in our state where we can train our athletes by taking all the precautions. Soon MOA will figure out a plan for their athletes,” added Shirgaonkar.</p>
<p>Shirgaonkar advised players to stay positive and keep preparing for the games in whatever way they can at home.
