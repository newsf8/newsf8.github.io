<p>In an unusual move, German and Swiss indie DCM Film International has snapped up German-language remake rights to Italian dramedy “Andrà Tutto Bene” (“Everything’s Gonna Be Alright”) directed by Francesco Bruni, even before the film’s theatrical release in Italy.</p>
<p>While one could be forgiven for thinking the title pertains to the coronavirus pandemic, this pic is instead about a down-and-out film director who discovers he has a form of leukemia for which he needs a stem cell transplant from a matching donor. The deal for German remake rights was inked during lockdown by Italy’s Vision Distribution and DCM. Bruni’s latest work had screened in still unfinished form at Berlin’s European Film Market in February. DCM is currently looking at various German directors and talents to attach to the project.</p>
<p>Since the film’s planned March release in Italy was postponed due the pandemic, Vision Distribution is now eyeing a fall release for “Tutto Bene,” which could also soon surface at a festival. Kim Rossi Stuart (“Crime Novel,” “Angel of Evil”) plays the lead. Pic is produced by Italy’s Palomar, which is owned by France’s Mediawan, in collaboration with Vision Distribution.</p>
<p>Bruni is a prominent Italian screenwriter-turned-director whose directorial debut “Scialla” (“Chill”) went to Venice in 2011 and played well in Germany, as did his more recent “Tutto Quello Che Vuoi” (“Friends by Chance”) about a young man’s rapport with an elderly poet with Alzheimer’s. Bruni’s writing credits comprise films by Paolo Virzì such as “Human Capital” and hit TV series “Montalbano.”</p>
<p>In “Tutto Bene” the sudden illness of the 46-year-old struggling director, who has also recently divorced, prompts major family issues, including with the protagonist’s father, who reveals a secret, and his two teen-age children.</p>
<p>“It’s not a hospital movie,” said Bruni, adding that the narrative “crisscrosses in time,” even going way back. “There are lots of childhood memories, though it’s not clear if they are real or instead dreams or hallucinations during chemotherapy,” he noted.</p>
<p>DCM managing director Christoph Daniel said they were really struck when they saw “Tutto Bene” in Berlin. “It was just a touching and very universal story, especially the whole family dynamic,” he said, noting that the narrative “is not specific to Italian society.” Daniel added that they “have certain directors and even actors in mind” for the German adaptation that they think “could be a great fit” for what will be the company’s first remake.</p>
<p>DCM has a close rapport with Italian cinema having released titles such as Paolo Sorrentino’s “The Great Beauty” and “Loro” and produced and distributed Jonas Carpignano’s “Mediterranea” and “A Ciambra.”</p>
<p>Vision Distribution chief Catia Rossi said that she’s been seeing an “an exponential growth in Italy of sales of remake rights, but that they are usually comedies.”</p>
<p>Remakes of Italian movies have been a hot commodity ever since 2016 concept movie “Perfect Strangers,” involving smartphones and personal secrets, got remade in a dozen countries, including Germany.</p>
<p>Rossi noted that all over the world companies are diversifying and shifting from distribution into production and in doing so “they tend to seek out stories that are already written.”

<h3 id="android-11-is-just-a-subtle-upgrade-and-thats-alright">&ldquo;Android 11 is just a subtle upgrade, and that’s Alright&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.techgamingreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Android-11-is-just-a-subtle-upgrade-and-thats-Alright.jpg" alt="img">
Belief article by C. Scott Brown</p>
<p>Now, Google produced the initially Android 11 beta. We’ve witnessed 4 developer previews for the running system so considerably, but right now marks the initially launch built not just for developers but for users of the normal public. Clearly, it is however a beta, so you ought to only set up it if you are snug with buggy devices.</p>
<p>With this 1st beta, we’re setting up to get a concrete strategy of what Android 11 will look and experience like. Regrettably, if you were being searching ahead to a drastic overhaul that would work in fully distinct techniques as compared to other variations of Android, you are going to be very let down.</p>
<p>Fact be told, Android 11 feels a whole lot like Android 10, which in change felt a ton like Android 9 Pie. In point, it’s been decades considering the fact that Android saw the variety of redesigns we witnessed in its early days, which may possibly make the OS sense a little…well…boring.</p>
<p>I would argue that Android 11 seeming lackluster is really a genuinely excellent matter. It suggests that the functioning method has matured to the place where things mainly works the way we want it to and all Google demands to concentrate on is subtle refinements.</p>
<p>Android altered a entire ton in its early times</p>
<p>There have been 18 big versions of Android so much. At initial, each new API version/dessert taste looked radically diverse from the prior model. Just take a search previously mentioned at an previous graphic we utilised to encourage a comparison amongst Android 2.3 Gingerbread and Android 4. Ice Cream Sandwich. Just the property screens ended up exceptionally distinctive, to say absolutely nothing about the application drawers, notification shades, options internet pages, and many others.</p>
<p>People two variations of Android came out inside of one particular yr of each and every other. A single 12 months!</p>
<p>Now, search at the differences concerning Android 9 Pie and Android 11, which are divided by almost two yrs:</p>
<p>Definitely, there are some dissimilarities there, but the total layout aesthetic continues to be unchanged. The icons, Google Search bar, temperature widget, and even fonts are all the exact.</p>
<p>I’m not heading to go into every single facet of the two variations in this article, but rely on me when I say that the app drawers, notification shades, and other facets of Android are all also remarkably identical across Pie and Android 11.</p>
<p>Associated: The most noteworthy new Android 11 attributes we have found so considerably</p>
<p>The big difference amongst the early days of Android and now is that Google has settled on what Android ought to be. It is taken a extensive time to get there, but it is figured out how ideal to existing the functioning technique to the user. There is simply no will need for it to go again to the drawing board every 12 months and wildly revamp what Android appears to be like like.</p>
<p>As an alternative, Google is now focusing on the trivia of earning Android superior and far more person-helpful. It’s not exciting, but it is crucial.</p>
<p>Android 11: The good type of dull</p>
<p>The trade-off here is that Android 11 won’t appear to be virtually as new and new as Android 4.4 KitKat felt. Long-time Android supporters may possibly call that dull, and they would not be improper.</p>
<p>Having said that, a dull working process is in fact what you should want. Try to remember how “boring” Home windows XP felt after several years of using it? Perfectly, Microsoft attempted to alter matters up a full ton with Home windows Vista, which people genuinely didn’t like. In response, the firm created Windows 7, which is effectively just a glossier, superior variation of Home windows XP. We obtained bored with Home windows 7 and Microsoft experimented with yet again to reinvent points with Windows 8, which persons also hated. Now, we have Home windows 10, which is a glossier, improved variation of Home windows 7.</p>
<p>Bear in mind when Microsoft tried out to reinvent the ‘boring’ Windows 7? Yeah, we all try to remember how that turned out…</p>
<p>The motive there was so significantly backlash for Windows Vista and Windows 8 is for the reason that Home windows is a experienced working procedure — it is been close to prolonged enough that individuals know how to use it and expect it to appear and operate in specified means. Way too much modify of a experienced OS is undesirable, no make a difference how “boring” it could be.</p>
<p>Which is in which Android is appropriate now, and Android 11 is proof that Google understands that. Google is smart ample to know that a wild revamp of Android at this stage would likely experience additional backlash than nearly anything else.</p>
<p>So don’t lament that Android 11 isn’t a shiny new knowledge for you to get hyped on. Alternatively, be material with the thought that Android is how it is, and it will likely be this way for a extensive time. That’s a good thing.

<h3 id="patrick-bailey-five-things-to-know-about-giants-2020-first-round-draft-pick">&ldquo;Patrick Bailey: Five things to know about Giants&rsquo; 2020 first-round draft pick&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/sites/csnbayarea/files/2020/06/11/patrickbaileygetty.jpg" alt="img">
For two days, we kind of, almost, just a little bit, had baseball back in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s been three months since players took the field, and sure, the owners and players appear to be as far apart as ever &hellip;</p>
<p>Update on negotiations between owners and the players: pic.twitter.com/ja3EslCid5 — Alex Pavlovic (@PavlovicNBCS) June 12, 2020</p>
<p>But the MLB draft provided a brief escape. It was a chance to cover guys who actually will be a big part of the game moving forward, and look back on past successes and failures. If you missed it, here&rsquo;s my story on first-rounder Patrick Bailey, a recap of the six picks made on Day 2, and a look at what&rsquo;s next for the Giants and their scouts.</p>
<p>Before we turn the page and refocus on the phrase &ldquo;pro rata,&rdquo; here are five final thoughts on this year&rsquo;s draft &hellip;</p>
<p>Did the Giants play it safe?</p>
<p>This was a draft unlike any other, and with two additional picks the Giants had a chance to get really creative if they wanted to. In the end, it seems they were mostly conservative. Six of their seven picks were college players, and none of them stood out for being far off the draft boards set up around the game. The wildest thing about the 2020 Giants class was that they took a catcher first when they did the same two years ago, but even that was fully defensible.</p>
<p>The Giants took a focused, traditional, best-player-available approach. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, to be clear. This is a farm system that&rsquo;s come a long way, but the Giants still need a couple of quality draft classes to get back into contention consistently. They took kids they had a lot of info on, and this group will further boost the system.</p>
<p>This will be a fascinating class to look back on in five years. Perhaps the Giants will wish they had taken more risks. For now, it looks like a solid group.</p>
<p>A sleeper from the Bay Area?</p>
<p>Opposing scouts liked the pick of Kyle Harrison, a left-handed starter from De La Salle. FanGraphs called him the &ldquo;icing&rdquo; on the cake for the Giants, and MLB Pipeline&rsquo;s draft experts rated Harrison as the best Giants pick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best healthy left-hander in the high school crop, Harrison could have landed in the second round but lasted until the third,&rdquo; MLB.com wrote. &ldquo;Polished and deceptive, he goes after hitters with a low-90s fastball, a nasty slider and an advanced changeup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not bad considering he was the fifth player selected by the Giants. Harrison was committed to UCLA, but the Giants &ndash; an organization with a few Bruins on rosters and one serving as GM &ndash; are very confident that they&rsquo;ll convince him to sign.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to really, really like about Giants third-round pick Kyle Harrison. Dominant at De La Salle pic.twitter.com/faSTT95nLb — Dalton Johnson (@DaltonJ_Johnson) June 12, 2020</p>
<p>Some team officials believe they have more pitching depth than they get credit for, but evaluators generally view most of their pitching prospects as more back-end guys. They need someone to pop and turn into a long-term ace, and Harrison looks like he at least has the equipment to take a crack at being that guy.</p>
<p>Never forget about the DH</p>
<p>The universal DH will be in play if the season resumes in 2020, and most within the game believes that&rsquo;ll be a permanent change, or at the very least will become permanent after the next CBA is negotiated in 18 months. Zaidi brought it up when asked about Joey Bart possibly learning a second position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what the future holds in terms of whether we go to a universal DH, but I think it&rsquo;s something that we want all of our catchers to do,&rdquo; he said of versatility.</p>
<p>A DH spot would add another lineup spot for a Bart or Bailey if they&rsquo;re both on the roster in a few years, and if both turn into good big leaguers, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to see how you could play them each 150ish times a year between catcher, DH and first base.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could argue that both players derive much of their value from being good hitters when compared to catchers. For example, Buster Posey could have benefited from being able to DH last season, but the Giants probably would have looked across the field and seen that most of their opponents still had a better hitter in that spot. It&rsquo;s not ideal long term to have two catchers in the lineup too often, but it is a nice way to make sure Bart and Bailey stay fresh.</p>
<p>[GIANTS INSIDER PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode]</p>
<p>Another catcher</p>
<p>When Bailey was drafted, everyone immediately started thinking about Bart. But I also thought about Ricardo Genoves. The 20-year-old was in camp as an extra catcher this spring and some Giants people really, really like him.</p>
<p>Genoves did a solid job in 19 games in Augusta last year and he&rsquo;s a big, strong catcher who has developing power from the right side. Some of the team&rsquo;s evaluators believe he&rsquo;s also a future big league starter behind the plate, and if he develops like that, it&rsquo;ll be one of the best things to happen to the system. Having three good young catching prospects will allow Zaidi and Scott Harris to go out and fill a hole elsewhere via a trade.</p>
<p>Trend watch</p>
<p>On the night of Round 1, Zaidi said he envisioned a balanced approach to the rest of the draft. The Giants ended up with four pitchers and three position players (one of whom can also pitch). That evens things up a bit after they took position players with nine of their first 10 selections last year.</p>
<p>[RELATED: Ranking Bailey in Giants&rsquo; system]</p>
<p>Overall, 86 of the 160 players selected by MLB teams were pitchers, with 63 of those being right-handers. Of the position players, there were 28 outfielders selected, 22 shortstops and 10 catchers.</p>
<p>The Giants are still hitter-heavy at the top of their system, but that&rsquo;s a good thing. They&rsquo;ve been starving offensively in recent years, and if they can ever figure that part out, it&rsquo;ll be much easier to build out the rest of the team. It has been proven over and over again in recent years that Oracle Park is a draw for free agent pitchers and can help make the ones in-house look a lot better.

Santa&rsquo;s Village will be back in business this summer after new guidance was released that will allow New Hampshire amusement parks to open with certain restrictions.&raquo; Download the free WMUR appThe amusement park is planning to open its doors for the first time in 2020 on July 1.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled that we&rsquo;ll get a chance to open this summer,&rdquo; said Jim Miller, of Santa&rsquo;s Village. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working pretty hard with a limited crew.&rdquo; Typically, Santa&rsquo;s Village opens around Memorial Day.

<h3 id="detroit-offers-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-hair-nail-salons-as-some-prep-for-monday-opening">&ldquo;Detroit offers rapid COVID-19 tests to hair, nail salons as some prep for Monday opening&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3-prod.crainsdetroit.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/6%20salon_i_0.jpg" alt="img">
Detroit barber shop and salon owners and their employees can get rapid COVID-19 tests over the weekend if they choose to reopen for business starting Monday.</p>
<p>Not all will. But Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on June 5 gave the go-ahead for Michigan hair and nail salons in Southeast Michigan to restart next week, among the last businesses to be able to do so. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan cautioned during a media briefing Thursday that salons are high-risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These constitute the highest risk of spread, because you are in very close contact with potential sharing airspace with your clients,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Hair and nail care shops, as well as independent contractors in those fields, can get free Abbott Laboratories tests Friday, Saturday and Sunday across from the Detroit Medical Center at Woodward and Mack avenues. Appointments are required and can be made by calling (313) 251-4488.</p>
<p>The city has been directing businesses to DetroitMeansBusiness.org, a website put together by a public-private group that has steps for reopening, financial resources and guidance on how to get protective equipment.</p>
<p>The mayor on Thursday encouraged businesses to publicly post their COVID-19 test results so customers can see them. Shops can also pick up small personal protective equipment kits from the city, Duggan said.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a first — Detroit has offered free testing to other sectors as they have reopened. And now any resident of metro Detroit can get tested for free at the former Michigan State Fairgrounds site. But it takes several days, as opposed to less than 30 minutes for the rapid Abbott Laboratories test. Detroit has defended its use of the rapid tests, though concerns have been raised over accuracy.</p>
<p>Some states are seeing an uptick in coronavirus cases, as reported by USA Today and other outlets. USA Today cited experts saying they can&rsquo;t be sure why cases are rising in some states, but that reopening sectors of the economy and various individual outbreaks are likely factors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gonna come up a little bit, and that&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Duggan said Thursday of positive COVID-19 testing rates. &ldquo;What we can&rsquo;t have happen is have them spike back up the way they were in March and April.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city has recorded 11,294 cases of the coronavirus since March. As of Thursday, 1,416 residents have died. The number of deaths per week has slowed over the last four weeks (taken in seven-day periods) from 42 per week to 35 per week to 22 per week and then nine in the most recent week, June 2-8.</p>
<p>6 Salon&rsquo;s downtown Detroit location is among those expecting to open Monday, offering bookings by phone and online. The local chain also has locations in Royal Oak and Birmingham.</p>
<p>It published a list of procedures on its website, asking clients to stay home if they have symptoms, to come in alone and on time, to maintain 6 feet of distance and sanitize. Wearing masks is mandatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask you to remain outside, wait in your vehicle, and aim to check-in with our front desk team 6 minutes before your scheduled appointment,&rdquo; 6 Salon says on its website. &ldquo;Waiting area occupancy will be limited to the number of individuals who can be present while maintaining proper social distancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marlene Brooks doesn&rsquo;t plan to open her Dymond Designs Beauty Studio on Jefferson Avenue until July 2. She said she wants to make sure all sanitation measures are in place, and said she&rsquo;s worried it&rsquo;s too soon. She knows people in the beauty industry who have died from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s too premature for me. Because we have too much contact, one-on-one, even though we&rsquo;re wearing face guards,&rdquo; Brooks said. &ldquo;The only thing we can do is try to protect, but the way they say this thing is highly contagious, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brooks has stockpiled masks, face shields and gallons of sanitizer, and ordered hand sanitizing stands to place in the salon. She said she&rsquo;s planning on not allowing anyone in the waiting room — just 16 people in the building at a time, one client per stylist.</p>
<p>Clients will move through more slowly, filling out forms and getting their temperatures checked, while stylists will need to stop and disinfect their stations. That means fewer than half the usual 10-12 clients per day for a stylist, she said.</p>
<p>In the governor&rsquo;s statewide reopening plan, salons come after restaurants, which were allowed to return to dine-in service as of Monday. Some restaurants chose to remain closed out of safety concerns or a lack of staff.</p>
<p>Detroit City Council allowed the city to speed up its permit application process for outdoor dining. The logic behind increasing outdoor dining during COVID-19 is that the extra tables could help restaurants make up for revenue losses when they reopen at half of indoor capacity, per state-level restrictions to curb the coronavirus spread. Of course that depends on weather, demand and other factors.</p>
<p>Duggan said Thursday that the city has issued 56 sidewalk cafe permits since applications opened June 4. It has also approved five street closures: Shelby Street in Capitol Park, the alley in Corktown east of Roosevelt Park by Michigan Avenue and 14th Street, the Gratiot Service Drive in Eastern Market and two sections of Riopelle Street in Eastern Market.

<h3 id="fang-god-hes-alright-patrick-the-snake-found-in-church-grounds-in-derry">&ldquo;Fang God he’s alright&hellip; Patrick the snake found in church grounds in Derry&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.derryjournal.com/webimg/TUFZMTIzNzQyODg1.jpg" alt="img">
Clergy and housekeeping staff at St Columb’s Church in the Chapel Road area of the Waterside were stunned after local parishioners spotted the black and red ringed reptile in the grounds of the Waterside church on Thursday.</p>
<p>After police were contacted, officers immediately got in touch with Derry woman Niamh McManus, founder of Foyle Wildlife Rescue, and together with volunteer Gemma Havlin from Greencastle she swept into action.</p>
<p>And for Niamh it was a case of déjà vu, as police had twice before in 2019 contacted her following sightings of the same snake (which is relatively harmless to humans) in the walled area behind Spencer Road, but the slithery customer had always managed to evade detection - until now.</p>
<p>Patrick the snake after he was removed from the grounds of St Columb&rsquo;s Church in the Waterside.</p>
<p>Niamh told the Journal: “When we got the call from police to say there’s a snake in the church grounds I looked and Gemma and said ‘no way’. I asked if the snake was red and black stripes and they said it was so I knew then. I just started laughing, thinking, ‘this can’t be real’.</p>
<p>“Police tasked me to it in February 2019 and in August 2019 but I could never catch it. For two or three days I pursued it in August and before that I’d been on it’s tail. It has been living inside these Derry walls for at least a year and half. I’m amazed it survived the winter but it managed to keep itself alive.</p>
<p>“It really shows the effects of global warming - if we are having snakes over wintering in Derry then the climate is changing and temperatures are rising. With different species there have been changes, and even migration patterns are being affected.”</p>
<p>By sheer coincidence Niamh had met with a woman who put in the original call about the snake and she was reminding her about it. Lo and behold, two days later Patrick rocks up again in the same area.</p>
<p>The hole were Patrick was found off the Chapel Road.</p>
<p>Niamh and Gemma jumped in the car and made their way to the church, where, said Father Michael Canny from the Waterside parish, those gathered had gently poked the snake to make sure it was real, and were stunned when it slithered off down a gap between the tarmac and the kerb.</p>
<p>After checking out the scene and confirming with the priest and the others that a picture Niamh had of Patrick from last year matched, Niamh and Gemma went back to get equipment before returning.</p>
<p>Gemma Havlin said: “It was unbelievable it survived. Obviously it somehow kept its core temperature. We were trying to figure out how we would catch it. We had a wee rabbit that had passed away and we thought we could set a trap and we went back to the church. Niamh started digging down with her hands and then we were both digging. Niamh managed to reach in and bring it out with her hands. The priest was so, so happy.</p>
<p>“One thing we didn’t bring with us was a pillow case and Niamh had the snake and was calling for one so the priest went in and got a pillow case from the parochial house.</p>
<p>Patrick the Snake is currently being cared for by Foyle Wildlife.</p>
<p>“It was brilliant how well everything worked and we had a hot water bottle for him to keep him warm.</p>
<p>“The snake even got a little blessing and was wished well before we left! He is Patrick forever more Amen after that.”</p>
<p>Niamh added: “It took us ten minutes, and whenever I got the snake out the church bells started tolling. We were in absolute stitches.”</p>
<p>On returning to the rescue sanctuary, Niamh prepared a nice bath and a hot pad for Patrick and they went straight to Pets and Home to get him some proper food.</p>
<p>And all are in agreement that the milk snake’s appearance on Irish soil may have had something to do with events this year and a certain patron saint, who legend has it, banished snakes from this land for eternity. As Fr Canny put it: “Maybe the snakes were back because St Patrick’s Day services and events were cancelled this year, who knows!”</p>
<p>Niamh’s charity Foyle Wildlife Rescue has been meticulously caring for numerous injured or orphaned young animals and has recently been caring for young fox cubs, a pregnant badger and a vast array of other animals including many different young birds. Some of the recent residents have included Conan the Barbarian, a particularly noisy bird, and Pricky Gervais the hedgehog, as well as Brock the Badger, and fox cubs Cinder and Amber. Many have been successfully and very carefully reintroduced to the wild whenever they were ready.</p>
<p>And while Patrick’s days on the mean streets of Derry have come to an end, a suitable forever sanctuary for him will now be sourced for whenever he is ready.
