<p>More than 50 people showed up for a peaceful gathering in front of the Waxahachie courthouse Thursday afternoon in unity against racism.</p>
<p>Community member Betty Coleman started the meeting with a few words. &ldquo;We’re calling this today, ‘Community change day’,&rdquo; Coleman stated. &ldquo;What we’re leaning towards is solidarity in the community. And we’re gonna continue to have these until they are no longer necessary, and I don’t see that happening anytime in the real immediate future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coleman then passed the microphone to Jacob McDaniel, who read a poem to the group, reiterating the words, &ldquo;Why do you hate me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to fight for the change that we want,&rdquo; Coleman continued. As she said the words, &ldquo;No justice,&rdquo; the crowd replied with &ldquo;No peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, Rickey Shorter, one of the scheduled speakers, took the mic. &ldquo;I was born in the early ‘60s. The movement had pretty much just started. Dr. King had just passed away. Growing up in the ‘70s, you were taught to not start trouble,&rdquo; Shorter shared. &ldquo;I never thought that I would live to see the day where I would have to explain to my 7-year-old grandson, when he watched the video [of George Floyd] the other day, of how a person could get treated like an animal and beg for his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shorter said he did not want to tell his grandson the reasoning behind Floyd’s murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear brings on hate, cause when you fear something you want to hate on it,&rdquo; Shorter said. &ldquo;But I’m telling you now, you don’t have to hate on me because I’m black. I can truly say I see color, but color don’t matter. All lives matter but right now, black lives matter. You are not getting killed because of the color of your skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another community member, Rashad Mahdi, read the monologue of George Floyd’s last words, which was eight minutes and 46 seconds. He asked each member of the group to lay down, with their hands on their back for the time being.</p>
<p>The floor was then opened up for community members to share with the group.</p>
<p>Kelly Blackburn quickly informed the group on voting and how to register for the elections coming up.</p>
<p>Valerie Lane, a Waxahachie resident and principal in Keller ISD shared her heart with the group. &ldquo;Why is this important to me? Because I see kids everyday. It’s about educating not just the kids that I serve, as well as the community that I serve. Black lives are on fire,&rdquo; Lane exclaimed. &ldquo;All lives matter, yes they do, but we’re the ones that are on fire, and we need to make sure that we stand up. This is not a black and white issue, this is a right and wrong issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lane then challenged the crowd to speak to family and friends on the current issues of racism occurring, even if they do not agree.</p>
<p>The Waxahachie Police Department was present, some listening as the meeting was held. Assistant Chief Dale Sigler was seen participating in the chants and speaking with attendees.</p>
<p>The gathering ended with a short protest around the courthouse, as people held their signs up.</p>
<p>Waxahachie resident Alan Fox shared his reason for attending the protest. &ldquo;Because it’s time. I grew up in the civil rights era, and it’s like what was fought for many years ago seems to be forgotten,&rdquo; said Fox. &quot; It’s time to make the dream come true once and for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, Carolyn Robinson says that George Floyd’s murder pushed her to attend. &ldquo;Well I don’t like what happened with George Floyd. It wasn’t right. So I don’t want, when I get old, one of my nieces or nephews to ask me ‘Aunty what did you do when it happened?’,&rdquo; Robinson said. &ldquo;I wanna know that I did go out and protest, that I didn’t just stay home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robinson is hoping this protest will bring a step toward equality for the black community.

<h3 id="spike-lee-race-relations-today-are-the-direct-result-of-having-a-black-president">&ldquo;Spike Lee: &lsquo;Race relations today are the direct result of having a black president&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f55f36260de089929e1b3fa2ea11851c18b6a4e/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.png?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=d8e70620ca97956fbec4c685e09ac4bc" alt="img">
For more than three decades, Spike Lee has been one of the most vital forces in film-making.</p>
<p>His latest movie, Da 5 Bloods – about four African American veterans who return to Vietnam in search of the remains of their squad leader – is described by Peter Bradshaw as “a blast of satire and emotional agony about … the fact that black deaths matter”.</p>
<p>Last week, Lee released a new short film that spliced footage from his classic 1989 movie Do the Right Thing with the arrests of George Floyd and Eric Garner, both of which led to their deaths – proof that, even after three decades in the business, his work remains relevant.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the director, 63, spoke to the Guardian over video chat from his office in Brooklyn, New York. He was ebullient as he answered questions sent in by readers and famous fans, often prefacing his responses to his peers with enthusiastic expressions of respect and affection.</p>
<p>David Oyelowo</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>You’ve always set an example of being outspoken about the things that matter to you in the film industry and beyond. Do you feel you’ve ever been penalised for that?</p>
<p>What’s up, David! Yeah, but when you speak truth to power there’s going to be resistance. You know that going in. Whatever they’ve dished out has not stopped me from what I’ve wanted to do for the past four decades. Thank you for the question.</p>
<p>Do you ever get tired of people asking you your views on race relations in the US?</p>
<p>Yes. I don’t mind being asked; it’s how I’m asked. Many times, reporters are working on the assumption I’m speaking on behalf of 40 million African Americans. Which is not the case at all.</p>
<p>Halle Berry</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>What is the most challenging part of working with actors?</p>
<p>They start acting crazy. Hahaha! I love you, Halle, love you, love you. Jungle Fever was Halle’s first film!</p>

<p>If you could describe yourself in five words, what would they be?</p>
<p>That’s very hard. I can’t do it. Now, my wife could, but not me. What would she say? I don’t wanna know. No – I do know, I just don’t wanna hear it! Hahaha! No – I know, I just don’t wanna hear it again! Hahaha!</p>
<p>Lina Wertmüller</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>Reality sometimes overcomes fantasy and the pandemic is a perfect example. Do you think future movies will be able to ignore an event of this magnitude, or will their authors be forced to deal with it?</p>
<p>Lina, I love you, I love you, I love you. Be safe, because I wanna see you and give you a big hug when we get over this thing. I think artists are gonna respond in many different ways to this pandemic. Movies, documentaries, novels, paintings, photographs, books: there’s gonna be great art coming out of this. And historians many years from now will specifically go to see how artists commented.</p>
<p>Where would you be if you weren’t in the US?</p>
<p>If I couldn’t live in America, I would live in the People’s Republic of Brooklyn. Hahaha!</p>
<p>David Lammy</p>
<p>MP for Tottenham</p>
<p>When I watch the protests in the US, the sense I get is one of overwhelming tiredness. Tired of being shot in the street. Tired of waiting for progress. Tired of the never-ending struggle. How do you cope with weariness when injustice never sleeps? And what is the role of art in keeping us awake?</p>
<p>David, that’s a great question. I was very impressed when I met you more than once in London. You’re doing a great job, you’re fighting the good fight. You know the answer. The struggle continues and you just gotta keep fighting. So keep fighting!</p>

<p>Given slavery was the norm in all human civilisation until the 19th century, why do you think the US in particular struggles to deal with the consequences?</p>
<p>Let me answer this question with a question for this person they can’t answer right now. What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I’m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it’s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!</p>
<p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it’s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike – that’s how America dominates.</p>
<p>George Miller</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?</p>
<p>First of all, I gotta give love! My man’s not only a doctor, he’s a film-maker! That’s the only time I’ve heard that combination; for me that’s like two sides of the brain. But I gotta say, love your films, love your films, love your films and one day I hope to meet you in person.</p>
<p>This may sound like a trite answer, my brother Dr George Miller, but storytelling is just part of being a human being. It’s what we do, from the very beginning, when we were writing shit on caves and whatnot. That’s how we communicate.</p>
<p>What moment or moments of all those you put on the screen most surprised you with its cultural impact?</p>
<p>Do the Right Thing. People still going back to that film, especially today. How can you look at the NYPD’s murder of Radio Raheem without thinking about Eric Garner and now Mr Floyd? It came out 31 years ago.</p>
<p>Michael Mann</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>I’m curious – since directors have no idea how any other director directs, because we’re never there – when you’re in that intense groove during weeks, months of shooting, what do you do to maintain your vision for your film off the set? Do you prep, defocus to clear your head for the next day’s possibilities, socialise, stay isolated and meditative?</p>
<p>Michael Mann! Thank you for your question. Big fan of your work. It depends on the film, the scene, how I’m feeling that day. How the actors might be feeling, hahaha! You know what I mean! You know what I’m talking about! You just gotta go with the flow and the vibrations. You know better than me, Michael: this whole thing’s about vibrations that we give back and forth.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Denzel Washington in Malcolm X. Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</p>
<p>How did you get Nelson Mandela involved in Malcolm X?</p>
<p>I knew people that were close to Mandela and while we were shooting in Cairo we made arrangements to go to Soweto to film him. One of the greatest experiences ever. His only feature film is Malcolm X!</p>
<p>Francis Ford Coppola</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>I feel the most effective way to bring about change to the key areas of criminal justice, health care, education equality and childcare/nutrition is by allocating enormous funds; do you agree?</p>
<p>That’s the director of Apocalypse Now, which has two homages in Da 5 Bloods. And the Godfather trilogy. I’m not gonna disagree. And his wine is great, too. That’s my brother.</p>
<p>You strongly supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020: are you going to vote for Joe Biden?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Kamasi Washington</p>
<p>Musician</p>
<p>Nina Simone said that it is an artist’s duty to reflect the times. For the first time, it feels as though people of all races from all over the world have seen the light and are demanding an end to this evil. What role do artists and the arts in general play in this unique time, where we have the world’s attention and true change seems like it might be in our grasp?</p>
<p>Thank you for your questions. I think the role that artists take is the role they choose. All art is not the same and many artists refrain from politics in their work and feel it’s their job to entertain. This is something I’ve learned as I’ve got older: it is an artist’s individual choice to do what they want to do. Any artist who says they’re not going to comment? That’s their choice.</p>
<p>John Turturro</p>
<p>Actor and director</p>
<p>You have given voice to so many issues over the years that haven’t gone away; how do you feel about where we are and are you hopeful for the future?</p>
<p>John and I go way, way back. Our first film together was Do the Right Thing. John is one of the most beautiful, sincere human beings I’ve ever met in my life. I love John. That’s my guy. You know, a lot of the time, shit’s fucked up, but you just gotta fight the good fight. You know that better than me, John.</p>

<p>Ken Loach</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>The long and terrible exploitation of black people lies at the heart of continuing brutal racism, not only in the US, but here as well. Christopher Logue wrote this in his poem Know Thy Enemy: “He does not care what colour you are / Provided you work for him.” How do we unite people of all races to know their real enemy?</p>
<p>Ken Loach?! The heavyweights! Ken, my brother, I’m honoured. Ken, as you know, you are one of the great film-makers. So thank you for taking time out. I wanna meet you. Everybody who’s asked me questions who I’ve never met before: when this thing is over, I wanna sit down with you guys and talk and vibe. We don’t have to talk about cinema; we can talk about football.</p>
<p>But Ken, this is a great question. You gotta hold the mirror up. They gotta see what they look like, what they sound like and the hate they’re representing.</p>
<p>Why did eight years of Obama fail to make substantial enough change to race relations in the US?</p>
<p>Very good question. But you have to understand: race relations – which have gotten worse – are a direct response to having a black president.</p>
<p>Has anything fundamentally changed for the good since 1965?</p>
<p>That’s a hard question. We just buried King George Floyd.</p>
<p>Did you think race would still be such an issue in the US when you made Do the Right Thing?</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tommy Davidson (left) and Savion Glover in Bamboozled. Photograph: Imagenet</p>
<p>Yes, but I never imagined this. What’s made it worse for me is the cameraphones. Before, you just read articles about it. Now, you are seeing these horrific murders. That makes all the difference in the world. The image of King George Floyd being suffocated for the last eight and a half minutes of his life went global and that is why we’ve had marches globally. People round the world saw a human being with this cop’s knee pressed against our brother’s neck, crying out for his deceased mother. You know what? As he was dying, I believe he saw his mother. His mother came to him in his last breaths.</p>
<p>That image hit people’s hearts all round the world and that’s why people took to the streets in England. Get a globe, spin it and, wherever you stop, there’s a good chance people were marching.</p>
<p>We need a new Do The Right Thing now.</p>
<p>No. As long as I’m alive, there will be no remake and, if they try, I’m coming back from the dead to stop it. Hahaha! I promise you, I will come back from the pearly gates, from the upper room, to stop a remake. So help me God. I will bring him with me, and Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Bill Nunn, Frank Sinatra. Anybody that’s passed; we’ll all come back to stop a remake.</p>
<p>Marlon James</p>
<p>Novelist</p>
<p>Bamboozled didn’t just stun critics, it stumped them, like Sly Stone’s There’s A Riot Goin’ On, or Kara Walker’s work. Like those pieces of black art, they couldn’t quite figure it out, because there was no spot in there for them to feel comfortable critiquing it. So, too many just attacked it with this “you’ve made the wrong kind of black art” response. At least, that’s my take. Why do you think the same white critics (and a few black ones) who praised Do The Right Thing were outright dismayed by (in my opinion) one of your best films?</p>
<p>I guess they felt guilty watching it. They might have felt they were being targeted by Spike Lee. They weren’t – unless they were running around with blackface at a very young age. Which is what’s now coming out: all these politicians in the US who are blacked-up in college photos.</p>
<p>Would you consider doing a British-set film with British actors? Especially as the US and UK share many similar racial politics issues.</p>
<p>Yes, I have worked with several Brits. Clive Owen! Chiwetel [Ejiofor]! Great actors. I would have no opposition to doing that. But the only thing I’ve ever shot in London was a Jaguar commercial.</p>
<p>Which of your films are you most disappointed by in terms of their critical and commercial reception?</p>
<p>People missed Bamboozled. 25th Hour. Miracle at St Anna. The biggest one is Chi-Raq. I think that film is gonna find an audience who’ll understand what I was doing 20 years from now.</p>
<p>Rosario Dawson</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>If you could go forward or backward in time to witness a historic or personal event, what would you want to see or experience first-hand, and why?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I have to give my love to Rosario. The first time I saw her was in Larry Clark’s Kids and I’ve been very lucky to have her in two of my films: She Got Game and 25th Hour.</p>
<p>Rosario, I love you, I love you, I love you. That’s a really good question. I would have liked to have been at Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech in Washington DC in 1964. I was alive; I was seven years old. To have heard those words with my own ears …</p>

<p>Paul Schrader</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>Would you cast an implausible person of colour in a historical drama for the sake of diversity, eg casting a black soldier in Custer’s seventh cavalry? What were your feelings about Ryan Murphy’s alternative history Hollywood, which placed persons of colour, gay people and women in positions of power they never achieved? When I cast two black actors and a white actor as best-friend factory workers in Blue Collar, I knew it was an unlikely pairing, but not implausible – therefore worth doing.</p>
<p>Oooh! My brother! Hollywood: I’ve yet to see it, but I’m gonna check it out.</p>
<p>Were there no black soldiers in Custer’s seventh cavalry? Also – and I love Paul; that’s my brother – I would do that film, but Custer would not be the hero. He would be the villain and I would tell it from the viewpoint of the Native Americans. One day!</p>
<p>Does the recent win for Green Book, and that for Driving Miss Daisy 30 years ago, reflect the inability of the liberal, white US to confront the seriousness of racism in the US?</p>
<p>I’m gonna pass on that question. It does me no good to talk – especially in this time we’re living in – about stuff which is insignificant. People are dying every day.</p>
<p>Idris Elba</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>Do you think Michael Jordan will ever let anyone make a movie about his life and times … and would you do it? I ask while shaving my head …</p>
<p>Hahaha! You’re a great actor, but I don’t know if you could handle “the rock”, my man. Two separate skills. You can’t do Mike on the court without some special effects from ILM. I don’t think he’s gonna allow anybody to play him in a narrative film while he’s alive – and he might put that in his will, too.</p>
<p>I love you, Idris. I wanna commend my brother for telling the world that he tested positive [for coronavirus] and telling the world that this thing is no joke. It was so important. There were some crazy ghetto rumours that black people could not be affected by – as we call it – That 19. You did a great service to squash that lie. People might have died or not proceeded with care because they thought their black skin made them immune.</p>
<p>Jackson, Tyson, Jordan: which Michael has been the greatest influence on you?</p>
<p>I’ve worked with all three and all three I consider good friends. I’ve been blessed.</p>
<p>Did you ever have political conversations with Michael Jackson? Was he knowledgeable and engaged about such things beyond a surface level?</p>
<p>Oh, Michael knew what was going on! Look at that film we made in Brazil: They Don’t Care About Us. It was an anthem when he was alive; it’s even more of one now. We had some deep conversations. He was very aware. All you have to do is listen to the music and read the lyrics. As a grown man, he’s not talking about ABC. He’s saying whole different stuff.</p>
<p>Asif Kapadia</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>When did you first decide to cross from fiction to nonfiction? Why?</p>
<p>For me, it all falls under the umbrella of storytelling. Love your documentaries, Asif, keep doing your thing.</p>
<p>Jim Jarmusch</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>I realise this is very general, but I’m wondering: why are movies such a powerful and magical form of expression for you?</p>
<p>I love Jim. We were at NY grad school at the same time. He was three years ahead; for my class – which included Ernest Dickinson and Ang Lee – he’s our hero, because with Stranger than Paradise he provided a blueprint of how we could crack into this industry. Jim was living proof it could be done.</p>
<p>Floella Benjamin</p>
<p>Presenter and politician</p>
<p>I strongly believe that prejudice is learned from an early age and that childhood lasts a lifetime. So, do you agree in order for children to grow up with empathy, more films should be made, specifically aimed at children, that address critical life issues such as racism – and would you consider making one?</p>
<p>I agree 100%. No embryo is racist. No human being that’s being formed in their mother’s stomach is full of hatred. The moment that child pops out – excuse the terminology, I’ve been there with two of my own children and they just popped out, hahaha! – they learn from their parents the good and the bad. Racism and hatred is learned; you’re not born with it. So, I agree. Let’s start teaching our children peace and love at a very early age.</p>
<p>Which actor from the past would you have liked to direct the most?</p>
<p>I would have loved to work with Paul Newman. And Marlon Brando. I’m sorry I never had a chance to work with Sidney Poitier. I did work with Harry Belafonte. I would have loved to work with Dorothy Dandridge.</p>
<p>Why do so many white people teach their children to fear black people?</p>
<p>Ignorance. Guilt.</p>
<p>You’ve created balanced, compelling and humane white characters in many of your films. Why do many similarly talented white film-makers not create compelling black characters?</p>
<p>They probably didn’t grow up around black people. Also: the minorities know more about the majority and it’s not vice-versa because we’re swamped by the majority culture.</p>
<p>Mike Leigh</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>Occasionally, I get mistaken for you; have you been mistaken for me?</p>
<p>What’s up, Mike, my brother! I haven’t had the honour yet! Peace and love.</p>

IBM’s stock price slumped this week after the company announced it would get out of the facial recognition business for fear that it could lead to racist, abusive surveillance. So what do we make of that? We’ll talk about this disconnect between our national moment of racial reckoning and Wall Street on today’s Whadda Ya Wanna Know Wednesday.</p>
<p>Here’s links to some of what we’re talking about today:

<h3 id="sea-girls-release-video-for-do-you-really-wanna-know">&ldquo;Sea Girls Release Video For &lsquo;Do You Really Wanna Know?'&rdquo;</h3>

The UK&rsquo;s Sea Girls take you into their surreal world as they reveal the fun-fuelled animated video for their latest single &ldquo;Do You Really Wanna Know?,&rdquo; taken from their forthcoming debut album Open Up Your Head - out August 14 via Island Records.</p>
<p>The video, directed by world class animator Francesca de Bassa, takes the band&rsquo;s own self isolated photography and brings them to life as kaleidoscopic, animated collages. What starts as an empty canvas soon turns into an absurd world swarming with anthropomorphic characters - a colourful and playful live concert of moving images where the lines between reality and fantasy blur.</p>
<p>Francesca recently created a captivating film on mental health awareness, which, in line with the personal lyrical themes of the song and topics that the band have discussed openly, made her the perfect fit to bring the subject matter to life.</p>
<p>Watch &ldquo;Do You Really Wanna Know?&rdquo; below!</p>
<p>As with previous Sea Girls&rsquo; singles, &ldquo;Do You Really Wanna Know?&rdquo; first premiered as Annie Mac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hottest Record&rdquo; on BBC Radio 1 and stateside Wolf In A Suit said &ldquo;the guys keep on showcasing the extent of their talent as they deliver catchy and inviting verses that people can instantly connect with.&rdquo; Ear To The Ground labeled it &ldquo;Refreshingly nostalgic.&rdquo; The track exemplifies the band&rsquo;s penchant for penning emotionally charged, deeply personal, hook laden guitar-pop brilliance.</p>
<p>With Open Up Your Head, Sea Girls&rsquo; songwriting has elevated, with frontman Henry Camamile stepping into the spotlight as a genuine storyteller for his generation. The album is fit to burst with colourful melodies, guitar and synth hooks - an explosion of joyous indie rock held together to reflect Camamile&rsquo;s darker songwriting that becomes one of hope.</p>
<p>Taking their inspiration as kids, when The Killers, The Strokes and Arctic Monkeys debut albums were released, much of their success is driven by their energetic live performances and uncanny ability to write adrenaline-heavy guitar anthems with songs like &lsquo;Violet&rsquo; and &lsquo;All I Want To Hear You Say&rsquo;, and the release of their latest EP Under Exit Lights.</p>
<p>The band have also been keeping busy in lockdown, releasing isolation &lsquo;Living Room&rsquo; live performances and becoming the first band to host Netflix Parties with their fans.</p>
<p>Renowned for their frenetic, sweat-drenched performances, 2019 saw Sea Girls playing their debut live shows in the U.S. to packed rooms in both New York City and Los Angeles. While stateside the band headed to Paste&rsquo;s NYC studio for a session. The band will kick off their rescheduled April (UK) dates by upgrading the venues to play their biggest headline shows to date in November 2020, including a career defining night at London&rsquo;s legendary O2 Brixton Academy on November 6. Tickets are on-sale at <a href="https://www.seagirls.net/uk-tour">https://www.seagirls.net/uk-tour</a></p>

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-968710336.jpg" alt="img">
The news this week of entertainer Kelly Clarkson filing for divorce from her husband of seven years, Brandon Blackstock, came as an absolute shock to her fans.</p>
<p>Kelly Clarkson and husband, Brandon Blackstock | Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘The Voice’: Nick Jonas Talks About Priyanka Chopra After Kelly Clarkson Says She’s a Decade Older Than Him</p>
<p>The couple seemed perfectly happy in recent weeks filming her daytime talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, at their ranch in Montana alongside their children.</p>
<p>Clarkson’s words to her younger self, which she shared earlier this year, are even more meaningful now after the sad news of the end of her marriage.</p>
<p>Clarkson was just joking 6 months ago about the couple’s active sex life</p>
<p>In 2019, Clarkson chatted on her daytime show with 2018 The Voice winner Brynn Cartelli during the digital segment, “Ask Me Anything.” Each one got to ask the other, well, anything.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old singing competition winner innocently asked Clarkson about her pre-bedtime routine each night. It made for an awkward exchange between the two.</p>

<p>“What is the last thing you do before you go to bed every night?” Cartelli asked the “Catch My Breath” singer. “Is there one thing?”</p>
<p>Clarkson was caught off guard and hemmed and hawwed before getting honest. Cartelli, unsure if she wanted to proceed, said, giggling, “Oh, no. Do I not wanna know this?”</p>
<p>“Well, Brynn,” the Stronger singer began as Cartelli laughed, “I was single for many years so, I have children [now], and how one makes children is generally what I do before bed — that’s not a lie. That’s real! And it’s not weird, it’s natural.”</p>
<p>The couple met through Clarkson’s agent and has two children</p>
<p>The Kelly Clarkson Show host met her husband through her manager, Narvel Blackstock, now her father-in-law. Brandon and Kelly knew one another but sparks flew between them when they met again at the Super Bowl in 2012.</p>
<p>Clarkson was very familiar with Brandon Blackstock’s family, not only through his father/her manager, but also through her husband’s stepmother, the legendary performer Reba McEntire, who is a dear friend of Clarkson’s.</p>
<p>RELATED: Kelly Clarkson Eats This Each Day To Maintain Her Almost 40-Pound Weight Loss</p>
<p>“Brandon is my manager’s son. I’ve known him for six years but he was married for most of that time,” she told The Daily Mail in 2012. “Then, suddenly, there he was at the Super Bowl and he was single…”</p>
<p>In four years, the couple’s married life was a whirlwind of activity.</p>
<p>They connected in January 2012 and by December of that year were engaged. In October 2013, the couple wed and then welcomed their first child, River Rose, in June 2014. Two years later, their family grew with the birth of their son, Remington Alexander.</p>
<p>Now, eight years after their romantic first moment, the couple looks as though it is done, with Clarkson filing for divorce from her husband.</p>
<p>Her advice to her younger self earlier this year</p>
<p>In January 2020, Clarkson was asked by InStyle about the advice she would give her younger self, knowing what she knows now.</p>
<p>If anything, her words take on weightier meaning considering that she has filed for divorce from her husband of seven years.</p>
<p>The singer touched on a life lesson that has stayed with her: that one simply can’t change or rescue another person, and that they and they alone are responsible for their own actions. In light of her divorce filing, it sounds like a message to someone she knows.</p>
<p>“I would tell my younger self to stop trying to save or fix people,” she revealed. “I spent a solid portion of my life trying to justify others’ actions, and it was exhausting to say the least. People have to help themselves. I am not that powerful. No one is.”</p>
<p>It will have to be seen if the couple goes through with the divorce and if a prenuptial agreement was in place at the time of their wedding.</p>
