<p>No significant change in activity has occurred during the past days.PHIVOLCS recorded 1 volcano-tectonic earthquake and continuing emissions of gas and steam plumes. The plumes were dispersed towards the northwest, west-northwest and west-southwest direction.Constant glow is visible from the summit crater.Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions reached to a 324 tonnes/day.Recent electronic tilt data showed inflation of the middle to upper portions of the volcanic edifice that began in the last quarter of 2019.The warning bulletin states that ballistic impacts of volcanic bombs, pyroclastic and lava flows could affect an area of about 6 km distance from the crater and 7 km on the SSW and ENE flank.

<p><img src="https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/598dba29cb97012b008b4b66-2000/rts10y24.jpg" alt="img">
Reuters / Antonio Parrinello</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank this week published a somewhat bizarre research note speculating on a series of potentially catastrophic events it says could befall the global economy in the next decade.</p>
<p>The bank said in a note Tuesday that there is a 33% chance at least one of four scenarios will occur in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>These are: A far more deadly pandemic than COVID-19, a volcanic eruption, a solar flare and global war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important question is what would happen if a much larger, more catastrophic eruption occurred,&rdquo; analysts from the bank asked.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has been pretty much the only story in town for global markets and the world economy in 2020, but Deutsche Bank thinks there is a 33% chance of at least one of four much bigger risks, including a &ldquo;globally catastrophic&rdquo; volcanic eruption taking place over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>In an unconventional note Tuesday, the German bank said: &ldquo;We find there is a one-in-three chance that at least one of four major tail risks will occur within the next decade: a major influenza pandemic killing more than 2 million people; a globally catastrophic volcanic eruption; a major solar flare; or a global war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said this assumes a:</p>
<p>2% annual probability of a flu pandemic killing 2.2 million people.</p>
<p>0.15% chance of a VEI-7 — the highest level volcanic activity — eruption taking place.</p>
<p>1.06% chance of a solar flare — which would disrupt global communications.</p>
<p>0.625% chance of a global war.</p>
<p>Below are Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s four possible scenarios, and how they might hurt the global economy:</p>
<p>A bigger pandemic than COVID-19</p>
<p>Reuters</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank noted that while COVID-19 has had an enormous impact, it has still been less disastrous than other major pandemics such as the Spanish flu in 1918, the Black Death in the 14th century, the Plague of Justinian of the sixth century, and a smallpox outbreak in Japan that began in 735.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said: &ldquo;Before Covid-19 occurred, Madhav et al. (2017) estimated there was an annual probability of 2 per cent that an influenza pandemic will cause 2.2 million pneumonia and influenza deaths or more globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given that Covid-19 has led to a severe recessions and lockdowns in numerous countries, an even more serious pandemic could be even more catastrophic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A VEI-7 volcanic eruption would cause major disruption</p>
<p>The German lender said one of the biggest risks to global stability comes from volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider that the relatively remote Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland shut down nearly all of European airspace in 2010, leading to extensive economic disruption. And further back in 1991, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines was so large it actually led to a reduction in global temperatures over the subsequent two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So an important question is what would happen if a much larger, more catastrophic eruption occurred, and how likely is this to happen,&rdquo; Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>The bank&rsquo;s projections are based on a VEI-7 volcano, the highest level on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, which &ldquo;would cause major disruption on a global scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last time the earth experienced a VEI-7 eruption was in 1815 in Indonesia, when Mount Tambora erupted. That eruption was so devastating that it reduced global temperatures and led 1816 to be dubbed the &ldquo;Year without a summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gigantic solar flare</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank said the the next risk comes &ldquo;from millions of miles away&rdquo; — from the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A severe solar storm can cause substantial and long-standing damage here on Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A similar event occurring today would be far more disruptive given that modern technology is based on electronics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There could be major power outages as electrical power grids are disrupted, which in turn would have knock-on effects throughout the economy as critical infrastructure is unable to be run properly,&rdquo; the bank noted.</p>
<p>Outbreak of a war or an accident with a nuclear weapon</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank said countries are less likely to go to war than they did in previous decades but nonetheless it still sees this as a risk to global stability.</p>
<p>The bank said it is &ldquo;more difficult to place a probability on the outbreak of war&rdquo; as it includes human calculations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, if we made the conservative assumption that the annual probability of a global war is 0.625% (i.e. a 1 in 160 chance each year), then that means there&rsquo;s a 22 per cent chance that one will take place within the next 40 years,&rdquo; Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>Tensions have flared in recent days between India and China, with some already speculating that the fighting on the two countries&rsquo; Himalayan border could be a catalyst for a major conflict.</p>
<p>Biggest risks possibly beyond this lifetime</p>
<p>Chase Stone</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s research went beyond the decade and possibly even this life-time through a set of extreme &ldquo;possibilities we&rsquo;re unlikely to see in our lifetimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One possible extreme tail risk is a VEI-8 volcanic eruption, which would be much more severe than the VEI-7 cases discussed earlier. One example of this is the eruption of Mount Toba around 75,000 years ago,&rdquo; Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>The bank said another possibility is an asteroid strike which most notably occured around 66 million years ago and led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs and a host of other life on earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this may seem implausible, smaller instances have happened in recorded history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bank concludes: &ldquo;Tail risks that can cause these changes are more common than many realise and it is more likely than not that the coming decades will see another with consequences at least as severe as those caused by COVID-19.&rdquo;

<h3 id="philippines-taal-volcano-shows-increased-activity-amid-covid-19-outbreak-will-it-erupt-soon">&ldquo;Philippines&rsquo; Taal Volcano Shows Increased Activity Amid COVID-19 Outbreak; Will it Erupt Soon?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://data.ibtimes.sg/en/full/32054/taal-volcano-philippines.jpg" alt="img">
While the country is currently dealing with an outbreak caused by COVID-19, the Taal volcano in the Philippines has once again displayed signs of increased activity. According to a local agency, several volcanic earthquakes have been recorded from Taal in the past couple of days.</p>
<p>Taal&rsquo;s volcanic activity is currently being monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). Due to the volcano&rsquo;s current activities, its status remains at Alert Level 1.</p>
<p>Increased Volcanic Activity</p>
<p>As indicated in PHIVOLCS&rsquo; latest report, 3 volcanic earthquakes were reported in Taal on June 11. The agency explained that the earthquakes were associated with the rock-fracturing process happening around and beneath the volcano&rsquo;s edifice. The agency also detected weak plumes of steam coming from the vents on Taal&rsquo;s main crater.</p>
<p>PHIVOLCS detected the same level of activity from Taal during the past couple of days. Compared to its status in May, the volcano&rsquo;s activities have decreased this past week. Last month, an average of 10 volcanic earthquakes were detected from Taal daily.</p>
<p>Taal Volcano&rsquo;s Current Status</p>
<p>According to PHIVOLCS, Taal&rsquo;s status is currently at Alert Level 1. Although this status indicates that an eruption is not imminent, the agency warned entering the established danger zones around the volcano is still prohibited. PHIVOLCS also noted that local officials in the area should still continue to monitor the current status of the volcano in preparation for an emergency situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are also advised to observe precautions due to ground displacement across fissures, possible ashfall, and minor earthquakes,&rdquo; PHIVOLCS stated. &ldquo;Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from sudden explosions and wind-remobilized ash may pose hazards to aircraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taal&rsquo;s Previous Eruption</p>
<p>The Taal volcano&rsquo;s last major eruption occurred in January of this year. The powerful eruption occurred after months of increased activity that began in March of 2019. Back then, the status of the volcano was at Alert Level 1.</p>
<p>Due to the possibility of a volcanic tsunami and the magnitude of the eruption, which covered areas surrounding the volcano in ash, the volcano&rsquo;s status was raised to Alert Level 4.

<p>Due to all the chaos of evacuating after the eruption of Taal Volcano in the Philippines in January 2020, it completely slipped my mind that we had to take part in S.U.P.E.R Training.</p>
<p>S.U.P.E.R. Training stands for: “Spiritual Unity &amp; Physical Endurance Reinforcement.” The annual training for the missionaries emphasizes the importance of teamwork, partnership, intimacy with God, patience, a never-give-up attitude and the spirit of obedience.</p>
<p>I had heard so many horrendous rumors about S.U.P.E.R Training, which is why I really wanted to avoid this activity at all cost. However, the day came when we had to pack our things for this three-day trip.</p>
<p>We had to drive for two hours and then walk for an hour in order to reach our destination. We walked in a long, single-file line and endured the strong waves of heat that gleamed on our faces. When we arrived, we were all excited to see the clear blue beach that seemed to welcome us. However, our happiness and excitement did not last long. We immediately set our things down and started our training.</p>
<p>We were taught ten different physical training exercises. At first, it wasn’t so bad; it was actually pretty fun. However, after 50 minutes of continuous exercise, we were exhausted. We wanted to take a break and drink water, yet there was no stopping till we finished going through all ten physical training exercises. The problem was, after 50 minutes, we were still stuck on physical training exercise #1. We had been told to leave our watches and our caps on campus, so we didn’t know how much time passed while the sun scorched as hot as ever onto our faces. It felt like an eternity, finishing that session.</p>
<p>When lunch time finally arrived, we all groaned in pain and exhaustion. We all stuffed our faces with as much food as we could. After eating, we wanted to be done for the day. We did not want to do anything; however, we knew that this was just the beginning. We continued our training after an hour of break. For four hours, we consistently had our physical training exercises in the scorching sun with only a quick five-minute break in the middle. More times than I can count I wanted to cry and give up. My whole body was giving up on me, and I just wanted to stop and hide in the shade.</p>
<p>By the second hour, I actually felt my soul leaving my body. I felt like an empty shell, exercising mindlessly. When I was told to run, I ran. When I was told to lie in the water, I laid down. When I was told to crawl in the hot sand, I crawled. When I was told to do jumping jacks a hundred times, I did it. However, when my mind told me to run away, I could not. Why is that? It is because I was not alone. The hardest thing about the whole training was hearing the groans of my fellow trainees. When I was exhausted and in pain, I was not alone. I could not complain because I knew that others were experiencing the same thing. Even when they made mistakes and we had to receive more punishment, we could not groan because groaning made things worse. That day, we had to learn to accept the mistakes of others. Even when they kept messing up.</p>
<p>Pastor Jun, the director of the program, made it very clear to us that day that loving others is difficult; however, we must endure and understand them because that is what Jesus did. Jesus never complained. In the scorching sun, Jesus was crucified on the cross yet he never complained. Though his disciples all ran away from him, Jesus did not utter a word. Jesus never gave up no matter how difficult the situation may have seemed. Through this S.U.P.E.R Training, I’ve learned to accept the mistakes of others without questioning. I’ve also learned that I should not give up; instead, I should depend on the Lord for help. It was a long three days that we all had to bear; however, through this torturous experience, we all grew a bit more mature in the presence of Christ. I am glad that I was able to complete this training; nevertheless, it is an experience that I never want to repeat again.</p>

<h3 id="dutertes-anti-terror-bill-is-another-nail-in-the-coffin-of-the-philippines-waning-democracy">&ldquo;Duterte’s anti-terror bill is another nail in the coffin of the Philippines’ waning democracy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7BFP2TFGNQI6VCMOWINZVA7XSI.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
The timing of the bill has left human rights groups nothing short of skeptical. As the nation continues to struggle through the government’s awful response to the covid-19 pandemic, what does such a law hope to accomplish?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>If enacted, the bill will ease the legal restrictions on law enforcement in defining who is a terrorist and what rights these “terrorists” have under the law. In particular, it allows the warrantless arrest and detainment of those the government-appointed Anti-Terror Council deems “suspicious.” Suspicious activities could range from attempting to damage government property to simply criticizing the administration online. It also allows for the secret surveillance and wiretapping of “suspected” criminals. According to the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, the bill’s loose definition of terrorism allows the government to essentially tag any and all dissenters as terrorists without any judicial oversight.</p>
<p>The bill is yet another example of how the government has attempted to respond to a national crisis in a highly militarized, macho-populist fashion. Last year, Philippines’ Congress — filled with Duterte’s allies — cut 4 billion pesos (more than $80 million) from the nation’s calamity fund; since 2016, when Duterte came to power, it has cut 22.9 billion pesos (nearly $460 million) from the fund. When the Taal volcano erupted in January, rather than accept responsibility for the government’s lackadaisical approach to providing relief, Duterte instead cursed the volcano and threatened to “pee on Taal” to extinguish it. Just a few weeks later, as the nation braced itself for the covid-19 pandemic, Duterte unconvincingly proclaimed that he was looking for the “idiot” coronavirus because he wanted to slap it.</p>
<p>It is clear that Duterte’s traditional playbook of intimidating his opponents in public and overwhelming public dissent with his online troll army on social media is not effective under the stay-at-home reality that covid-19 has forcibly thrust onto the world. No amount of fraudulent accounts spewing misinformation can reconcile the government’s covid-19 response with the fact that many of the nation’s most destitute are being left behind.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>As he often does, Duterte has once again played the blame game, asserting that the Philippines’ failure to contain the pandemic rests on irresponsible lockdown violations by an undisciplined and hardheaded populace. But this narrative of “us vs. them,” wherein the president places the responsibility of his administration’s failures on everyone and everything except himself, is collapsing under the current existential health crisis.</p>
<p>This might explain why Duterte has suddenly called for the swift approval of the “urgent” anti-terrorism bill. Unable to control the narrative as the nation’s poorest starve, Duterte is instead diverting attention by attempting to put a muzzle on the opposition. In May, Philippine media network ABS-CBN was forced off the air, a move that media watchdogs saw as one of Duterte’s many attempts to silence independent press. The proposed anti-terrorism bill is yet another nail in the coffin of the Philippines’ waning democracy.</p>
<p>Duterte’s push for the bill goes beyond just being a mismanaged set of priorities from the administration. His administration is knowingly exploiting the suffering of the Filipino populace in the midst of a global pandemic. It is not attempting to protect the Philippines from a potential terrorist threat, but rather supplying itself with the unchecked power to arrest and detain dissenters. Philippine democracy itself is on the verge of collapse.</p>

<h3 id="america-should-stop-defending-the-philippines-like-it-was-a-vital-interest">&ldquo;America Should Stop Defending the Philippines Like It Was a Vital Interest&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/default-social-images/cato-commentary.jpg?itok=Y4RL8F2l" alt="img">
The Civil War awakened the latent American military giant. As the 20th Century approached American presumptions and ambitions burgeoned. Business imagined profiting from the supposedly illimitable markets of Asia. The Philippines was an obvious way station toward the commercial conquest of China, which attracted American attention even then. Indiana Sen. Albert Beveridge was one of the most persistent apostles of imperialism. In a speech entitled “The March of the Flag” he denounced those who opposed seizing Pacific territories: “Hawaii and the Philippines not contiguous! The oceans make them contiguous.”</p>
<p>The sensationalist Yellow Press, most dramatically Joseph Pulitzer, whose name adorns today’s most prestigious journalistic award, and William Randolph Hearst, helped turn this vision into a military reality. They were early creators and propagators of “fake news,” demonizing admittedly harsh Spanish rule in Spain. Indefatigable imperialist and racist Theodore Roosevelt, who served as assistant secretary of the navy, pushed America toward the conflict. In 1898 Congress declared war on Madrid in the name of liberating the Cuban people.</p>
<p>However, the imperialist lobby saw the Philippines as within America’s grasp as well. Spain’s forces there were quickly defeated, but the Filipinos, already organized and fighting for their freedom, refused to accept new colonial masters from America. Washington was determined to rule, leading to three years of increasingly bitter irregular combat. US soldiers compared the campaign to fighting, and often exterminating, American Indians. The military was unable to hide its manifold war crimes as 200,000 or more Filipino civilians died. In some majority‐​Muslim territories, such as on Mindanao, opposition never fully disappeared‐​and fighting continues today.</p>
<p>The US finally granted the Philippines independence in 1946, after its liberation from wartime Japanese occupation. The country suffered through poverty, inefficiency, and corruption. Incompetent democracy gave way to dictatorship which eventually shifted back to a succession of ineffective democratic governments. Through it all the US was committed to protect the Philippines by the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. However, that commitment faded once America lost Clark Airfield and Subic Bay, returned in 1991 and 1992, respectively. A volcano ruined the former while domestic political opposition closed the latter.</p>
<p>Military relations revived with the 1998 negotiation of a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) that enabled US personnel to visit and act in the Philippines. In 2002 the US sent special operations forces to advise the Philippine military in combat operations against Islamist insurgents. In 2003 the US labeled Manila a major non‐​NATO ally, a comical honorific given the state of the Filipino military. Over the years the US participated in military exercises with and provided arms and training to Filipino forces.</p>
<p>In 2014 the two governments penned the Agreement on Enhanced Defense Cooperation. The pact provided for the transfer of military equipment and provision of financial grants. However, the Obama administration pushed for more, sending surveillance aircraft through Filipino airspace, initiating military exercises, and adding other military activities. “The US and Philippine governments have always found ways to liberally interpret the provisions of the existing agreements,” opined security consultant Jose Antonio Custodio, who accused Washington of “an obvious bending” of the agreement.</p>
<p>The Obama administration also continued to affirm the misnamed “mutual” (Manila’s sole apparent role was to be helpless) defense pact. Alas, the result could be war with China at Manila’s behest. The Philippine government is ever ready to borrow the US military to confront the PRC in their multiple territorial disputes.</p>
<p>The best publicized controversy is Scarborough Shoal (Panatag Shoal to Filipinos and Huangyan Dao to Chinese), a roughly 60‐​square‐​mile group of rocks and reefs, worthless except for the water and resource authority that goes with territorial control. It was administered by the Philippines until 2012, when the PRC sent naval vessels to oust Filipino fishing ships. America’s sensible refusal to intervene then led to the charge of being an “unreliable ally”-from a country unwilling to invest in a military capable of defending its claims. (Also at issue is the appropriately named Mischief Reef, occupied by China in 1995. China has augmented the atoll, within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone, with an artificial island and airfield.)</p>
<p>Bilateral relations became less stable after Duterte, who makes Trump look civil and rational, assumed the Philippine presidency in June 2016. Relations with the US immediately tanked. The Obama administration criticized his lawless violence against drug users and sellers; he responded by calling President Barack Obama “a son of a whore.” Duterte, probably the most overtly anti‐​American president ever elected in the Philippines, criticized US military operations alongside the Filipino military in Mindanao and harkened back to America’s initial, murderous counterinsurgency campaign against the indigenous independence movement.</p>
<p>Duterte briefly declared his nation’s “separation” from America and proclaimed himself an acolyte of Xi Jinping, visiting China in search of investment dollars. However, most Filipinos, especially those in the country’s security establishment, strongly favored the US and remained highly suspicious of Beijing. And Duterte returned from China with little more than empty promises. The People’s Republic of China would have liked to pull Manila away from America but the PRC would not accept the Philippines’ territorial claims, even rejecting a ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in Manila’s favor. China continued to occupy Scarborough Shoal, giving the Duterte government little in return.</p>
<p>Although his Chinese gambit failed, Duterte’s relationship with the US even after Obama’s departure varied from uncomfortable to hostile. That did not stop the Trump administration from embracing Manila, however, promising to “back the Philippines” against China in any naval confrontation.</p>
<p>Indeed, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appears to be permanently at odds with the president’s occasional desire to disentangle the US from potential foreign conflicts, announced: “Any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea will trigger mutual defense obligations.” Pompeo was responding to Philippines Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana who, concerned about Washington’s sometimes ambiguous pronouncements on its view of Filipino disputed territories, demanded clarification. Indeed, Lorenzana threatened to terminate the bilateral defense relationship unless Washington affirmed its willingness to send Americans to defend, and perhaps die in the process, Filipino land of no importance to the US</p>
<p>The right response would have been to tell Lorenzana to go pound sand. Instead, Pompeo made America look like the supplicant. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin, Jr. affected generosity in accepting America’s word. He said he interpreted US policy as “we have your back.”</p>
<p>That was then, however. In February the old Duterte was back, complaining that Americans were rude and took their weapons home after they visited. But what most bothered Duterte was Washington’s revocation of a visa for Ronald dela Rosa, who served as police chief under the Filipino president and was responsible for the murder of drug dealers and users. Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo pointed to “a series of legislative and executive actions by the US government that bordered on assaulting our sovereignty and disrespecting our judicial system.”</p>
<p>So Duterte announced the end of the VFA, which governed US military personnel on the islands and working with the Filipino military. The pact would expire six months hence, after which Americans would be sent home and future military cooperation would be limited. Any future event or activity would require individual negotiation over the terms of America’s presence.</p>
<p>The defense treaty would remain formally in force, but Washington would not likely rush troops where they are not welcome. Warned the RAND Corporation’s Derek Grossman: “By not having the ability for US troops to move freely into the Philippines, to operate there and to move military equipment into the Philippines makes it much more difficult for the US to make good on its obligations under the mutual defense treaty.” Filipino Senator Panfilo Lacson predicted that killing the VFA would reduce the defense agreement “to a mere paper treaty as far as the US is concerned.”</p>
<p>What of the Chinese who the Philippine president no longer seemed so eager to engage? “They do not mean harm,” he announced, as long as “we do not also do something that is harmful to them.” As for America, Duterte insisted that he would neither “entertain any initiative coming from the US government to salvage” the VFA nor accept a summit invitation from Trump‐​which had not been extended.</p>
<p>Four months on, however, Locsin said that all was forgotten if not forgiven “in light of political and other developments in the region.” Probably meaning that China’s XI did not offer boatloads of cash to buttress the weak Philippines economy. Duterte suspended his notification for six months, halting the pact’s expiration. If he gets irritated again, he could allow the countdown to proceed. Alas, Washington maintains its supplicant attitude. Said the embassy in Manila: “Our longstanding alliance has benefited both countries, and we look forward to continued close security and defense cooperation with the Philippines.” It would have been hard to genuflect much lower to Duterte.</p>
<p>Why should the US make military guarantees to such a nation and government?</p>
<p>There always have been costs and risks to the commitment, but they were modest in the past. The dangers have risen dramatically as China’s government, under XI Jinping, has become more aggressive and the Philippines government, under Duterte, has become more erratic. Last June, a Chinese naval ship hit and sank a Filipino fishing boat: China said the waters were territorial seas while the Philippines claimed the area was its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Perhaps recognizing his military weakness‐​the navy’s flagship is an American Coast Guard cast‐​off constructed decades ago‐​Duterte uncharacteristically leveled with his people: “A shooting war is a grief and misery multiplier. War leaves widows and orphans in its wake. I am not ready or inclined to accept the occurrence of more destruction, more widows and more orphans should war‐​even at a limited scale‐​break out.”</p>
<p>Alas, he could only contain his bluster so long. He soon called on Washington to launch a crusade against the PRC: “I’m calling now, America. I am invoking the RP-US pact, and I would like America to gather their Seventh Fleet in front of China. I’m asking them now.” Perhaps he recently watched the movie Dr. Strangelove since he appeared to channel Maj. T.J. Kong, ready to sit atop an American bomb on its way down onto the Chinese aggressors: “When they enter the South China Sea, I will enter. I will ride with the American who goes there first. Then I will tell the Americans, ‘Okay, let’s bomb everything’.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, the US rejected Duterte’s invitation to war, despite Pompeo’s ill‐​considered promises. But serious risks remain. American Ambassador Sung Kim later said that the defense treaty covered “any armed attack,” including by any “government‐​sanctioned Chinese militia,” even in disputed areas. The good news is that the defense pact does not itself trigger war. Rather, Washington promised to “meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes,” meaning with a congressional declaration of war. Alas, recent presidents have tended to dispense with such legal niceties.</p>
<p>The time for such one‐​sided “mutual” defense treaties has passed. The original security guarantee for the Philippines reflected fear of a Japanese military revival‐​which Manila now desires‐​and the emergence of the Soviet Union as a global threat. However, Russia has essentially written off Asia and especially the Pacific militarily. Today it is the People’s Republic of China which worries the US and China’s neighbors, including the Philippines. At least sometimes, anyway, depending on Duterte’s mood.</p>
<p>However, Beijing is a dubious substitute threat for the U.S.S.R. The former is ideologically bankrupt, more fascist than communist. Its military ambitions are regional rather than global and pose no direct threat to the US, whether the latter’s people, territory, or liberties. China is determined to confront Washington’s seeming assumption that the Monroe Doctrine applies to Asia and America is entitled to intervene militarily against China in the latter’s neighborhood. No doubt it is convenient for the US to treat the Asia‐​Pacific as an American sphere of interest, but over the long‐​term that policy is unsustainable at any reasonable cost, given how much more it costs to project power than to deter intervention.</p>
<p>What if China’s increased assertiveness becomes dangerously aggressive? The PRC’s territorial ambitions so far seem concentrated on areas that are historically or plausibly Chinese‐​Hong Kong and Taiwan most obviously, as well as nearby islands. There is no indication of plans to conquer neighboring lands to create a vast, new, and expanded empire. Even without American involvement such regional hegemony would be difficult for Beijing, which is surrounded by nations with which it has been at war during that last 75 years: India, Japan, Korea, Russia, and Vietnam. Other important states also hope to limit Chinese influence, such as Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.</p>
<p>Manila may be weaker than the others, but the Philippine people always resisted foreign occupiers, including Americans, Japanese, and Spaniards. Filipinos should make clear that they would meet any threat from China with similar vigor. Moreover, the Philippine government should expand defense ties with nearby states.</p>
<p>For instance, Manila took an important step forward in recent years by encouraging Tokyo’s growing role. India also is playing a larger naval role in Southeast Asia and nearby waters. Indonesia and Vietnam are confronting similarly expansive Chinese territorial claims. Canberra has taken a sharper tone toward Beijing of late, targeting the PRC’s attempt to influence domestic Australian politics and criticizing Beijing’s role in spreading the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In extremis, Washington could backstop the Philippines’ survival, which is not threatened and is not likely to come under attack. However, the archipelago is of little security significance to America. Washington desires to have bases everywhere, but Manila is unlikely to allow the US to use Filipino territory against Beijing unless the Philippines is under threat. Even a Philippine president better disposed toward America than Duterte would not want to make his nation into a permanent enemy of China.</p>
<p>The US might prefer that Manila rather than Beijing control fisheries and energy deposits, but that is only a peripheral interest. More important is America’s commitment to navigational freedom. However, the Philippines plays only a modest role in that regard. As a practical matter, the PRC isn’t likely to interfere with navigation in peacetime, irrespective of sovereignty claims. In wartime all that would matter is naval superiority, which would be difficult for America to maintain so close to the Chinese mainland. The Pentagon is spending heavily to counter China’s growing anti‐​access/​area‐​denial capabilities, but Beijing will always have the advantage in the Asia‐​Pacific.</p>
<p>The Philippines is a dubious partner. The US should stop treating allies like Facebook Friends, collecting as many as possibility irrespective of their relevance or value. The Duterte presidency is the perfect opportunity to start treating the Philippines like a mature state capable of protecting itself. After all, as Duterte’s office explained when justifying his decision to end the VFA, he “believes that our country cannot forever rely on other countries for the defense of the state.” America should adopt the same position.</p>
<p>Trump seems to understand. He is ordering home some US troops from Germany and might do the same in Korea. Asked about Duterte’s original decision, Trump answered: “I really don’t mind, if they would like to do that, that’s fine.” After all, he noted: “We’ll save a lot of money.” Even more important, the US might save lives as well.</p>
<p>The US should give Manila notice that it is time to renegotiate the defense treaty into a looser pact allowing military cooperation when in both nations’ interests. No more faux mutuality with America expected to automatically defend the Philippines, including all its disputed territories, and against China. Let Filipinos upgrade their military, develop regional allies, and accept responsibility for their own future.
