<p>Actor Shardul Pandit , who was in the news for talking about depression, lack of work and financial crunch, which forced him to move bag and baggage to his hometown, Indore, in July, is back in the city. The ‘Bandini’ actor has been signed as one of the participants in the 14th edition of ‘Bigg Boss’.We hear that he was also offered a pivotal role in ‘ Kundali Bhagya ’, but the actor had to turn it down owing to his mother’s health woes. However, things have fallen into place now and he reached Mumbai a few days ago to be quarantined before he enters the house.Despite repeated attempts, Shardul remained unavailable for comment.Some of the names that are confirmed to be seen in this season are Jasmin Bhasin , Jaan Kumar Sanu (singer Kumar Sanu’s son), Pavitra Punia, Punjabi singer Sara Gurpal, Nishant Malkani, Eijaz Khan and Rahul Vaidya. We have now learnt that a celebrity couple has been finalised to participate in this season. Rubina Dilaik , who was last seen in ‘Shakti — Astitva Ki Ehsaas Ki’, will be joined by her husband, Abhinav Shukla , on the reality show.Not new to the non-fiction genre, Abhinav had participated in the first season of ‘Survivor India’ in 2012. He was also seen in ‘Khatra Khatra Khatra’ in 2019. His last fiction outing was ‘Silsila Badalte Rishton Ka’. Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t reach Abhinav for comment.

<p>Along with this Nora Fatehi and Guru Randhawa will enter the present to amp up the enjoyable vibes among the many contestants. Nora will ask all of the male contestants to carry out hook steps from her music ‘Garmi’. Tomorrow’s episode will likely be a fun-overloaded curler coaster experience.
