<p>Swedish YouTuber star PewDiePie aka Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg is one of the most subscribed YouTubers out there. He recently came in support of fellow YouTuber Jenna Marbles, who has decided to quit the platform due to blackface controversy.</p>
<p>In a message on his YouTube channel, PewDiePie wrote that Jenna was &ldquo;one of the most genuinely good people” on YouTube and she had to quit due to &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;.</p>
<p>PewDiePie added that Jenna had moved on from the platform for &ldquo;mistakes that happened 8-10 years ago&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jenna had taken part in a blackface skit in 2011 where she had apparently shamed women and had performed a racist rap. This video had resurfaced online some time back with netizens calling for action.</p>
<p>As an answer to the backlash, Jenna had uploaded a final YouTube video announcing that she would be leaving the video-sharing site. In the 11-minute-long video, Jenna said she wanted to be accountable about her actions and hence was taking some time off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m ashamed of things I’ve done and said in my past - but, it’s important,&rdquo; she said adding, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m just going to move on from this channel for now. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s forever. I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s going to be&hellip; I&rsquo;m just going to stop for now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Swedish star said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These actions reflect in no way who she is and the content she makes today, anyone who watches her can see that. Some things were more leviant [sic] a few years ago — that’s not to say it was right, but where the line is drawn from the past and today seems non existent. I thought the point was to learn from your mistakes and do better? We all have problems in our past, no one in the world is perfect&rdquo;.

<h3 id="youtube-personality-pewdiepie-believes-colleague-jenna-marbles-got-bullied-off-the-site">&ldquo;YouTube personality PewDiePie believes colleague Jenna Marbles got &lsquo;bullied off the site&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/28/06/30139892-0-image-a-39_1593323095110.jpg" alt="img">
Earlier this week, Jenna Marbles, 33, announced to her over 20million subscribers on YouTube that she was quitting the platform amid blackface backlash.</p>
<p>And fellow YouTube star PewDiePie, 30, came to her defense in a statement published to his YouTube channel on Friday.</p>
<p>PewDiePie - born Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg - described Jenna as &lsquo;one of the most genuinely good people on this platform&rsquo; and found it disgraceful that she got &lsquo;bullied off the site by mistakes that happened 8-10 years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who cares? These actions reflect in no way who she is and the content she makes today, anyone who watches her can see that,&rsquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Defense: Fellow YouTube star PewDiePie, 30, came to Jenna Marbles defense in a statement published to his YouTube channel on Friday</p>
<p>Marbles uploaded a video titled &lsquo;A Message&rsquo; on Thursday, where she addressed her highly criticized past transgressions, which included a 2011 blackface skit, shaming women and a racist rap.</p>
<p>PewDiePie continued: &lsquo;Some things were more [lenient] a few years ago - that&rsquo;s not to say it was right, but where the line is drawn from the past and today seems non existent.</p>
<p>He took major issue with online &lsquo;cancel culture&rsquo; and urged people to allowed others to &lsquo;learn from [their] mistakes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought the point was to learn from your mistakes and do better? We all have problems in our past, no one in the world is perfect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>PewDiePie fears that YouTube &lsquo;will be filled with nothing but douchetubers who don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; if content creators like Marbles &lsquo;who do [care]&rsquo; get &lsquo;pushed out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taking issue: PewDiePie - born Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg - described Jenna as &lsquo;one of the most genuinely good people on this platform&rsquo; and found it disgraceful that she got &lsquo;bullied off the site by mistakes that happened 8-10 years ago&rsquo;; PewDiePie pictured in 2015</p>
<p>A Message: Earlier this week, Jenna, 33, announced to her over 20million subscribers on YouTube that she was quitting the platform amid blackface backlash</p>
<p>&lsquo;So disappointed with the internet and how far things have gotten. And of course these are the headlines as well,&rsquo; concluded the social media sensation, who included a screenshot of various news headlines pertaining to Marbles.</p>
<p>PewDiePie - who boasts 105million subscribers on YouTube - faced backlash of his own in 2017 for dropping the N-word during a video game livestream.</p>
<p>In Jenna&rsquo;s 11-minute video she began by stating that she &lsquo;can&rsquo;t exist on [her] channel&rsquo; and that she wants to &lsquo;hold [herself] accountable, and it’s painful to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I’m ashamed of things I’ve done and said in my past - but, it’s important.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I&rsquo;m just going to move on from this channel for now. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s forever. I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s going to be&hellip; I&rsquo;m just going to stop for now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marbles said it was time to take a step back from the channel amid a pileup of questions about the routines.</p>
<p>The latest: Jenna Marbles, 33, says she will no longer post to her YouTube channel amid scrutiny of older videos she did that contained racist content including a blackface skit</p>
<p>In an 11-minute clip titled &lsquo;A Message,&rsquo; the Rochester, New York native, 33, acknowledged her past transgressions, which included a 2011 blackface skit (pictured), shaming women and a racist rap</p>
<p>She specifically addressed the blackface skit, a video featuring a rap which made a joke about Asian people, and another in which she hit out at women who &lsquo;slept around&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The rap song included the line: &lsquo;Hey Ching Chong Wing Wong, shake your King Kong ding dong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She described the video as &lsquo;awful&rsquo; and &lsquo;inexcusable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the blackface video she dons a pink wig and skintight blue outfit and jokes that Minaj has different personalities. At one point in the video she is seen with dark paint or a face mask on her face while talking about &lsquo;kinky&rsquo; sex.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I get it,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve definitely done things in the past that weren&rsquo;t great. I&rsquo;m not completely unproblematic. I&rsquo;ve tried my best to grow up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marbles is seen wearing a shiny skin-tight outfit and a pink wig during her Nicki Minaj impersonation</p>
<p>Admitting wrongdoing: Marbles acknowledged she had past done a skit in blackface trying to lampoon Nicki Minaj</p>
<p>Marbles, whose real name is Jenna Nicole Mourey, admits she&rsquo;s gradually switched the older clips to private amid &lsquo;a time where we are purging ourselves of anything and everything toxic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yeah there [are] things in my past I&rsquo;m not proud of and I&rsquo;m getting a lot of tweets from people saying, &ldquo;Why have you privated all these old videos?&rdquo; and I have spent a lot of the last few days privating almost all of my old content.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if any of that holds any nostalgia for you but I&rsquo;m literally not trying to put out negative things into the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marbles said she was &lsquo;unbelievably sorry&rsquo; specifically in regards to the blackface skit, and wishes &lsquo;it wasn’t part of [her] past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She added of the bit: &lsquo;I do just want to tell you that it was not my intention to do blackface.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how else to say this but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because all that matters is that people were offended and it hurt them&hellip; this isn&rsquo;t okay and it hasn&rsquo;t existed on the Internet for a long time because it&rsquo;s not okay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Purge: Marbles, whose real name is Jenna Nicole Mourey, admits she&rsquo;s gradually switched the older clips to private amid &lsquo;a time where we are purging ourselves of anything and everything toxic&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for her other offensive content, Marbles said &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t need to exist&rsquo; and she was &lsquo;embarrassed that [she] ever made&rsquo; it.</p>
<p>Marbles said she saw no value in leaving the offensive content up, as she doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;want to contribute to&rsquo; strife amid a time where racism is at the forefront of the national discussion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the case where people will watch something and be offended now, I don&rsquo;t want it to exist,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;So I probably deleted a lot of my old content because I just don&rsquo;t want anyone to feel upset about anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marbles said she had no problem taking the heat for her past transgressions to align with the social values she and her fans hold dear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m happy to do that,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;because what I want from the people that I support and that I like is to have accountability and to know that I am supporting someone whose morals and values align with my own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marbles said that while she cannot erase the past, she can be her best self moving forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As someone clearly with their own past that they&rsquo;re not proud of, I do just try to see people for who they are right now, today and that they&rsquo;re not defined by their pasts - and I understand,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to do the same thing that you are and support and be friends of people that I&rsquo;m proud of and that I love and I just know that I&rsquo;m doing my best.&rsquo;

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>When a viewer asked him if he had ever considered retiring from YouTube, the Swedish star revealed that he thought about it a lot in 2019, however the vacation he took in January 2020 helped him figure things out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did more last year, but after my break it kind of gave me some time to understand, which part of it I enjoy, and that I just want to focus on that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to even be making videos now. So anything is a bonus, I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The star opened up some more about his vacation, and said that he was seriously considering taking another month off in January 2021. &ldquo;I might do the January meme again, honestly I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it. It was really nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Prior to last year, PewDiePie had never taken a break, consistently uploading videos seven days a week for nearly a decade. His time off marked the first time he had truly stepped away from his channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like it&rsquo;s fair. Any other job you get like holidays, and I don&rsquo;t really do that. And this year has been especially kind of crazy. So yeah, I&rsquo;ll probably do that in January to be honest It was good for my mental health,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old also explained that despite enjoying what he does, he doesn&rsquo;t want his whole life to pass him by doing the same thing. He then joked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting old guys, I&rsquo;m 30! &ldquo;I did not expect me to sit here 10 years later, no f**king way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feuds PewDiePie wants you to forget</p>
<p>PewDiePie is one of the biggest success stories on the internet, breaking multiple YouTube records. Since his rise to fame, he has built a following of adoring fans and is a highly recognizable figure in the gaming and content creation industry. However, he has come under much greater scrutiny as his fame and wealth have grown. This increased profile has also led to several feuds developing over the years between himself and others in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>Sometimes PewDiePie seems to get a kick out of embellishing these little battles for the sake of entertainment. After all, he&rsquo;s known for his over the top sense of humor and willingness to speak his mind. However, it does appear that there are a few of these fights that he&rsquo;d rather not revisit. A few of these have been because the issues seemed to run their course. There have been a few instances, however, in which it seemed as though a situation got a little bit out of hand and PewDiePie decided to put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some feuds that PewDiePie wants people to forget.

<h3 id="the-real-reason-pewdiepie-rarely-collaborates">&ldquo;The real reason PewDiePie rarely collaborates&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img2.svg.com/img/gallery/the-real-reason-pewdiepie-rarely-collaborates/intro-1592332420.jpg" alt="img">
The real reason PewDiePie rarely collaborates</p>
<p>PewDiePie has been increasing his interaction with fans through his latest videos. Along with reacting to memes sent to him from fans, he has also started doing videos where he reads questions from viewers and fields other content submitted by fans. He will also occasionally take feedback from fans in these videos, such as when he recently considered the idea of giving his Minecraft save file to his viewers.</p>
<p>In a recent video, PewDiePie specifically took a look at &ldquo;assumptions&rdquo; that people have made about him, fans or otherwise. One of these assumptions opened up an interesting insight into how PewDiePie goes about working on projects with other people. This person wrote, &ldquo;You really dislike most of YouTube which is why you don&rsquo;t collab with anyone new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PewDiePie insisted this isn&rsquo;t the case, reminding viewers that he has collaborated with James Charles and Ninja. He did, however, explain that collaborations just really weren&rsquo;t his thing overall. Though he ultimately enjoys making them, they come with their own challenges.</p>
<p>Mostly, Pewds explained that he just doesn&rsquo;t like the process of reaching out and getting the ball rolling on a collaboration. He said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s more the fact that I don&rsquo;t like asking people, &lsquo;Hey you wanna collab?&rsquo; &hellip; It feels weird to me. I don&rsquo;t know why. I really hate asking people for stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also explained to his viewers that he is actually quite shy. This comes as a surprise considering what a boisterous personality Pewds usually displays on camera. However, as he said in the video, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shy, but I don&rsquo;t like it &hellip; I try to push myself to not be, but it&rsquo;s really hard &hellip; and it comes across very obvious when I interact with other people online sometimes, and I hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This video also seems to continue a trend of PewDiePie weighing in honestly on his body of work and being upfront with his viewers when they ask questions of him. In another recent upload, he addressed the matter of why he has found himself in so many controversies in the past. He told his viewers, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve always had a very light-hearted take on serious topics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also admitted that this didn&rsquo;t excuse some of his less mature moments. Overall he said, &ldquo;someone that is as popular as I am should have seen [those controversies] coming. It was inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While PewDiePie is by no means leaving his lighthearted persona behind, it does appear as though the YouTube star has taken to unpacking his past. He even seems interested in rehabilitating his public image. It&rsquo;s a good thing, too. After signing a recent exclusivity deal with YouTube, he will likely be seen by more viewers than ever before. It seems as though PewDiePie has been attempting to evolve since he took a break from uploading videos earlier this year. In the months since he came back, he has addressed some other topics that have hounded him in the past, even weighing in on the the presence of misogyny in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Another comment PewDiePie made during this video seemed to really pinpoint why the YouTuber was taking greater care with his image. As he explained in response to one viewer assumption, &ldquo;I think for the first time in a long time, I feel very enthusiastic about the future, my life, and where things are going to go next.&rdquo; In other words, PewDiePie is looking ahead these days.</p>
<p>PewDiePie isn&rsquo;t the first high profile Internet personality to explain why he doesn&rsquo;t collaborate with certain people. In fact, that kind of discourse is exactly what landed Ninja in hot water with many fans a while back. In an interview with Polygon, Ninja said that he chooses not to stream with female gamers because he doesn&rsquo;t want people to get the wrong idea or start gossiping about him. He also says he does this so that nobody makes any assumptions about the relationship he has with his wife. This didn&rsquo;t sit particularly well with many fans and detractors alike, but Ninja has stood by these comments.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s good to know that PewDiePie&rsquo;s lack of major collabs doesn&rsquo;t come from any kind of unseen drama. PewDiePie has had his share of feuds in the past, so it wouldn&rsquo;t have been entirely out of the realm of possibility. At least now his fans know that there&rsquo;s a chance he could work with another YouTuber or content creator in the future. All he has to do is not feel super awkward about it.

The PewDiePie Vs T-Series battle (to amass the highest number of subscribers) is still fresh in our minds and memories. But don’t worry if you’re an exception; you’ll recall it all by the end of this thanks to the recent meme-fest that has taken over Twitter town. Just one look at the micro-blogging platform and you’ll find a bunch of PewDiePie aka YouTuber Felix Kjellberg fans celebrating. No, the creator has not outnumbered T-Series - which still holds the title of the most-subscribed channel - but he surely has earned some chuckles since #UnsubscribeTSeries started trending.</p>

<p>If you need context, it all began when Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam blasted the company and it&rsquo;s head honcho Bhushan Kumar. The artist shared videos on his social media claiming that the music industry, at the behest of a few, runs like a mafia. Nigam also alleged that T-series is trying to mar his reputation. Needless to say, supporters rallied behind him and started the trend, urging all to unsubscribe T-Series. Phir kya? PewDiePie fans in the Twitterverse knew they couldn’t let the chance of redemption slip away and unleashed a meme fest! Check it out here:</p>
