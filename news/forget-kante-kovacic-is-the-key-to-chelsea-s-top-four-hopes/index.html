<p>Forget Kante - Kovacic is the key to Chelsea&rsquo;s top-four hopes</p>
<p>Frank Lampard will be praying that the Croatian&rsquo;s Achilles problem is not too serious as the 25-year-old has been his best player this season</p>
<p>N&rsquo;Golo Kante was the first name on the team sheet for &lsquo;s most recent title winners but now the Blues have a new undroppable player: Mateo Kovacic.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Croatian has grown into the player that many expected him to become from the moment signed the midfielder from in 2013.</p>
<p>After a tough first season on loan from , Kovacic has become Frank Lampard&rsquo;s only untouchable at Chelsea, which only makes the Achilles injury sustained by the 25-year-old in Tuesday&rsquo;s win over all the more concerning.</p>
<p>Kovacic was forced off just three minutes before the break after a collision with Sadio Mane and although the Blues battled their way to a deserved 2-0 victory, losing the midfielder for an extended period of time would be a calamity for Lampard.</p>
<p>The timing certainly couldn&rsquo;t be worse, for both the player and his club.</p>
<p>Kovacic struggled under Maurizio Sarri last term and Chelsea&rsquo;s decision to make his loan deal permanent arguably had more to do with the club&rsquo;s transfer ban than his performances on the field.</p>
<p>The arrival of Lampard, then, was key to Kovacic&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have good communication with him,&rdquo; the international said last week. &ldquo;I am working on my bad sides of my game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am talking to him a lot and I am analysing my game. I think I am becoming a better player but it is normal because I am getting more mature. I am a good age so I feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lampard has certainly been impressed by Kovacic&rsquo;s improvement. Indeed, it was telling that he was the only player singled out for praise by his manager after the chastening 3-0 loss to .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kovacic played with a personality and a quality that makes you go, &lsquo;Okay, he can play in pretty much any team with that level&rsquo;,&rdquo; the Blues boss enthused.</p>
<p>Hardly surprising, then, that Kovacic is firmly in pole position to win Chelsea&rsquo;s Player of the Season awards.</p>
<p>Lampard will, therefore, be mightily concerned by the potential loss of one of his most reliable performers, not least because Chelsea are already short on options in midfield.</p>
<p>Kante will remain sidelined by injury for a further fortnight, while Jorginho is suspended for the next three matches.</p>
<p>The fit-again Ruben Loftus-Cheek racked up 90 minutes for Chelsea&rsquo;s Under-23s in Monday&rsquo;s 1-0 win over , whom the Blues face next in the league before games against and Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Chelsea also have injury issues out wide, with Willian having also limped off against Liverpool. It&rsquo;s not yet known when Christian Pulisic will recover from the muscle problem that has kept him out since New Year&rsquo;s Day and while Callum Hudson-Odoi could return this weekend, the international hasn&rsquo;t trained for a month.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, first-choice striker Tammy Abraham has already missed a month of football with an ankle issue, while a minor knock kept centre-half Andreas Christensen out of the Liverpool game.</p>
<p>Chelsea&rsquo;s injury crisis has arrived at a most inopportune moment, with Lampard&rsquo;s side already struggling to hold on to fourth place in the Premier League.</p>
<p>and Wolves are now only three points further back, while a win for Carlo Ancelotti&rsquo;s on Sunday would put them in contention for a Champions League place despite currently sitting in 11th in the standings.</p>
<p>The Blues, of course, only have themselves to blame in this regard. After a bright start to the season, they have failed to rack up back-to-back wins since November and have been particularly poor at home.</p>
<p>Still, Lampard has been understandably buoyed by the impressive cup win over runaway league leaders Liverpool.</p>
<p>Ross Barkley put in his best performance of the season so far, while 18-year-old Billy Gilmour was the star of the show, walking away with the man-of-the-match award thanks to a midfield masterclass that drew praise from one of the Scot&rsquo;s childhood idols, Cesc Fabregas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been learning off [Kovacic and Jorginho] in training and watching them in games,&rdquo; Gilmour said after the match. &ldquo;To play alongside both of them was brilliant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully, Kova is back and fit for the weekend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That now seems unlikely, with Lampard subsequently admitting that Kovacic&rsquo;s Achilles problem looks &ldquo;worse&rdquo; than Willian&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He will be praying that&rsquo;s not the case, though. Of all the players currently struggling with injuries at Chelsea, Kovacic is the one that Lampard needs back in his starting line-up as soon as possible.
