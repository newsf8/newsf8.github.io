<p>Every drought is different, but when it comes to the current drought conditions across the Murray-Darling Basin, BOM says it is now &ldquo;the most severe in 120 years of records&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Key points: Climatologists say that the Federation drought (1891-1903) and the World War II drought were similar to current conditions</p>
<p>Climatologists say that the Federation drought (1891-1903) and the World War II drought were similar to current conditions Not everywhere across the Murray-Darling is experiencing its record-worst drought conditions</p>
<p>Not everywhere across the Murray-Darling is experiencing its record-worst drought conditions Just to provide relief, not even to break the drought, BOM says some places would need record high rainfall over the next three months</p>
<p>In a presentation on Thursday, climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, Dr David Jones, said that the Federation drought (1891-1903) and the World War II drought were similar to this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general picture across the Murray-Darling Basin, for droughts lasting two to three years, this is the most severe we&rsquo;ve now seen in terms of the rainfall totals and probably also in terms of the general runoff into dams,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The variable nature of droughts makes them hard to compare as everyone experiences drought differently, and not everywhere is currently experiencing its worst drought.</p>
<p>Conditions in the southern basin are significantly less severe than in the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look in southern Victoria, for example, the stand-out drought is clearly still the Millennium drought,&rdquo; Dr Jones said.</p>
<p>Going back further into the paleo record there have been bad droughts, but Dr Jones said you could not really compare those prehistorical droughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly this is about as bad as it has got in our records. It is pretty severe,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Over the last two years rainfall has been below average for much of the country. ( Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology )</p>
<p>What is making this drought so bad?</p>
<p>Dr Jones outlined three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Warm conditions in the far Indian and Pacific Oceans resulting in reduced rainfall 2. Underlying reduction in southern wet season rainfall 3. Underlying temperature increase</li>
</ol>
<p>Both the Pacific and Indian Oceans have been unhelpful to our rainfall, according to Dr Jones.</p>
<p>These climate drivers are not the only way for drought to come to Australia, but they are commonly associated. They can also work to complement or counteract each other. ( ABC Weather: Kate Doyle )</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we haven&rsquo;t quite hit the mark for an El Nino declaration we&rsquo;ve been very close, and we have been very close for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian Ocean continues to be so, we are currently on the verge of a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, southern cool season rainfall has been declining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly there is significant variability in our climate system but it does appear, as we might have expected, that cool season drying in southern Australia is probably exacerbating the drought in some areas,&rdquo; Dr Jones said.</p>
<p>This excerpt from the State of the Climate Report 2018 shows winter rainfall over southern Australia has been declining over the past 20 years. ( Supplied: CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology )</p>
<p>On top of that, it has been hot.</p>
<p>Due to climate change, mean temperatures in Australia have gone up by just over one degree Celsius since the BOM started keeping records in 1910.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means this drought is a bit different. What we&rsquo;ve seen in the past doesn&rsquo;t necessarily apply to droughts in the present,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Increased temperatures can increase evaporation, drying out soils.</p>
<p>Plus it can mean livestock need more water to keep cool, further exacerbating water storage issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also know high temperatures add to the drought stress. Plants, for example, if it&rsquo;s dry it&rsquo;s bad. If it&rsquo;s hot and dry it&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>How much rain will it take to break this drought?</p>
<p>If you are looking for a happy ending this would be a good time to go read something else.</p>
<p>To ease the conditions, but not even break the drought, Dr Jones said &ldquo;we need to get, in some places, record high rainfall for the next three months — just to provide some measure of relief&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, for a lot of Australia, in the next three months it&rsquo;s not the time of year that droughts are likely to break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loading&hellip;</p>
<p>The current outlook is not good. There will still likely be rain, but the chance of the heavy, widespread, drought-breaking rain in the next three months is slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the spring tends to be quite dry,&rdquo; Dr Jones said.

<h3 id="nsw-drought-farmers-succession-planning-and-this-years-harvest">&ldquo;NSW drought: Farmers&rsquo; succession planning and this year&rsquo;s harvest&rdquo;</h3>

news, local-news,</p>
<p>WITH cash at a premium and farmers overseeing dry pastures, many are taking the opportunity the drought to take stock and evaluate their properties&rsquo; future. James Hamilton of Collective Advisory has been working as an facilitator with families on succession planning and said the number of inquiries had risen in the past six months. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very serious question - it&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s careers at stake,&rdquo; he said. READ ALSO: Media unites to fight fed government censorship &ldquo;The younger generation is saying, &lsquo;we need to have this conversation - I&rsquo;m prepared to be here, but I need to know there&rsquo;s something at the end&rsquo;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s those doing the hard yards during the drought questioning the future, that &lsquo;if I&rsquo;m not going to have the farm in the end, I might as well get out now&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mr Hamilton said children were not asking for their share of their farms &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;, but they wanted certainty. &ldquo;They want to ensure the farm stays within the family,&rdquo; he said. He said families had more choices available to them to keep the farm viable the more time they allowed to plan. Despite state and federal government drought assistance, Mr Hamilton feared what shape town economies would be in once the drought lifted. &ldquo;Some of us have that ability to borrow money, but some of these people who own shops don&rsquo;t and they won&rsquo;t come back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There needs to be a greater conversation about that.&rdquo; In fact, he said programs providing hampers of food could make the situation worse because they did not support local stores and suggested a voucher system where farmers could spend them in town and those stores could then claim the money. READ ALSO: Parliament hack report to stay secret Wellington Shire Council in Victoria&rsquo;s Gippsland region chose to spend its $1 million drought budget on $700 debit cards, which farmers could apply for. The state government has offered a transport subsidy to cover up to 50 per cent of the cost of transporting fodder, water, farm chemicals, fertiliser and seed, stock to and from agistment, and stock to sale or slaughter. Further rebates apply for farms where animal welfare is a concern, while horticulturists can now claim for emergency water infrastructure to keep their trees and vines alive. The state government has also subsidised training courses for farmers to either upskill or move into a different career. THEY might only be a couple of hundred kilometres apart, but the region&rsquo;s farmers and horticulturists are faring vastly differently after another dry winter. Farmers west of Dubbo would normally be looking forward to harvesting their winter crops, but many did not sow this season due to the dry weather. NSW Farmers Narromine and Trangie branch chair James Hamilton, who grows wheat, barley and chickpeas, said he held out until July to see whether rain would come and none did. READ ALSO: Journalistic credentials need to be toughened, Senator Hanson says &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t planted anything this year, which is the first time ever - myself, I&rsquo;ve been here 20 years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to sow dry and hope - last year there was a bit of that and it pays off sometimes.&rdquo; He said he would continue to graze sheep for the time being. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been lambing so once the lambs are big enough, we&rsquo;ll sell the lot if it doesn&rsquo;t rain,&rdquo; he said. Narromine agronomist Ryan Pratten, who has been helping farmers make decisions on planting and management, said the only farmers still sewing across the Macquarie Valley tended to be cotton farmers with access to irrigation, as well as feed crops. He said what winter crops were sown would be harvested within the next week. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably 15 per cent of [the area] we normally harvest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The average yield for us, just the wheat crop, is 2.5 tonnes a hectare - but the average this year will be less than a tonne a hectare. &ldquo;The prices are good, but not exceptional and they&rsquo;re not going to make up for the low yield.&rdquo; READ ALSO: Meals recalled after 15 salmonella reports Meanwhile, the cherry crop in Orange is set to be largely unaffected, provided the weather holds out at harvest time in November and December. Last year, some fruit was lost due to hail storms. Caernarvon orchardist Fiona Hall said she expected a medium to large crop this year, or up to 1500 tonnes, across the Bite Riot Group, which also extends to Mudgee and Griffith. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just gone out of blossom and the fruit set looks good so hopefully there will be no shedding,&rdquo; she said. Mrs Hall said growers had been able to keep their crops irrigated and snowfalls had helped, but dropping dam and bore levels were starting to become a concern. READ ALSO: Spotlight on Morrison&rsquo;s press freedom view &ldquo;We have enough to get us through the cherry season, but the apples might be a challenge,&rdquo; she said. Orange Region Vignerons Association president Nicole Samodol said while there was &ldquo;definitely a need for more rain&rdquo; and growers in Canowindra were struggling, there was still moisture in the soil at the Orange vineyards. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a great start to the bud burst,&rdquo; she said. Last season, vignerons reduced the overall number of buds on the vines to concentrate the quality in the remaining fruit, a strategy Bathurst vigneron Mark Renzaglia intends to employ this season. Last season, his vineyards yielded only a third of the fruit he would expect in a normal year and with limited options for irrigation, particularly at the Mount Panorama vineyard, he hoped the strategy would bring the crop closer to 70 per cent. READ ALSO: Labor questions election year ad spending &ldquo;You really want to give them some water prior to the end of winter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve pruned almost twice as hard as we normally would and we&rsquo;ve left much less buds - if the vine is trying to support more shoots, that can lead to getting less foliage, which is what shades and ripens the fruit.&rdquo; Mr Renzaglia will start harvesting in February, through to April. NSW Farmers Bathurst Branch chair David McKay, who runs cattle, said most farmers in the region were grazing pastures they might normally sow with lucerne and some were making hay. He said his herd was down to 50, mostly breeding stock and the calves he was raising for market. &ldquo;A lot of people have been culling off their sheep - shearing them and then selling them - sheep are good because the wool&rsquo;s worth a bit still,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing better than out west, but we&rsquo;re still on the knife.&rdquo; AS governments hand out money for pipelines and advertise the benefits of Snowy Hydro 2.0, councils remain concerned about the worsening water situation. The drought was at the top of the agenda at last week&rsquo;s Local Government NSW annual conference, with 16 separate motions submitted from across the state. Orange, Cabonne, Parkes and Narromine councils submitted five of them - Orange called the state government to form an emergency plan for the current and plan long term infrastructure, while Cabonne also called for a plan in partnership with the stakeholders in its catchments. READ ALSO: Workers underpaid more than $40 million Parkes called for a taskforce, while Narromine called for an immediate boost to dam storage. The conference delegates passed two overarching motions, which have become Local Goverment NSW&rsquo;s platform - one asked the state and federal governments for more funding to help communities deal with the drought and set extra aside for recovery, through joint organisations. The other asked for an emergency plan, including the flexibility to transfer water without a water allocation and securing town water supplies, plus a 40-year plan for infrastructure ensuring population and economic growth targets could be achieved. READ ALSO: Rapist ex-priest jailed for more abuse The resolution stated strategies &ldquo;should not exclude&rdquo; ambitious projects the size of Snowy Hydro and should include stormwater harvesting, demand management and recycling. Local Government NSW president Linda Scott said it was an emotional issue for the councils who watched their communities struggle. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re desperate to get help,&rdquo; she said.

Logging contractors have gone from next to nix to six-day weeks post-lockdown.</p>
<p>Post Covid-19 lockdown business for forestry companies is growing, but they are not yet out of the woods.</p>
<p>“Things are trucking along quite well,” said Prue Younger, chief executive of the Forest Industry Contractors Association (FICA).</p>
<p>“But the big thing with contractors is that they are at the beck and call of log prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last two weeks they’ve been pretty high but how long that will last we’re unsure because of the Chinese economy and the attitude of other internationals towards imports.”</p>
<p>The pre-Covid competition from a deluge of cheap spruce logs from Europe had abated, she said, as China was being particular about what they let in.</p>

<p>Christel Yardley/Stuff Tokoroa’s Jeanette and Dion Weedon, who Stuff spoke to in March and felt then the industry had never been so low, have noticed the upswing. They are pictured here with daughter Ivy, 3.</p>
<p>China takes around 80 per cent of New Zealand’s log exports.</p>
<p>Certainly Tokoroa’s Jeanette and Dion Weedon, who Stuff spoke to in March and felt then the industry had never been so low, have noticed the upswing.</p>
<p>Jeanette said her husband’s crew had been working six days a week on a block near Rotorua.</p>
<p>In March, he told Stuff in nearly three decades in the industry he had never seen it so hard hit.</p>
<p>“Since going back to work it’s been hard out. There’s been no limit to what they can get out the gate.”</p>
<p>But there had also been some mention to Dion that this level of work might only last a few more weeks.</p>
<p>Consistency was a problem, echoed Younger, who said she had anecdotes of some contractors around the country not starting back or putting crews off.</p>
<p>The possibility that the current boom was just refilling stocks in China, or because other borders were opening, had been further undercut with anxiety around new legislation requiring the registration of log traders and forest advisers.</p>
<p>Chris Marshall/Stuff We&rsquo;re still standing: logging contractors are case-hardened to ups and downs in the industry but this year&rsquo;s lows have challenged some.</p>
<p>“A bit of concern is that it’s going to cost money to manage that registration process. The government can come in and make some hard hitting decisions on log quotas, so it’s an issue with domestic prices and export prices. So there are a few complexities outside of Covid-19.”</p>
<p>She said FICA agreed with the idea of ensuring transparency in the industry “but at what cost does it come and what bureaucratic interventions will it bring?”</p>
<p>Another issue, said Mark Aldridge of Taupō’s Terrain Safety Shop, was transport.</p>
<p>“Since we have come back, logging has been full noise but the long-standing problem of having enough transport to clear the logs has again emerged,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are not enough trucks in the industry and it’s not that well publicised, but we’ve been down 20 per cent on drivers for two years. So the big problem is you can go from zero to hero and maintain safe work practices but clearing the logs is an issue.”</p>
<p>But he felt the prospects for forestry in general were positive — markets, demand and price.</p>
<p>Taupo-Times The ongoing drought in some parts of the country is causing planting contractors pause for thought.</p>
<p>Logging had been directly affected by the crisis from mid January, when Chinese ports shut, until the end of March and from there went into the “brakes-on scenario” of eight weeks of lockdown.</p>
<p>“Many contractors are case-hardened to these things. Logs tend to go through a market correction every seven years so you have some very resilient operators. The positive thing is, apart from a second wave breaking out in China, logging in New Zealand looks pretty promising from here to Christmas.”</p>
<p>The dry weather was something of a cloud on the horizon for those putting trees in however.</p>
<p>Said Aldridge: “Trees can be planted but like all living things they do need moisture.”</p>
<p>Logging crews that spoke to him were happy not having to cope with the wet in the meantime but in some parts of the country, said Younger, conditions were so dry planting crews were waiting for rain and an increase in soil moisture.</p>
<p>“I haven’t heard of too many contractors starting up. Another issue is some are still looking for a workforce. There are high unemployment numbers and they’ll be employing some highly qualified people who might have soft hands.”</p>
<p>Also hindering the usual provision of planting crews was that quite a few would have been relying on seasonal employees from the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Younger recommended it to any Kiwis seeking work. “For six months it&rsquo;s a good outdoor get fit type job.”

<h3 id="life-in-a-ski-town-under-lock-down--whats-it-like">&ldquo;Life In A Ski Town Under Lock Down – What’s It Like?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.mountainwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/79369564_10220345738735815_1253013879194124288_o.jpg" alt="img">
Mountainwatch | Reggae Elliss</p>
<p>Since the resort closures started happening in North America and Europe a few weeks ago, life has been very different for people in ski towns and resorts around the world. Typically, some of the closures coincided with good snowfalls, but while restrictions on skiing and snowboarding are one element, there are a lot of other factors to consider. Mountainwatch spoke to four people living in lockdown in different ski towns around the world about their experiences and thoughts on the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic</p>
<p>Sam Robertson, Verbier, Switzerland</p>
<p>Sam Robertson grew up in Thredbo is a former member of the Australian race team and has been living and working in Stockholm the past few years. A passionate skier, Sam spends as much time as he can in Verbier each winter which where he was when we spoke to him, just coming out of self-isolation after contracting the Covid-19 virus.</p>
<p>You’re in Verbier in with the virus and in lockdown – when did you find out?</p>
<p>About three weeks ago was the best week of the season – we had 50cm+ every two days and it was going off. This obviously attracted a big crew and a lot of friends to Verbier. A couple of days after things settled, some friends of mine tested positive back in Stockholm and also some others in London. We had all been partying together and riding the cable cars like a pack of sardines, so that was a big red flag. All of a sudden a lot of locals started becoming very ill. A couple of days later Televerbier closed the resort and a few days after that I started showing symptoms.</p>
<p>What has it been like and how are you feeling now? What were your symptoms?</p>
<p>For me it was quite mild, but I was lucky. Some friends of mine have been really sick (and some cruised through it). It differed to a regular flu in that: I had some quite intense muscle and joint pain, a dry barky cough and throat, rather than the usual wet runny nose and a fever. Also, some rarer symptoms, a loss of taste and smell and a couple of Bali belly style poo’s (ew). It sounds bad, but overall, I had more energy than the usual knockout you get from the flu.</p>
<p>Are you seeing doctors or just in self-quarantine and waiting to get well?</p>
<p>I haven’t been to the doctor. Resources are thin up here with what the local doctors describe as a “corona explosion”. I followed the advice to self-quarantine after my first symptoms and to only see a doctor in the worst case, which luckily, I haven’t needed to.</p>
<p>Who are you with and how have you been coping with the lock down? Where are you living?</p>
<p>I’m living with my friend Charlie Raposo from the British Alpine Team at the moment. He came here straight after the final World Cups were cancelled. We both decided that Verbier would be a better place to be in the event of a lockdown than heading back to the cities. looks like we were right. He has also shown symptoms and we’ve been inside for the recommended week now. It hasn’t been so bad! I’ve been catching up with my work team in Stockholm (it can get a little distracting during the season) and being productive. Of course, that’s been mixed in with some Netflix and chill.</p>
<p>Verbier was locked down a couple of weeks ago like all of Switzerland and European resorts. Did it come out of the blue or did you know the lock down was going to happen?</p>
<p>It was completely out of the blue. On the Monday we were skiing some of the best snow I’ve ever had in Verbier before heading to a packed après ski. On the Wednesday rumours started circulating that they may close the resort in two weeks. On Thursday night we heard that The Arlberg has decided to close that weekend which everyone thought was crazy! It’s turns out that was simply a prophecy, the following morning we heard that Verbier would be closing in a week; three hours later Televerbier announced they will be closing for the season that day. Two days later it was a ghost town. It all happened so fast.</p>
<p>What was the reaction around town? How are people coping and what is the mood there?</p>
<p>At first everyone was in shock, but it sunk in very quickly. I’m sure a lot of people can relate when I say that ski towns can be a fantasy land, we really didn’t understand how serious the situation was until it was too late. Right now, the mood in town is good. Most of the locals have recovered. People are abiding by the rules and there’re smiles around. It’s quiet and easy going.</p>
<p>What are the next steps? Once you well are you going to stay in Verbier – do you have any choice?</p>
<p>Charlie and I have been without symptoms for a few days now a feel back to normal which is a relief. I’ve decided to stay here for at least another month to see what happens in Stockholm. It’s very quiet here without many people so it seems ideal for this situation.</p>
<p>How’s the snow? Once you’re feeling OK, can you go touring?</p>
<p>We actually had our first tour today! The snow was terrible ha-ha, but it was great to be outside. We made sure to keep our distance from others which wasn’t hard. We maybe saw 10 others on the hill. At the moment Switzerland is the only country in the Alps where you can still tour. We’ll see if stays that way. We really hope the mountains stay open, but of course we’ll respect any further quarantine rules that are introduced by the experts.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the whole thing? Lockdowns, getting sick – it’s been wild ride! You feeling good?</p>
<p>My whole outlook has changed dramatically. Only three weeks ago the virus was an afterthought, I didn’t really take it seriously. But it turns out the ski resorts of the Alps were the perfect storm for the virus to explode. Apparently all 32 Of Sweden’s original cases came from holiday goers in the Alps, or so goes the rumour. I’m just happy that my friends and I are healthy again. If we get stuck here, it’s better than being in the city for the time being!</p>
<p>Bernie Rosow, Mammoth Lakes, California.</p>
<p>Bernie is a grooming supervisor in Mammoth where he has been working winters on the mountain for over a decade. He is also one of the best skiers in Mammoth, regularly uploading some incredible POV skiing videos to social media which has garnered Bernie over 18000 Insta followers. The lockdown ended his job and in-resort skiing for the season, three months earlier than usual.</p>
<p>When Alterra Mountain company made the decision to close Mammoth on March 15, did you finish straight away? What was your reaction?</p>
<p>I normally have Friday – Saturday as my days off. On Thursday we had decided to go to a four-day work week to save on costs due to a slow spring. After the schools were closed in California the same day, the town occupancy shot up to somewhere around 90%. On Saturday the grocery store was pillaged. It was extremely apparent that people that should have been in town for only two days were putting too much stress on our resources. Skiing is an outdoor sport, but ski towns are notoriously overcrowded on busy weekends. People came here from Southern California and stocked up for the next month in our grocery store. By Saturday evening I was personally hoping that they would close the ski area to stop the virus from invading the town. When Vail announced their closures, I knew Alterra was right behind them. I think it was 100% the right move, even though it’s a big blow to everyone.</p>
<p>How many more weeks would you have been working?</p>
<p>This is cutting my season short by 2-3 months. It’s around 1/3 of our season. That’s a lot of $$ in lost income.</p>
<p>What have you been doing since Mammoth closed? You had some snow this week. I saw you managed to get out into the back country for a few runs. Are you still able to hike for turns or is the lockdown state-wide?</p>
<p>I’ve been hiking non-stop for the last week but Mammoth just had its first positive case today. I think that is the sign that we need to stop our outdoor activities. California is under a state-wide stay at home mandate. Exercise is an excuse to be outside, but there have been more unexperienced people in the backcountry in the last week than I’ve ever seen before. It’s dangerous and it’s going to put more stress on a healthcare system that’s about to be overrun. It’s fun to share ski lines with people but I don’t want people to think that this an all right activity to do right now. I’m done posting new content to my social media. If we’re going to close everything down than let’s stop messing around and get this over with.</p>
<p>What’s the vibe like over there? I know your partner Amber and young son Alexander are in LA – are you going to join them?</p>
<p>Good question. I’m currently watching a lot of TV in my house with my roommate. Just been in my house, truck, skis, truck, and house for the last week. Haven’t talked to too many people. I’m trying to figure out what my plans are with my family. They’re still in Venice at the moment. Either I’m going down there or they’re coming up here.</p>
<p>What about the future? Mammoth Lakes will take a hit on not having any visitors for the last weeks of the season. How do think it’ll get through it?</p>
<p>This is way bigger than just Mammoth Lakes. The world will be a different place after this. In my dream fantasy world, after everything collapses and our whole way of life changes I’d like to hope we can rebuild things to be environmentally conscious. This could be the world’s chance to really do something. The global economy is going to be devastated. Big businesses are going to fail, and this could be the best chance we ever get to rebuild a better world. My pessimistic side says this isn’t possible, but we can still dream. Ski and outdoor recreation communities will recover eventually. Unfortunately, it is going to be a very hard few years ahead for most of us.</p>
<p>The below video is from one of Bernie’s final days in the backcountry last week</p>
<p>Anna Segal, Whistler</p>
<p>Australian pro skier Anna Segal now calls Pemberton, British Columbia, home and she spends the northern hemi winter skiing Whistler Blackcomb, the Coast Mountain’s backcountry and filming for her sponsors.</p>
<p>Whistler Blackcomb shut down 10 days ago and things have been tightening up throughout Canada over the past few days. How is it over there?</p>
<p>Pretty much everything has shut down in Pemberton and Whistler. Many people have lost their jobs due to the majority of work being in the tourism and hospitality industry – including my boyfriend, who is a mountain guide. All backcountry lodges and skiing operations have been shut down.</p>
<p>What is the general attitude there to touring and the backcountry after the shutdowns?</p>
<p>There’s definitely been some controversy about outdoor recreation in this area. Although it’s outside, it’s encouraging social interaction. In addition to this, there is the risk factor of getting hurt, which creates the potential of taking up medical resources and hospital beds in a time of a health crisis. So, these are all things I’ve been thinking about. Search and Rescue Whistler are also asking people not to get out in the backcountry, so I am following that advice.</p>
<p>What about you, how has it impacted on your plans for the rest of the season?</p>
<p>I was supposed to fly to AK yesterday to film for BLANK, but obviously that has also been cancelled. Bit of a bummer, but not a big deal in relation to what’s going on in the world right now. I’m feeling lucky to live in the mountains. I’ve been doing some mellow ski touring – but nothing of high risk. I’ve also been trail running and hang boarding on my back porch. We can leave our house, but are trying not to venture into public places unless it’s a necessity. National parks, playgrounds, skate parks, most restaurants/ coffee shops are all closed.</p>
<p>I imagine it’s a pretty weird time for everyone, especially for an outdoor community like you have in Pemberton and Whistler. How are you coping with it?</p>
<p>To stay sane, I’m making sure I get a good hit of exercise each day, as this always makes me feel better – a trail run or a little strength circuit on my back balcony does the trick, plus some online yoga. I’m also trying to get on top of all the chores I put on the back burner during the season- taxes, home improvement projects etc. The bright side is, it means an extended period of time at home time for me, so my partner and I decided what better time to get a pup! We adopted our new furry friend yesterday and are now in the process of getting to know him.</p>
<p>TJ Balon, Revelstoke</p>
<p>TJ Balon is a Canadian-born professional photographer who has been living in Melbourne for 25 years. His Australian wife Mon runs two snow online retail stores, plusnow.com.au and skiandboardonline.com and they have two kids, Ellie aged 10 and Finn, 10. The family moved to Revelstoke late last year, planning on staying for two winters and a summer, TJ working as a guide/photographer for the CMH Heli ski while Mon continues to run her online business.</p>
<p>TJ, how did the lock-down pan out for you? You’ve been working for CMH all winter – but that operation was also part of the shutdown.</p>
<p>Well two weeks ago I was finishing up after a 15-day shift and was headed to the Nomads lodge to go shoot for a private Heli trip. Now I’m one day from coming out of self-isolation with the family. We have just found out that one of the CMH guests from last week has tested positive when he got home. Not sure where he picked it up.</p>
<p>How was it in Revelstoke when they closed the mountain?</p>
<p>When the mountain took so long to close down people were pretty shitty in town especially as all the spring-breakers were about to head here and there is limited hospital beds. Now everything is shut down and the town is almost completely in lockdown</p>
<p>It is not a full lock-down, but no businesses are open. Nobody wants to be next to anyone right at this point. Essentials are still open – pharmacy, town logistics, hospitals, super markets. There are apparently three out of town cases that were in town earlier and now people are waiting to see if it causes any ripples.</p>
<p>How has it been for you? How’s the family coping?</p>
<p>Me and the family are quite lucky. We back onto a forest and I’ve have made a little ski track for the kids to play around with. The kids and I have Canadian passports and I wasn’t planning to work this summer anyway and spend more family time with the kids after working so much this winter at the lodge. We can ride this out and hopefully see the other side next season.</p>
<p>Your kids are pretty young, only 10 and seven, how has it been for them? What are your thoughts on all of this as a parent?</p>
<p>I sat our 10-year-old down and explained properly what was going on and that it was a bit of a big deal. She nodded and took a good chunk of it in but, she has the blessing of being naive to these sorts of emergencies and dramas of the world. She knows and “gets it” but does she really GET it? I don’t know and only time will tell. It’s nice to have the kids around to keep entertained as we need it as much as they do in these scary times.</p>
<p>We haven’t hit full down yet in Australia, but it feels like it’ll be any day now. Are you glad you’re over there?</p>
<p>I reckon I’m happy to be here right now in the middle of nowhere with nature to keep us going. What we’ve seen Australia turn into over this with the supermarket hoarding and fighting. After only just coming out of the fires, and everyone helping each other out, to that. Shakes my faith in Humanity a bit.

<h3 id="drought-blamed-for-conflict-in-kenya-from-illegal-grazing">&ldquo;Drought Blamed for Conflict in Kenya From Illegal Grazing&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/819FFAD3-2218-469E-A1FA-0FDA7119CC62.jpg" alt="img">
NAIROBI - Boasting spectacular wildlife and majestic scenery, central Kenya’s Laikipia area has long been on the country’s tourist circuit, sitting against the backdrop of Mount Kenya.</p>
<p>But due to drought, northern pastoralists are illegally bringing tens of thousands of cattle to private and community lands in search of water and grazing lands, often bringing them into conflict with landowners, and displacing wildlife.</p>
<p>Laikipia Kenya Laikipia, Kenya Laikipia, Kenya</p>
<p>Several people have been killed in these conflicts, with others injured. Attacks on three out of approximately 50 ranches, farms, and conservancies have been reported, including a tourist lodge that was burned down at the end of January.</p>
<p>But Laikipia Farmers’ Association chairman Martin Evans says all land owners have been affected in some way.</p>
<p>“Every single owner’s had damage,” said Evans. “When they come in, they smash your fences, they smash all your infrastructure, all your buildings, your security houses, your solar panels, electric energizers, they steal and smash. I haven’t heard of one who hasn’t been.”</p>
<p>Drought impact</p>
<p>Kenya’s spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Mwenda Njoka blames it on one factor.</p>
<p>“Drought, drought, drought,” said Njoka. “The dry stint that has been in that area for a long time and in many other parts of the country. That is what has caused these people to move their cattle to areas where there is grass and water.”</p>
<p>But that is not an excuse, says Paula Kahumbu, CEO of WildlifeDirect.</p>
<p>Armed Turkana tribesmen wait for cattle to get wat Armed Turkana tribesmen wait for cattle to get water from a borehole near Baragoy, Kenya, Feb. 14, 2017. Armed Turkana tribesmen wait for cattle to get water from a borehole near Baragoy, Kenya, Feb. 14, 2017.</p>
<p>“This drought was known about more than six months ago. These incidents started more than six months ago. There was ample opportunity for the state and state organs to respond and they didn’t,” said Kahumbu. “These cattle should have been bought up and the people had their money put away somewhere safe well before the drought reached this point.”</p>
<p>And, it’s not just a drought that is based on climatic conditions, argues Frank Pope, CEO of Save the Elephants.</p>
<p>“This is a drought based on chronic overgrazing of this ecosystem,” said Pope. “We’ve got several different data streams showing us the dramatic degradation that northern Kenya has suffered, and I think the same holds true for many other areas in Kenya where we’ve had too many livestock on the ground, exerting huge grazing pressure on the ground. About three-quarters of the northern rangelands is now at or below the level of organic soil carbon required for plant growth.”</p>
<p>Complex issue</p>
<p>It is is a complex socio-economic issue, according to Njoka, who says the government is working to get the situation under control.</p>
<p>“We’ve been doing a lot,” said Njoka. “And we’ve sent security forces, police officers who are deployed to the area, from different units, to go and protect these farms and ensure they are not invaded. Although sometimes it has not been as successful as we’d have wanted, but there’s a lot the government has been doing on that.”</p>
<p>Kahumbu says the pastoralists are highly adapted to extremely dry conditions, which demonstrates the severity of their current situation.</p>
<p>“So for them to have resorted to raiding private land and community land, is really a reflection of how serious the drought is,” said Kahumbu. “It’s a famine for them, so let’s not forget that these are people who are in dire straights and the government of Kenya has failed them too, which is why they’re doing what they’re doing.”</p>
<p>But Kahumbu and other conservationists cannot fully explain why wildlife have been killed. The Kenya Wildlife Service has recorded at least nine elephant deaths, as well as those of other endangered species like giraffes and the Grevy’s zebra.</p>
<p>“The wildlife is the lowest on the chain when it comes to competing with livestock, because the livestock are accompanied by humans, and these humans have arms, often,” said Pope.</p>
<p>Because few wildlife trophies have been taken, some conservationists believe retribution may be more at play than poaching.</p>
<p>Kenya is to hold national elections in August. Evans, Kahumbu and Pope argue politicians directly or indirectly condone their constituents encroaching onto private land, to win their support. But Njoka responds the elections have nothing to do with the situation.</p>
<p>The Laikipia Farmers’ Association wants the government to begin a disarmament program, prosecute the people involved, and enforce the law. Some conservation groups suggest the government buy some livestock to assist the pastoralists, as well as to bring harvested grass from other parts of the country to Laikipia to help feed the animals.</p>
<p>But everyone agrees a long-term solution must be found.

<h3 id="nintendo-reconfirms-release-windows-for-major-switch-games-and-its-a-pretty-small-list">&ldquo;Nintendo Reconfirms Release Windows For Major Switch Games, And It&rsquo;s A Pretty Small List&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://images.nintendolife.com/c839445f92406/1280x720.jpg" alt="img">
Whenever Nintendo releases a financial earnings report, we also receive an updated list of any major upcoming games and their release dates. Today is one of those days, but there really isn&rsquo;t all that much to write home about.</p>
<p>As you can see, the biggest titles are still tucked away behind &lsquo;TBA&rsquo; release windows. There are no new release dates or surprises to speak of, although it is at least relieving to see that the Nintendo-published games already announced to launch this summer haven&rsquo;t been pushed back due to the ongoing global pandemic.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s safe to assume that plenty more titles will be in development that we still haven&rsquo;t heard about - potentially including those rumoured Super Mario remasters - but here&rsquo;s what Nintendo currently has in store:</p>
<p>Japan (correct as of May 2020)</p>
<p>The United States (correct as of October 2019)</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition - 29th May, 2020</p>
<p>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics - 5th June, 2020</p>
<p>Bravely Default II - 2020</p>
<ul>
<li>2020 Bayonetta 3 - TBA</li>
</ul>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 (temp.) - TBA</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Sequel (temp.) - TBA</p>
<p>Europe (correct as of October 2019)</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition - 29th May, 2020</p>
<p>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics - 5th June, 2020</p>
<p>Bravely Default II - 2020</p>
<p>Bayonetta 3 - TBA</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 - TBA</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Sequel - TBA</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say how the rest of 2020 might play out given the circumstances; Nintendo has warned today that &ldquo;development schedules may be impacted&rdquo; if the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) are prolonged or get any worse.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Nintendo&rsquo;s able to pull some more treats out of the bag later this year.
