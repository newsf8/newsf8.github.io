<p>Updated at 2:47 p.m. ET on May 28, 2020.</p>
<p>By all estimates, the novel coronavirus is quickly becoming the most disruptive pandemic in more than a century. New developments and warnings are being issued every day. The uncertainty of this moment has also led to abundant misinformation, some coming from the president himself. As you sort through the onslaught, here are some stories to help you make sense of life during a pandemic. The Atlantic is choosing to make these freely available to all readers, even those who don’t subscribe. This list will be updated with our continuing coverage.</p>
<p>We Don’t Even Have a COVID-19 Vaccine, and Yet the Conspiracies Are Here, by Sarah Zhang Mistrust of and misinformation about vaccines runs deep in the United States. Though experts hope that widespread fear of falling ill or spreading disease during a global pandemic will be enough to convince skeptics that they’re better off receiving an eventual vaccine, anti-vaccine messaging and existing coronavirus conspiracies could make such cooperation unlikely. And the Trump administration’s inconsistent and faulty statements about public health and vaccine development will only make it more difficult for the scientific community to gain the public’s trust. Zhang lays out several important variables that could affect how receptive America is to a COVID-19 vaccine, including factors as unpredictable as timing: The vaccine’s timing could affect its reception too. Heidi Larson, whose Vaccine Confidence Project has been regularly surveying people in Europe throughout the pandemic, says the numbers have changed slightly over time: In mid-March, 7 percent said they would refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine, which dropped to 5 percent two weeks later, when COVID-19 deaths spiked, and rose to 9 percent when talk turned to loosening lockdowns. “The public is in general pretty sensible in how they make their decision, and they are weighing their different perceived risks or benefits,” she says. If the pandemic seems as if it’s waning, fewer will be willing to take a chance on a new vaccine.</p>
<p>Is Everyone Depressed? by James Hamblin Many of the classic signs of depression—lethargy, social withdrawal, disinterest in activities—suddenly seem like nearly unavoidable side effects of Americans’ daily routines. The coronavirus has rapidly worsened the mental-health crisis in the U.S. At the same time, it’s also made discerning whether depressive feelings are circumstantial or indicative of underlying disorders more difficult. Identifying clinical depression and doling out treatment appropriately is difficult in person, and even harder over video calls. In the absence of methods to easily pinpoint who needs treatment most urgently, ensuring that mental-health resources match the scale of those who need them for any reason could be a better plan. Just as, in the time of COVID-19, not everyone with a cough can go to the hospital, clinicians are working to identify and prioritize those who truly need in-person mental-health attention. Jennifer Rapke, the head of inpatient consultation at Upstate Golisano Children’s Hospital in New York, has seen a surge in teenagers reporting suicidal ideation and instances of self-harm, so she has been carefully turning away the less severe cases to make sure that inpatient facilities aren’t overwhelmed. “We’re only seeing people who absolutely need to be here,” she says. Meanwhile, those with milder, emerging cases are sometimes left in limbo. “The places we would normally send people, the things we would put in place to address the depression or the anxiety in early phases—they don’t exist or they’re unavailable,” Rapke says.</p>
<p>Social Distancing Is Not Enough, by Derek Thompson As parts of America slowly begin to reopen, we’re starting to get a sense of what it might take to return to shared indoor spaces. Activities will return, but in altered forms to keep people safe in the great indoors. Sports events could open with limited seating, zero concessions, and staggered admission times. Restaurants might ask customers to order online before arriving. And between-desk barriers could become ubiquitous, along with a slew of other workplace precautions: Office meetings, once merely obnoxious, are deemed simply noxious. The South Korean government devotes a full page and 12 bullet points to the subject of meetings, but those recommendations can be boiled down to three words that will make meeting-haters rejoice: fewer, smaller, shorter. For meetings that are necessary, large, and long, South Korea recommends masks for all participants and, if possible, open windows. Ventilation, in general, will become a watchword. Many offices may have to overhaul their vent technology or hire professionals to improve airflow throughout the entire office.</p>
<p>“How Could the CDC Make That Mistake?”, by Alexis C. Madrigal and Robinson Meyer The CDC began releasing nationwide coronavirus testing data in mid-May with little fanfare. But when the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic compared the data with numbers put out by individual states, our reporters found dramatic inaccuracies in the agency’s figures, including a complete failure to distinguish at all between viral and antibody tests. That makes the CDC’s testing numbers virtually useless for any attempts at containing the virus. Viral tests, taken by nose swab or saliva sample, look for direct evidence of a coronavirus infection. They are considered the gold standard for diagnosing someone with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus: State governments consider a positive viral test to be the only way to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antibody tests, by contrast, use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past. A negative test result means something different for each test. If somebody tests negative on a viral test, a doctor can be relatively confident that they are not sick right now; if somebody tests negative on an antibody test, they have probably never been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus. (Or they may have been given a false result—antibody tests are notoriously less accurate on an individual level than viral tests.) The problem is that the CDC is clumping negative results from both tests together in its public reporting.</p>
<p>America’s Patchwork Pandemic Is Fraying Even Further, by Ed Yong Ed Yong’s fourth deep look at the country’s crisis reveals how federal failures created a dangerous patchwork of viral spread with little oversight. Different cities and rural areas that may think they’ve evaded the virus could still become the next hot spots, he writes. And nearly every feature of the virus helps enable this uneven and staggered movement. Even the spread from person to person can be unpredictable: Consider “super-spreader events,” in which dozens or hundreds of new infections stemming from a single person create entirely new branches of the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a hurricane or some other disaster that will come and go, signaling an obvious moment when recovery can begin. It is not like the epidemics of fiction, which get worse until, after some medical breakthrough, they get better. It is messier, patchier, and thus harder to predict, control, or understand. “We’re in that zone that we don’t see movies made about,” says Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public-health law at American University.</p>
<p>Why the Coronavirus Hits Kids and Adults So Differently, by Sarah Zhang On the whole, common infectious diseases tend to be most dangerous to children. But coronaviruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, are rarer, and have tended to largely spare children. That might be because, as we age, the variety within our infection-fighting T cells decreases in favor of strengthening our defenses against the illnesses we encounter most. Adults’ immune systems are more practiced at identifying and disarming common infectious agents, while a younger immune system might be better equipped to defend against an obscure intruder. The two human viruses most closely related to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 are the ones behind SARS and MERS—both also coronaviruses, a large family that infects many animal species. SARS likely jumped from bats to civet cats to humans in 2002, and MERS from camels to humans in 2012. Both have a much higher fatality rate than COVID-19 and neither exploded into a pandemic on the current scale, giving us smaller numbers from which to draw conclusions. Still, they too seemed to have largely spared children. Like COVID-19, SARS and MERS were caused by viruses entirely new to humans, and adult immune systems are unused to dealing with entirely new viruses. By and large, the ones that sicken adults year after year are altered versions of viruses they’ve encountered before, such as seasonal flu. Children, on the other hand, are constantly dealing with viruses that are not necessarily novel but are novel to them. “Everything an infant sees, or a young child sees, is new,” says Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University. Thus, their immune system is primed to fight new pathogens in a number of ways.</p>
<p>You’ll Probably Never Know If You Had the Coronavirus in January, by Rachel Gutman Many Americans are eager to know whether that lingering cough or punishing fever they had back in the winter was in fact COVID-19. The official tally of coronavirus cases in January is certainly an undercount, but all the available evidence suggests that the number of infections in the U.S. that month was still very, very small. Coming up with a precise number will require data about travel, deaths, and blood tests that are currently unavailable or unreliable. It’s possible we’ll arrive at an answer, but even if we do, it will be all but impossible to identify the specific people who were infected. Unfortunately, experts generally agree that the actual number of Americans carrying the virus by the end of January was nowhere near high enough to support speculation about herd immunity and star-studded superspreader events. Beyond that, the estimates vary widely. Lauren Gardner, an associate professor of engineering at Johns Hopkins University, who created the school’s popular dashboard for tracking coronavirus cases, told me that “there could have been hundreds of cases in the U.S. in January and thousands by the end of February.” Trevor Bedford, a biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has been at the forefront of the genetic study of SARS-CoV-2, says that “more than 10, less than 100 would be my guess.” Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me that she’s “confident it is not zero” and that “it seems like it’s not millions.”</p>
<p>The Problem With Stories About Dangerous Coronavirus Mutations, by Ed Yong In recent weeks, a popular claim that multiple strains of the coronavirus could be spreading in tandem has sparked fear of a double pandemic, one tamer and one deadly. There is in fact no scientific evidence for this claim, and researchers agree that only one recognizable strain of the virus has surfaced thus far. While small mutations have likely occurred, none have produced especially distinct—or deadly—lineages of the virus. As an epidemic progresses, the virus family tree grows new branches and twigs—new lineages that are characterized by differing sets of mutations. But a new lineage doesn’t automatically count as a new strain. That term is usually reserved for a lineage that differs from its fellow viruses in significant ways. It might vary in how easily it spreads (transmissibility), its ability to cause disease (virulence), whether it is recognized by the immune system in the same way (antigenicity), or how vulnerable it is to medications (resistance). Some mutations affect these properties. Most do not, and are either silent or cosmetic. “Not every mutation creates a different strain,” says Grubaugh. (Think about dog breeds as equivalents of strains: A corgi is clearly different from a Great Dane, but a black-haired corgi is functionally the same as a brown-haired one, and wouldn’t count as a separate breed.)</p>
<p>Food Banks Can’t Go On Like This, by Conor Friedersdorf Even before the pandemic, changes to the food supply chain and food assistance policies had driven up costs and complications for food banks. As economic collapse drives more and more Americans to food banks, donations of “rescued” food (think a coffeeshop offloading pastries at the end of the day) have simultaneously dried up. And communities across the country are facing varied challenges in connecting people in need with support systems. Friedersdorf argues that local food banks and those who rely on them should be permitted to bypass some of the hoops they’ve been forced to jump through to ensure everyone gets fed during the pandemic. Facing Hunger Foodbank in West Virginia used to serve about 129,000 people on a typical day. Its executive director, Cynthia D. Kirkhart, witnessed the same sharp rise in demand after her state issued its stay-at-home order. Then the retail donations that the food bank receives from partners such as Walmart and Kroger shrank by roughly 90 percent, and delivery times for purchased food grew from a week to eight or 10 weeks. “Between March 30 and April 8, I placed orders in excess of $487,000 for food, and some of it won’t be arriving until late June, but at least I’ll have a regular influx coming in,” she told me. “My total budget for this year was about $500,000. My reworked budget is going to look more like $1.2 million to $1.5 million, and that’s with an optimistic outlook for what happens with this pandemic and how long we are in recovery.”</p>
<p>What’s Behind South Korea’s COVID-19 Exceptionalism? by Derek Thompson South Korea beat the coronavirus by design, not because of millennia-old cultural values. A brush with MERS less than a decade ago inspired the country’s government to revamp and fortify its public-health planning and infrastructure. As a result, thanks to free testing, detailed tracing, and mandatory isolation, South Korea was able to effectively contain the spread of the coronavirus within weeks—something no other large democracy has done as successfully. “Test, trace, and isolate” is the three-legged stool of South Korean public-health policy. But what keeps the stool upright is the shared confidence between the government and the public. “A delicate balance of trust … drives the entire thing,” the writer Yung in Chae told me. People trust the government in part because it works to keep raw politics out of public health. South Korea’s Ministry of Health has for months held daily briefings to update the public and convey best practices, such as social distancing and hand-washing. And the government trusts the public to act as a responsible co-partner in public health. Rather than announcing an official lockdown that would fully close restaurants and businesses and force citizens to stay home, the Korean government has opted to keep more of its economy open. “We were never on lockdown, and we’re still not on lockdown,” Paul Choi, a consultant who lives in Seoul, told me. “But citizens have taken it upon ourselves to stay inside. We’re very careful to wash our hands and keep our distance. Almost everybody is wearing masks. If you don’t wear masks, you get looks on the street.”</p>
<p>Should You Get an Antibody Test? By James Hamblin Antibody tests have been touted as one of the key tools that will eventually allow people to freely interact with their communities again. But what do these blood tests actually measure, and who (if anyone) should be seeking them out right now? James Hamblin, an Atlantic staff writer and a medical doctor, assembled a basic FAQ of everything you need to know about how your immune system responds to the coronavirus and the current uses of antibody tests. One question he addresses is why antibody testing is receiving so much attention: Right now, the antibody tests are being used to help map out where the coronavirus has spread, like tracking the footprints it has left. Combined with other types of research, this information will eventually help identify who is most susceptible to infection, and why. Even if we can’t tell individuals that they are totally protected, we could theoretically begin to allocate scarce resources away from a city where 50 percent of people have antibodies to one where only 5 percent of people do.</p>
<p>Georgia’s Experiment in Human Sacrifice, by Amanda Mull Georgia’s decision to reopen businesses against the advice of public-health experts will kill people, so why is the state proceeding? The decision was made by a state leadership that values its economy over human life, Mull argues. Ultimately, Georgia will end up serving as the country’s canary in the coal mine. The state’s business owners are aware of the role they’re playing, and some aren’t happy about it. Many Georgians have no delusions about the risks of reopening, even if they need to return to work for financial reasons. Among the dozen local leaders, business owners, and workers I spoke with for this article, all said they know some people who disagreed with the lockdown but were complying nonetheless. No one reported serious acrimony in their communities. Instead, their stories depict a struggle between a state government and ordinary people. Georgia’s brash reopening puts much of the state’s working class in an impossible bind: risk death at work, or risk ruining yourself financially at home. In the grips of a pandemic, the approach is a morbid experiment in just how far states can push their people.</p>
<p>Why the Coronavirus is so Confusing, by Ed Yong Even to researchers, much about how the coronavirus operates and spreads is still a mystery. But that’s not cause for alarm: It’s just how the scientific process works. Yong breaks down each of the factors that experts need to investigate—including the disease itself, the public-health messaging, and the flurry of statistics—before the coronavirus can be understood more clearly. He also examines how the mismatched speeds of science and human curiosity can lead nervous people to bad information. The pandemic’s length traps people in a liminal space. To clarify their uprooted life and indefinite future, they try to gather as much information as possible—and cannot stop. “We go seeking fresher and fresher information, and end up consuming unvetted misinformation that’s spreading rapidly,” Bergstrom says. Pandemics actually “unfold in slow motion,” he says, and “there’s no event that changes the whole landscape on a dime.” But it feels that way, because of how relentlessly we quest for updates. Historically, people would have struggled to find enough information. Now people struggle because they’re finding too much.</p>
<p>Efficiency is Biting Back, by Edward Tenner High-tech upgrades to health systems, living spaces, travel, and more all likely helped spread the coronavirus, which might have otherwise remained an isolated disease. As Americans imagine the better, more efficient society that could be ushered in after months of living our lives mostly remotely, it’s worth remembering that streamlining daily life can have disastrous consequences. In practice, the pursuit of efficiency has often resulted in the consolidation of smaller companies and facilities into larger ones; in greater congestion as more people are packed into smaller spaces, whether in office towers or aboard commercial airliners; and in the tight coupling of deliveries and other business processes in ways that, at least when all goes well, speed up production and reduce warehouse inventories. But consolidation, congestion, and tight coupling may also make our economy less efficient in the long run—and our society more vulnerable to outside shocks such as the coronavirus. Efficiency, in fact, can be hazardous to our well-being, and a strategic amount of inefficiency is crucial in keeping society healthy.</p>
<p>Medication Shortages Are the Next Crisis, by Jeremy Samuel Faust With the United States playing “catch-up” with the coronavirus crisis, emergency physicians such as Faust have wondered whether they should be rationing lifesaving medications more strictly. Many hospitals are running low on the drugs needed to treat COVID-19, endangering both coronavirus patients and people who take the same medications for other conditions. The simplest solution, Faust argues, would be for the federal government to eliminate delays by more closely overseeing the manufacturing and distribution of essential drugs. Here are steps the federal government can take now to make sure that hospitals are well stocked during the pandemic and after it passes, when doctors turn to operations delayed by the COVID-19 surge. First, it needs to improve data collection to track how manufacturing capacity is stacking up against medical demand. Then, it needs to compel pharmaceutical companies and their suppliers to accelerate the production of needed drugs.</p>
<p>Doctors Are Holding Up Their End of the Bargain. Society Is Not. by Graeme Wood The role that health-care workers are playing right now is not unlike that of the military during wartime. So why, Wood asks, are we not systematizing the work of doctors as we do the work of the military? If we require doctors’ sacrifice in times of public-health catastrophes, we should also require that their safety and equipment become the burden and priority of the rest of us, he argues. Alex Kon, a physician and bioethicist, says that until about a hundred years ago, doctors regularly fled epidemics. Only since then, after a quasi-military ethos of not abandoning one’s post penetrated the medical profession, did expectations change. Now there is an unwritten “covenant,” Kon says, according to which doctors hold their positions, and society is supposed to reciprocate by equipping them and practicing social distancing (for example) to keep their hospitals from being swamped. Doctors have abided by that covenant. The rest of us have broken it. We have failed to equip them; we have failed to elect governments that competently manage public health; we have failed to wear masks, avoid crowds, and keep the ERs as empty as possible.</p>
<p>Why It’s Important Not to Drink Bleach, by James Hamblin The president’s suggestion that cleaning products could serve as a potential medical treatment for COVID-19 is a public-health danger. Agents such as bleach and isopropyl alcohol are poisonous if ingested. The nonchalance with which Donald Trump implied that they might instead be salubrious demonstrates his disregard for the seriousness of the presidential platform, Hamblin writes—especially in light of his backpedaled attempt to pass his statements off as sarcasm. Trump’s words matter beyond the profound ignorance they betray. Approximately 50,000 Americans have now died of COVID-19. In states of emergency like this, health officials are trained to clearly say what is known and what is unknown, what is actionable and what is not. Trump consistently does the opposite, suggesting something while also saying he is not saying it, making bizarre declarations followed by hedges about how what he just said may or may not be true.</p>
<p>The Scariest Pandemic Timeline, by Olga Khazan Despite everything that Americans have been through in recent weeks, the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is possibly still months ahead of us. COVID-19 infection numbers are expected to ebb and surge from now until whenever a vaccine becomes available. The pandemic began as the country’s flu season was winding down, but thanks to that ebbing and flowing, a future wave could overlap with the next flu season. Having to contend with another round of COVID-19 patients while also taking on severe flu cases might cause hospitals to quickly run out of ventilators, beds, or even doctors. Some people might even get infected with both the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. While health experts don’t know exactly how that would make COVID-19 worse, “I can’t imagine that would be good,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said.

<h3 id="theres-a-reason-why-the-royals-are-demonised-but-you-wont-read-all-about-it--alan-rusbridger">&ldquo;There’s a reason why the royals are demonised. But you won’t read all about it | Alan Rusbridger&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ed7b343b85198f71fe8c1da7e1c700690532af/0_7_3565_2139/master/3565.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=d155a3c7e6376bc1b829faa97a3d8a39" alt="img">
To understand the “real” story of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, it helps to think in three dimensions. On one level, we have a story about a couple who, for perfectly understandable reasons, want a different kind of life: a new start, a fresh role, less scrutiny, more peace of mind. All eminently reasonable and not very remarkable.</p>
<p>But there is, of course, the second level: they’re inescapably royal. This is hardly the abdication: the constitutional ramifications of the sixth in line bailing out to a new life in Canada are not earth-shattering. But, whether you are a pope or a prince, there are undoubtedly complications in trying to assert a private identity that is decoupled from your apparent destiny or birthright.</p>
<p>The third level is the storytellers. Almost everything we think we know about this couple is filtered through journalists. It is unusually difficult to judge the reliability of most royal reporting because it is a world almost devoid of open or named sources. So, in order to believe what we’re being told, we have to take it on trust that there are currently legions of “aides”, “palace insiders”, “friends” and “senior courtiers” constantly WhatsApping their favourite reporters with the latest gossip. It has been known to happen. Maybe they are, maybe they aren’t. We just don’t know.</p>
<p>But trust in this third dimension is further compromised by the fact that none of the major players filtering this story for our consumption is exactly a disinterested bystander. All three of the major newspaper groups most obsessed with Harry and Meghan are themselves being sued by the couple for assorted breaches of privacy and copyright. There is, to any reasonable eyes, a glaring conflict of interest that, for the most part, goes undeclared.</p>
<p>For some years now – largely unreported – two chancery court judges have been dealing with literally hundreds of cases of phone hacking against MGN Ltd and News Group, the owners, respectively, of the Daily Mirror and the Sun (as well as the defunct News of the World).</p>
<p>The two publishers are, between them, forking out eye-watering sums to avoid any cases going to trial in open court. Because the newspaper industry lobbied so forcefully to scrap the second part of the Leveson inquiry, which had been due to shine a light on such matters, we can only surmise what is going on.</p>
<p>But there are clues. Mirror Group (now Reach) had by July 2018 set aside more than £70m to settle phone-hacking claims without risking any of them getting to court. The BBC reported last year that the Murdoch titles had paid out an astonishing £400m in damages and calculated that the total bill for the two companies could eventually reach £1bn.</p>
<p>Last October, Prince Harry added his own name to the list of people claiming they had been hacked by both the Sun and the Mirror.</p>

<p>To understand why this is, to put it mildly, a bombshell, you would have needed to be following the patient work of Mr Justice Mann (and before him, Mr Justice Vos) in the anonymous Rolls Building, home to the chancery court, just off London’s Strand.</p>
<p>Publicly available court documents detail the alleged involvement of Rupert Murdoch’s son James and the reinstated CEO of News UK, Rebekah Brooks, in suppressing or concealing the true extent of wrongdoing within the Murdoch titles. The Sun’s official position is to “not admit” any unlawful activity, while simultaneously shelling out enormous sums so that this position can never be tested.</p>
<p>Over at the Mirror Group, there is a similar shyness about allowing daylight into the activities of past executives. Former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan, one of the most vehement critics of the royal couple, does not find time or space to let his readers or viewers know that his name crops up very many times in the generic phone-hacking litigation particulars of claims in front of Mann. Morgan may be entirely innocent, but if you spend your time pouring venom over a claimant in a case that might touch on your own conduct, you’d think there was at least an interest to declare – every single time you do it.</p>
<p>And then there is the further legal action by Meghan against Associated Newspapers claiming assorted breaches of copyright, privacy and data protection. The Mail on Sunday claims “huge and legitimate public interest” in publishing extracts from a private letter from Meghan to her father. We shall see, but meanwhile there’s no harm in portraying her as a ruthless hypocrite and gold-digger. If Morgan’s on hand with the vitriol, everyone’s happy.</p>
<p>So, when reading about Harry and Meghan, it really does pay to keep your wits about you. There is a surface level to the story – not all of it untrue – and there are many anonymous sources of varying degrees of reliability to give colour and context. And, in the background, there are quite a lot of worried newspaper executives and former editors, who have absolutely zero interest in treating the couple kindly or even-handedly.</p>
<p>The metrics are irresistible: this couple sell newspapers and attract eyeballs by the billion. There is little hope that editors are going to dial down their coverage. But there is kindness; and there is fairness; and there is honesty. A little bit of each of those would help the rest of us understand better and trust more.</p>

<h3 id="why-its-time-to-stop-worrying-about-the-decline-of-the-english-language">&ldquo;Why it’s time to stop worrying about the decline of the English language&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ea761bdc73a8d5f2b713cba00e754a308c6598b/1952_1382_3949_2370/master/3949.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=dbb59be76c93c0c0a2a2d003395ebb4f" alt="img">
The 21st century seems to present us with an ever-lengthening list of perils: climate crisis, financial meltdown, cyber-attacks. Should we stock up on canned foods in case the ATMs snap shut? Buy a shedload of bottled water? Hoard prescription medicines? The prospect of everything that makes modern life possible being taken away from us is terrifying. We would be plunged back into the middle ages, but without the skills to cope.</p>
<p>Now imagine that something even more fundamental than electricity or money is at risk: a tool we have relied on since the dawn of human history, enabling the very foundations of civilisation to be laid. I’m talking about our ability to communicate – to put our thoughts into words, and to use those words to forge bonds, to deliver vital information, to learn from our mistakes and build on the work done by others.</p>
<p>The doomsayers admit that this apocalypse may take some time – years, or decades, even – to unfold. But the direction of travel is clear. As things stand, it is left to a few heroic individuals to raise their voices in warning about the dangers of doing nothing to stave off this threat. “There is a worrying trend of adults mimicking teen-speak. They are using slang words and ignoring grammar,” Marie Clair, of the Plain English Campaign, told the Daily Mail. “Their language is deteriorating. They are lowering the bar. Our language is flying off at all tangents, without the anchor of a solid foundation.”</p>
<p>The Queen’s English Society, a British organisation, has long been fighting to prevent this decline. Although it is at pains to point out that it does not believe language can be preserved unchanged, it worries that communication is at risk of becoming far less effective. “Some changes would be wholly unacceptable, as they would cause confusion and the language would lose shades of meaning,” the society says on its website.</p>
<p>With a reduced expressive capacity, it seems likely that research, innovation and the quality of public discourse would suffer. The columnist Douglas Rushkoff put it like this in a 2013 New York Times opinion piece: “Without grammar, we lose the agreed-upon standards about what means what. We lose the ability to communicate when respondents are not actually in the same room speaking to one another. Without grammar, we lose the precision required to be effective and purposeful in writing.”</p>
<p>At the same time, our laziness and imprecision are leading to unnecessary bloating of the language – “language obesity,” as the British broadcaster John Humphrys has described it. This is, he said, “the consequence of feeding on junk words. Tautology is the equivalent of having chips with rice. We talk of future plans and past history; of live survivors and safe havens. Children have temper tantrums and politicians announce ‘new initiatives’.”</p>
<p>It is frightening to think where all this might lead. If English is in such a bad state now, what will things be like in a generation’s time? We must surely act before it is too late.</p>
<p>But there is something perplexing about claims like this. By their nature, they imply that we were smarter and more precise in the past. Seventy-odd years ago, people knew their grammar and knew how to talk clearly. And, if we follow the logic, they must also have been better at organising, finding things out and making things work.</p>
<p>John Humphrys was born in 1943. Since then, the English-speaking world has grown more prosperous, better educated and more efficiently governed, despite an increase in population. Most democratic freedoms have been preserved and intellectual achievement intensified.</p>
<p>Linguistic decline is the cultural equivalent of the boy who cried wolf, except the wolf never turns up. Perhaps this is why, even though the idea that language is going to the dogs is widespread, nothing much has been done to mitigate it: it’s a powerful intuition, but the evidence of its effects has simply never materialised. That is because it is unscientific nonsense.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as linguistic decline, so far as the expressive capacity of the spoken or written word is concerned. We need not fear a breakdown in communication. Our language will always be as flexible and sophisticated as it has been up to now. Those who warn about the deterioration of English haven’t learned about the history of the language, and don’t understand the nature of their own complaints – which are simply statements of preference for the way of doing things they have become used to. The erosion of language to the point that “ultimately, no doubt, we shall communicate with a series of grunts” (Humphrys again) will not, cannot, happen. The clearest evidence for this is that warnings about the deterioration of English have been around for a very long time.</p>
<p>In 1785, a few years after the first volume of Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire had been published, things were so bad that the poet and philosopher James Beattie declared: “Our language (I mean the English) is degenerating very fast.” Some 70 years before that, Jonathan Swift had issued a similar warning. In a letter to Robert, Earl of Oxford, he complained: “From the Civil War to this present Time, I am apt to doubt whether the Corruptions in our Language have not at least equalled the Refinements of it … most of the Books we see now a-days, are full of those Manglings and Abbreviations. Instances of this Abuse are innumerable: What does Your Lordship think of the Words, Drudg’d, Disturb’d, Rebuk’t, Fledg’d, and a thousand others, every where to be met in Prose as well as Verse?”</p>
<p>Swift would presumably have thought The History of the Decline and Fall, revered as a masterpiece today, was a bit of a mess. He knew when the golden age of English was: “The Period wherein the English Tongue received most Improvement, I take to commence with the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s Reign, and to conclude with the Great Rebellion in [Sixteen] Forty Two.”</p>
<p>Get the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</p>
<p>But the problem is that writers at that time also felt they were speaking a degraded, faltering tongue. In The Arte of English Poesie, published in 1589, the critic George Puttenham fretted about the importation of new, foreign words – “strange terms of other languages … and many dark words and not usual nor well sounding, though they be daily spoken in Court.” That was halfway through Swift’s golden age. Just before it, in the reign of Elizabeth’s sister, Mary, the Cambridge professor John Cheke wrote with anxiety that “Our own tongue should be written clean and pure, unmixed and unmangled with borrowing of other tongues.”</p>
<p>This concern for purity – and the need to take a stand against a rising tide of corruption – goes back even further. In the 14th century, Ranulf Higden complained about the state English was in. His words, quoted in David Crystal’s The Stories of English, were translated from the Latin by a near-contemporary, John Trevisa: “By intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and afterwards with Normans, in many people the language of the land is harmed, and some use strange inarticulate utterance, chattering, snarling, and harsh teeth-gnashing.”</p>
<p>That’s five writers, across a span of 400 years, all moaning about the same erosion of standards. And yet the period also encompasses some of the greatest works of English literature.</p>
<p>It’s worth pausing here to take a closer look at Trevisa’s translation, for the sentence I’ve reproduced is a version in modern English. The original is as follows: “By commyxstion and mellyng furst wiþ danes and afterward wiþ Normans in menye þe contray longage ys apeyred, and som vseþ strange wlaffyng, chyteryng, harrying and garryng, grisbittyng.”</p>
<p>For those who worry about language deteriorating, proper usage is best exemplified by the speech and writing of a generation or so before their own. The logical conclusion is that the generation or two before that would be even better, the one before that even more so. As a result, we should find Trevisa’s language vastly more refined, more correct, more clear and more effective. The problem is, we can’t even read it.</p>
<p>Hand-wringing about standards is not restricted to English. The fate of every language in the world has been lamented by its speakers at some point or another. In the 13th century, the Arabic lexicographer Ibn Manzur described himself as a linguistic Noah – ushering words into a protective ark in order that they might survive the onslaught of laziness. Elias Muhanna, a professor of comparative literature, describes one of Manzur’s modern-day counterparts: “Fi’l Amr, a language-advocacy group [in Lebanon], has launched a campaign to raise awareness about Arabic’s critical condition by staging mock crime scenes around Beirut depicting “murdered” Arabic letters, surrounded by yellow police tape that reads: ‘Don’t kill your language.’”</p>
<p>The linguist Rudi Keller gives similar examples from Germany. “Hardly a week goes by,” he writes, “in which some reader of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung doesn’t write a letter to the editor expressing fear for the future of the German language.” As Keller puts it: “For more than 2,000 years, complaints about the decay of respective languages have been documented in literature, but no one has yet been able to name an example of a ‘decayed language’.” He has a point.</p>
<p>The hard truth is that English, like all other languages, is constantly evolving. It is the speed of the change, within our own short lives, that creates the illusion of decline. Because change is often generational, older speakers recognise that the norms they grew up with are falling away, replaced with new ones they are not as comfortable using. This cognitive difficulty doesn’t feel good, and the bad feelings are translated into criticism and complaint. We tend to find intellectual justifications for our personal preferences, whatever their motivation. If we lived for hundreds of years, we would be able to see the bigger picture. Because when you zoom out, you can appreciate that language change is not just a question of slovenliness: it happens at every level, from the superficial to the structural.</p>
<p>Any given language is significantly reconfigured over the centuries, to the extent that it becomes totally unrecognisable. But, as with complex systems in the natural world, there is often a kind of homeostasis: simplification in one area can lead to greater complexity in another. What stays the same is the expressive capacity of the language. You can always say what needs to be said.</p>
<p>Frequently, these changes are unexpected and revealing. They shed light on the workings of our minds, mouths and culture. One common driver of linguistic change is a process called reanalysis. This can happen when a language is learned for the first time, when babies begin to talk and construe what they hear slightly differently from their parents. In the abstract, it sounds complex but, in fact, it is straightforward: when a word or sentence has a structural ambiguity, what we hear could be an instance of A, but it could also be an instance of B. For years, A has held sway, but suddenly B catches on – and changes flow from that new understanding.</p>
<p>Take the words adder, apron and umpire. They were originally “nadder”, “napron” and “numpire”. Numpire was a borrowing from the French non per – “not even” – and described someone who decided on tie-breaks in games. Given that numpire and those other words were nouns, they often found themselves next to an indefinite article – a or an – or the first-person possessive pronoun, mine. Phrases such as “a numpire” and “mine napron” were relatively common, and at some point – perhaps at the interface between two generations – the first letter came to be seen as part of the preceding word. The prerequisite for reanalysis is that communication is not seriously impaired: the reinterpretation takes place at the level of the underlying structure. A young person would be able to say “where’s mine apron?” and be understood, but they would then go on to produce phrases such as “her apron” rather than “her napron”, which older folk presumably regarded as idiotic.</p>
<p>Another form that linguistic change often takes is grammaticalisation: a process in which a common phrase is bleached of its independent meaning and made into a word with a solely grammatical function. One instance of this is the verb “to go”, when used for an action in the near future or an intention. There is a clue to its special status in the way we have started saying it. We all inherit an evolutionarily sensible tendency to expend only the minimum effort needed to complete a task. For that reason, once a word has become a grammatical marker, rather than something that carries a concrete meaning, you do not need it to be fully fleshed out. It becomes phonetically reduced – or, as some would have it, pronounced lazily. That is why “I’m going to” becomes “I’m gonna”, or even, in some dialects, “Imma”. But this change in pronunciation is only evident when “going to” is grammatical, not when it is a verb describing real movement. That is why you can say “I’m gonna study history” but not “I’m gonna the shops”. In the first sentence, all “I’m going to”/“I’m gonna” tells you is that the action (study history) is something you intend to do. In the second one, the same verb is not simply a marker of intention, it indicates movement. You cannot therefore swap it for another tense (“I will study history” v “I will the shops”).</p>
<p>Inside the OED: can the world’s biggest dictionary survive the internet? Read more</p>
<p>“Will”, the standard future tense in English, has its own history of grammaticalisation. It once indicated desire and intention. “I will” meant “I want”. We can still detect this original English meaning in phrases such as “If you will” (if you want/desire). Since desires are hopes for the future, this very common verb gradually came to be seen simply as a future marker. It lost its full meaning, becoming merely a grammatical particle. As a result, it also gets phonetically reduced, as in “I’ll”, “she’ll” and so on.</p>
<p>Human anatomy makes some changes to language more likely than others. The simple mechanics of moving from a nasal sound (m or n) to a non-nasal one can make a consonant pop up in between. Thunder used to be “thuner”, and empty “emty”. You can see the same process happening now with words such as “hamster”, which is often pronounced with an intruding “p”. Linguists call this epenthesis. It may sound like a disease, but it is definitely not pathological laziness – it’s the laws of physics at work. If you stop channelling air through the nose before opening your lips for the “s”, they will burst apart with a characteristic pop, giving us our “p”.</p>
<p>The way our brain divides up words also drives change. We split them into phonemes (building blocks of sound that have special perceptual significance) and syllables (groups of phonemes). Sometimes these jump out of place, a bit like the tightly packed lines in a Bridget Riley painting. Occasionally, such cognitive hiccups become the norm. Wasp used to be “waps”; bird used to be “brid” and horse “hros”. Remember this the next time you hear someone “aks” for their “perscription”. What’s going on there is metathesis, and it’s a very common, perfectly natural process.</p>
<p>Sound changes can come about as a result of social pressures: certain ways of saying things are seen as having prestige, while others are stigmatised. We gravitate towards the prestigious, and make efforts to avoid saying things in a way that is associated with undesirable qualities – often just below the level of consciousness. Some forms that become wildly popular, such as Kim Kardashian’s vocal fry, although prestigious for some, are derided by others. One study found that “young adult female voices exhibiting vocal fry are perceived as less competent, less educated, less trustworthy, less attractive and less hireable”.</p>
<p>All this is merely a glimpse of the richness of language change. It is universal, it is constant, and it throws up extraordinary quirks and idiosyncrasies, despite being governed by a range of more-or-less regular processes. Anyone who wants to preserve some aspect of language that appears to be changing is fighting a losing battle. Anyone who wishes people would just speak according to the norms they had drummed into them when they were growing up may as well forget about it. But what about those, such as the Queen’s English Society, who say they merely want to ensure that clear and effective communication is preserved; to encourage good change, where they find it, and discourage bad change?</p>
<p>The problem arises when deciding what might be good or bad. There are, despite what many people feel, no objective criteria by which to judge what is better or worse in communication. Take the loss of so-called major distinctions in meaning bemoaned by the Queen’s English Society. The word “disinterested”, which can be glossed “not influenced by considerations of personal advantage”, is a good example. Whenever I hear it nowadays, it is being used instead to mean “uninterested, lacking in interest”. That’s a shame, you could argue: disinterest is a useful concept, a way (hopefully) to talk about public servants and judges. If the distinction is being lost, won’t that harm our ability to communicate? Except that, of course, there are many other ways to say disinterested: unbiased, impartial, neutral, having no skin in the game, without an axe to grind. If this word disappeared tomorrow, we would be no less able to describe probity and even-handedness in public life. Not only that, but if most people don’t use it properly, then the word itself has become ineffective. Words cannot really be said to have an existence beyond their common use. There is no perfect dictionary in the sky with meanings that are consistent and clearly defined: real-world dictionaries are constantly trying to catch up with the “common definition” of a word.</p>
<p>But here’s the clincher: disinterested, as in “not interested”, has actually been around for a long time. The blogger Jonathon Owen cites the Oxford English dictionary as providing evidence that “both meanings have existed side by side from the 1600s. So there’s not so much a present confusion of the two words as a continuing, three-and-a-half-century-long confusion.”</p>
<p>So what is it that drives the language conservationists? Younger people tend to be the ones who innovate in all aspects of life: fashion, music, art. Language is no different. Children are often the agents of reanalysis, reinterpreting ambiguous structures as they learn the language. Young people move about more, taking innovations with them into new communities. Their social networks are larger and more dynamic. They are more likely to be early adopters of new technology, becoming familiar with the terms used to describe them. At school, on campus or in clubs and pubs, groups develop habits, individuals move between them, and language change is the result.</p>
<p>What this means, crucially, is that older people experience greater linguistic disorientation. Though we are all capable of adaptation, many aspects of the way we use language, including stylistic preferences, have solidified by our 20s. If you are in your 50s, you may identify with many aspects of the way people spoke 30-45 years ago.</p>
<p>This is what the author Douglas Adams had to say about technology. Adapted slightly, it could apply to language, too:</p>
<p>– Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</p>
<p>– Anything that’s invented between when you’re 15 and 35 is new and exciting and revolutionary.</p>
<p>– Anything invented after you’re 35 is against the natural order of things.</p>
<p>Based on that timescale, formal, standard language is about 25 years behind the cutting edge. But if change is constant, why do we end up with a standard language at all? Well, think about the institutions that define standard language: universities, newspapers, broadcasters, the literary establishment. They are mostly controlled by middle-aged people. Their dialect is the dialect of power – and it means that everything else gets assigned a lower status. Deviations might be labelled cool, or creative, but because people generally fear or feel threatened by changes they do not understand, they are more likely to be called bad, lazy or even dangerous. This is where the “standards are slipping” narrative moves into more unpleasant territory. It’s probably OK to deviate from the norm if you are young – as long as you are also white and middle-class. If you are from a group with fewer social advantages, even the forms that your parents use are likely to be stigmatised. Your innovations will be doubly condemned.</p>
<p>The irony is, of course, that the pedants are the ones making the mistakes. To people who know how language works, pundits such as Douglas Rushkoff only end up sounding ignorant, having failed to really interrogate their views. What they are expressing are stylistic preferences – and that’s fine. I have my own, and can easily say “I hate the way this is written”, or even “this is badly written”. But that is shorthand: what is left off is “in my view” or “according to my stylistic preferences and prejudices, based on what I have been exposed to up to now, and particularly between the ages of five and 25”.</p>
<p>Behemoth, bully, thief: how the English language is taking over the planet Read more</p>
<p>Mostly, pedants do not admit this. I know, because I have had plenty of arguments with them. They like to maintain that their prejudices are somehow objective – that there are clear instances of language getting “less good” in a way that can be independently verified. But, as we have seen, that is what pedants have said throughout history. George Orwell, a towering figure in politics, journalism and literature, was clearly wrong when he imagined that language would become decadent and “share in the general collapse” of civilisation unless hard work was done to repair it. Maybe it was only conscious and deliberate effort to arrest language change that was responsible for all the great poetry and rhetoric in the generation that followed him – the speeches “I have a dream” and “We choose to go to the moon”, the poetry of Seamus Heaney or Sylvia Plath, the novels of William Golding, Iris Murdoch, John Updike and Toni Morrison. More likely, Orwell was just mistaken.</p>
<p>The same is true of James Beattie, Jonathan Swift, George Puttenham, John Cheke and Ranulf Higden. The difference is that they didn’t have the benefit of evidence about the way language changes over time, unearthed by linguists from the 19th century onwards. Modern pedants don’t have that excuse. If they are so concerned about language, you have to wonder, why haven’t they bothered to get to know it a little better?</p>
<p>Adapted from Don’t Believe a Word: The Surprising Truth About Language by David Shariatmadari, published by W&amp;N on 22 August and available at guardianbookshop.co.uk. Also available as an unabridged audio edition from Orion Audio</p>

<h3 id="a-warning-by-anonymous-5-takeaways">&ldquo;‘A Warning’ by ‘Anonymous’: 5 Takeaways&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/08/us/politics/08dc-takeaways/08dc-takeaways-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
For President Trump, leaks are maddening and anonymity is infuriating. So the release of “A Warning,” the new book by “Anonymous,” an unidentified senior official in the Trump administration who first wrote about the current White House in an opinion article in The New York Times, did not make for a good Friday for the president.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways about what the book shows — and about what it doesn’t.</p>
<p>The picture it paints of the president and the White House is bleak, but not new.</p>
<p>“The White House, quite simply, is broken,” the author says at one point. At another, the author writes that the president often acts on his impulses, even when he’s been talked out of them, whether it’s in relation to policy matters or possibly dismissing a staff member.</p>
<p>“His cyclical urges can’t be suppressed for long,” the author writes.</p>
<p>His lack of interest in other branches of government is a constant theme.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about Congress,” he is supposed to have told an aide. “Just do what you need to do.”</p>
<p>These ideas don’t tread new ground — the themes were hit on, in more elaborate detail, in books by Michael Wolff and Bob Woodward earlier in the Trump presidency. Both writers painted the Trump presidency as aberrant and potentially dangerous, with detailed scenes describing actions by the president.

Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It’s No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way, revealing their secret to making it work. (Answers are edited for context and space.)</p>
<p>Who Vicky Tsai, 41, and Eric Bevan, 42.</p>
<p>Occupations They are the founders of Tatcha, a skin-care company. They remain with the company after recently selling it to Unilever.</p>
<p>Their Marriage 15 years, 5 months and counting.</p>
<p>Through the Years</p>
<p>The couple married before 94 guests on May 29, 2004, in the Gamble Mansion, a small brownstone event space in Boston. “Three friends played the guitar and sang “Fools Rush In” as we walked down the aisle,” said Ms. Tsai. “The tailor botched my wedding dress so I wore a sample from a random designer, which was cut too low. I was fine about getting married but really nervous about showing too much skin.”

<p>Julia Ormond plays Julia Day</p>
<p>Who is Julia Day? A wealthy woman who finds herself alone on her 60th birthday, having recently split from her husband of 35 years after he had an affair with her best friend.</p>
<p>She arranges a fancy dinner in London with her three children to celebrate her milestone birthday, but these plans fall apart when all three of them cancel on her at the last minute. Upset and alone, she ventures out to the museum where she once worked as a cultivator and it’s there that she meets a mysterious stranger named Benjamin Greene.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that she’s 30 years older than him, a romance between the two quickly develops – although Benjamin’s true intentions remain unclear.</p>
<p>What else has Julia Ormond been in? Recently, she played the role of Ruth Wilcox in BBC One’s period drama Howard’s End, but has also appeared in Mad Men, Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent and cult fantasy series Witches of East End. She also starred as Gone With The Wind actress Vivien Leigh in 2011’s My Week With Marilyn, and won an Emmy award for her role in HBO’s original film Temple Grandin.</p>
<p>Ben Barnes plays Benjamin Greene</p>
<p>Who is Benjamin Greene? An enigmatic younger man who Julia meets in a museum. He is instantly taken with Julia and asks her out on a date which marks the beginning of a whirlwind romance.</p>
<p>However, he is coy about his past which leads Julia’s three children to be suspicious of his true identity and motivations.</p>
<p>What else has Ben Barnes been in? He broke out as the title character in the second Chronicles of Narnia film, Prince Caspian, reprising the role for its 2010 sequel Voyage of the Dawn Treader. More recently, he has starred as the villainous Jigsaw in Netflix’s Marvel comic book adaptation The Punisher, as well as Logan Delos on HBO’s big-budget sci-fi drama Westworld.</p>
<p>Sebastian Armesto plays Patrick Day</p>
<p>Who is Patrick Day? Julia’s eldest son who works in London for a successful law firm. He and his wife, Eimear (Yasmine Akram), have recently had a baby but the newborn has put a strain on their relationship and the spark between them seems to be fading.</p>
<p>He cancels on his mother’s dinner plans due to the demands of his busy job, where he’s frequently distracted by growing feelings for his assistant, Heidi (Katie Clarkson-Hill). However, he’s resentful of his father for being unfaithful and doesn’t want to treat his wife the same way.</p>
<p>What else has Sebastian Armesto been in? Armesto played DI Taramelli in the latest series of Silent Witness which aired on BBC One at the beginning of the year. He also appeared in the final series of ITV’s acclaimed crime drama Broadchurch.</p>
<p>Archie Renaux plays Leo Day</p>
<p>Who is Leo Day? Julia’s youngest son and a lazy, disinterested slacker. He completely forgets his mother’s birthday despite being the only of her three children to still live at home.</p>
<p>He has a job in a local pub but takes as few shifts as possible, opting instead to live off his mother’s handouts and good will. He’s selfish and generally distant with the rest of his family, but finds his mother’s relationship with a much younger man just as worrying as his siblings do. If only because he fears losing his inheritance.</p>
<p>What else has Archie Renaux been in? He’s a relative newcomer with few acting credits to his name, but has previously appeared in the second episode of Amazon Prime’s thriller series Hanna. Renaux may become more established next year, with roles in major projects like the Marvel Comics adaptation Morbius, and the upcoming Netflix fantasy series Shadow and Bone.</p>
<p>Jemima Rooper plays Della Day</p>
<p>Who is Della Day? Julia’s only daughter who can’t attend her mother’s birthday meal after a cancelled flight leaves her stranded abroad.</p>
<p>She is less sceptical about Benjamin than her siblings, pointing out that their mother is happy again after a difficult separation and suggesting they all be supportive. Although, her willingness to give love a chance might be partly influenced by her own recent experience with heartbreak…</p>
<p>What else has Jemima Rooper been in? She’s been popping up on a number of crime shows in the last few years, including Silent Witness, Father Brown and Death in Paradise. She also starred as the mythological being Medusa in Atlantis, which ran for two series on BBC One.</p>
<p>Alex Jennings plays Ted Day</p>
<p>Who is Ted Day? Julia’s ex-husband who cheated on her after 35 years of marriage with her best friend, Marsha.</p>
<p>Since the truth came out about his infidelity, Ted has avoided contact with Julia and focused solely on his new relationship with Marsha. His coldness towards his ex-wife is a point of contention, with Patrick being particularly angry about how poorly he has treated her.</p>
<p>What else has Alex Jennings been in? Jennings has a career spanning decades across theatre, film and television. Recently, he has starred alongside Hugh Grant in the Amazon Prime miniseries A Very English Scandal, as well as the third series of crime drama Unforgotten. His specialty seems to be playing royalty, having taken on the roles of Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor (The Crown), King Leopold I (Victoria) and Prince Charles (The Queen).</p>
<p>Nikki Amuka-Bird plays Marsha</p>
<p>Who is Marsha? Following the discovery of their affair, Marsha is now in a relationship with Ted but it killed the close friendship she once had with Julia. Marsha would like them to reconcile their differences, but Julia refuses to speak to her.</p>
<p>What else has Nikki Amuka-Bird been in? She had a leading role in the BBC’s pre-apocalypse drama Hard Sun, and played Detective Chief Inspector Erin Grey on Luther (starring Idris Elba). Most recently, she has been seen on Netflix in crime drama The Laundromat, directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep.</p>
<p>Julia McKenzie plays Hazel Day</p>
<p>BBC/Mainstreet Pictures/Laurence Cendrowicz</p>
<p>Who is Hazel Day? Hazel is Ted’s elderly mother who Julia still takes time to visit despite the breakdown of their marriage. She strongly disapproves of her son’s infidelity.</p>
<p>What else has Julia McKenzie been in? Acting since the mid-1960s, McKenzie has a prolific body of work behind her. As a two-time Olivier award winner, she is an accomplished theatre actress – however most people will recognise her as Miss Marple, a role she played from 2008-2013 in ITV’s adaptation of the Agatha Christie stories.</p>
