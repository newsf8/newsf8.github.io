If you need to take a Chatham Area Transit bus, you won’t have to pay for it right now. Starting Thursday, March 26, CAT is waiving all fare collection to help reduce the amount of contact between riders and drivers. It’s also to give relief to people who might be without a source of income right now.

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fLeQiT3nPvqG-AeIaqUHL0azqVQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D4E753TO3II6VMKI4THD7PMFWU.jpg" alt="img">
Even if February is the shortest month, this one couldn’t end soon enough. Tom and I started practicing social distancing before it became a part of everyone’s life. My cold had lasted for the first half of it, and Tom’s the second. Meanwhile, there were the stresses of moving. I’d spent the better part of the month clearing out my 94-year-old mother’s apartment. We had recently moved her to an assisted-living facility that, fortunately, she loves. I had hoped March would bring a blessed turnaround. But, before that could happen, on Feb. 27 my mother received some very bad news about her health [nothing related to the coronavirus]. Then, on a confounded extra day known as leap day, my cat disappeared. Fifteen years ago, my father and my cat died two months apart. I was terrified that the situation was repeating itself. We had to find Moki.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Tom and I were unsure how to track him at night. I didn’t panic but went inside and scoured the Internet for ideas. There were tips about creating posters and notifying shelters. I had used them all before, because this wasn’t my escape artist’s first foray into the outside world. I’d adopted Moki when I lived in the Los Angeles area, long before I met Tom. Our interspecies family moved back to my native Maryland from California three years ago to assist my mother.</p>
<p>My cat, in his youth, had pushed out a screen from my second-story North Hollywood apartment while I slept. That time, I spent a week on a feverish search in 100-degree heat. My California neighbors got to know me so well that when I tried handing a flier about my missing feline to a little girl and her dad, the girl said “Moki, right?,” letting me know she had already seen my posters on every bulletin board and utility pole within a mile. It paid off when, after many purported sightings by neighbors, the woman right next door spotted him and helped me nab the little rascal as he stood loudly meowing in the enclosed parking lot behind her apartment building.</p>
<p>Now, given the late hour, plastering my Rockville neighborhood with posters wasn’t going to help. And all of the animal control centers in our area were closed. Temperatures were dropping to the mid-20s In desperation, I called my former hometown and talked to Los Angeles Animal Control Officer Angela Llerenas. She warned us that, if Moki were nearby, leaving lights on outside might attract a predator that could hurt him. She suggested we put out boxes filled with our clothes so he would smell us, and that we leave his litter box outside. We followed all of her directions. Then Tom and I roamed our neighborhood again, still with no luck.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Exhausted, we went back inside, and I began collecting Moki photos for a poster to run online. Though it was 1:30 a.m., sleep seemed impossible. So, I made one last search nearby. I circled our house, and just as I was about to call it a night, I saw Moki’s tail! Probably because it was twice its usual size from fear. He let out an earthshaking howl. I had read that missing cats can be so scared they will bolt, so I got low to the ground and talked to him quietly. That seemed to relax him. I scooped him up, took him inside and proceeded to sob uncontrollably, refusing to let him go until his fur warmed. He is a cat who isn’t fond of being held for long, but he willingly allowed it this once.</p>
<p>After I calmed down, I called Llerenas to thank her and let her know that her cross-country guidance had helped bring my cat home. I could not be more grateful that a city employee from my former hometown provided the expert input that probably saved Moki’s life — along with rescuing me from overwhelming anxiety.</p>
<p>Because of Llerenas, the same scenario from 15 years ago wouldn’t replay itself this year. And finding Moki gave me hope that my mom can survive her diagnosis and fulfill a destiny she began declaring when she was in her 50s. “I’m going to live to be 100,” she has repeatedly told us. With a passion for life as strong as Mom has, and with an improved diagnosis after additional tests, I very much hope that she surpasses her goal of living to 100 in good health. But, no matter what challenges our family faces as we support Mom’s pursuit of well-being, I can curl up for many more nights with Moki beside me, thanks to the kindness and expertise of a city employee on the other side of the country who helped us on a frightening February evening.

<h3 id="new-study-of-900-house-cats-finally-answers-age-old-question-about-what-felines-do-when-they-go-outside">New Study of 900 House Cats Finally Answers Age-Old Question About What Felines Do When They Go Outside</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Outside-Cat-2-National-Geographic-Youtube-Screenshot.jpg" alt="img">
Have you ever wondered where our pet cats go when we’re not looking? What mysterious antics they get up to when they’re prowling around the great outdoors? And will we ever understand the inner mysteries of the noble cat mind?</p>
<p>In an effort to answer these ancient questions, which have plagued the minds of cat-fanciers since the time of the Pharaohs, one team of scientists launched an initiative to track the movements of our feline friends and glean some insight into their outdoor lives.</p>
<p>The Cat Tracker Project is simple in concept: find out where cats go and what they do. Founded by researchers from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, the team placed GPS collars on the cats of willing volunteers.</p>
<p>After tracking the movements and behavior of nearly 1,000 cats across four countries and analyzing the data for six years, the results are in—and some of the findings come as a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>LOOK: This Epic Pirate Cat Has Spent Her Whole Life Sailing the Ocean</p>
<p>“I was surprised at how little these cats moved,” lead project author Roland Kays told National Geographic. “Most of them spent all their time within 100 meters [330 feet] of their yard.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say that all cats were layabouts, however. National Geographic’s Jonathan Losos goes on to note: “Seven percent covered more than 25 acres, and several cats had enormous ranges. The record-setter was Penny, a young female from the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand, who roamed over the hills behind her house, covering an area greater than three square miles.”</p>
<p>Then there was Max, a neutered tomcat from England who walked from his home village of St. Newlyn East all the way to Trevilson—over a mile—and back for no apparent reason. Max made this trek twice in the six days he was tracked, leaving his human as mystified as the researchers.</p>

<p>If you have an outdoor cat, reading some of these anecdotes might confirm something you’ve long suspected: that the inner machinations of a cat’s mind are an unknowable enigma—a felicitous riddle whose answer they themselves might not possess.</p>
<p>On the other hand, don’t let the tales of adventurous ramblers worry you—the study found that the vast majority of cats are, simply put, “universally lazy”, according to Kays. Aloof though their personalities may seem, chances are our furry companions are strolling just outside our own backyards, and not farther.</p>
<p>However, the Cat Tracker Project doesn’t end there. If have you ever wanted to understand your cat’s personality, the project’s website explains: “With help from our colleagues at Discovery Circle in Australia, we know that there are 5 overarching traits in feline personality, aptly named the ‘Feline Five’. They consist of Skittishness, Outgoingness, Spontaneity, Dominance and Friendliness. The results are calculated on a scale, showing how much your cat exhibits characteristics in each of the Feline Five traits.”</p>

<p>The Cat Tracker Project also has a branch of their work that studies how much pet cats hunt local birds and mammals for sport. By analyzing hair and food samples from participants, researchers can learn about whether a particular cat is “snacking beyond the food bowl”. While this might seem merely like an unsavory side-effect of cat ownership, recent research actually indicates that free-ranging domestic cats in the United States alone kill up to 4 billion birds and 22 billion mammals each year. That could be over three times the population of human beings on planet Earth!</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that the staggering number of birds killed by pet cats has led an intrepid kitty-owner to take action. In 2018, GNN covered a story about a cat mom named Nancy Brennan who had become increasingly frustrated by how many birds regularly fell prey to her pet cat George—and she became determined to stop him from hunting birds by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Upon reading an article about how birds tend to take notice of bright colors, Brennan created a rainbow kitty collar for George to wear. Its vibrant hues alerted nearby birds to the cat’s presence, and shortly after, she was delighted to find that George had stopped killing birds.</p>

<p>Her “Birds Be Safe” collar ended up being so anecdotally effective for other pet owners that an ornithologist and professor at St. Lawrence University, S.K. Wilson, decided to run a 12-week scientific study on its success. Wilson’s study proved that cats killed 19 times fewer birds when wearing one of Brennan’s bright collars. The study brought a flood of new traffic to Brennan’s collar-selling site, which now distributes its bird-saving devices to cat parents all across the world—not to mention the stylish flair that the collars give their cats.</p>
