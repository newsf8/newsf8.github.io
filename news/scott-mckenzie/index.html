Telford Tigers have announced the return of Scott McKenzie for the 2020/21 season.</p>

<p>McKenzie will return for his ninth year with the Tigers and will wear his trademark number 77 shirt. McKenzie was the team’s top scorer with 72 points last season and will be a key player in the roster for next season.</p>
<p>Scott will also be taking on a new role within the club as Head Coach of the Tigers 2 team. McKenzie will oversee all team matters for the NIHL Division 2 club, but will hand over the reigns on match days to the Tigers 2 Assistant Coach, who is soon be announced.</p>
<p>Scott said: “It’s great to be re-signing for Telford Tigers for the 2020/21 season. Last year, as everyone knows, was an extremely successful season for the club and I feel really privileged to have been a part of that. I built great chemistry with Brandon (Whistle) and Rick (Plant) towards the end of the season which made my decision to come back really easy.</p>
<p>“When you’re enjoying your hockey, you don’t want it to end. It was a shame the way the season finished but safety for the players, staff, volunteers and fans was obviously the most important thing. If we can put together a similar team, I feel like we can continue to be competing for trophies and there is no other club I want to win trophies with.”</p>
<p>On being appointed Tigers 2 Head Coach, McKenzie stated, “I’m really excited to get started with Telford Tigers 2. I’ve taken a step back from coaching in a senior capacity since leaving Deeside Dragons a few years ago to concentrate fully on playing, but I feel like this was an opportunity not to be missed. I want to help continue the pathway for juniors to make the step into senior hockey but our main goal has to be to challenge for silverware. There’s a lot of work ahead, especially due to the current Covid-19 situation and when hockey will return, but I’m relishing the challenge.”</p>
<p>Tom Watkins, Head Coach and General Manager, said, “I couldn’t be happier in welcoming Scott back for another season. Firstly, let me congratulate Scott and his partner Clarice on the birth of their daughter in April. It was a wonderful moment for both of them. Scott was one of the first guys I signed when I began coaching the Tigers over 10 years ago and I’ve got to say he’s up there as one of the best signings I’ve made. His on ice performances are there for all to see, he contributes in every department 5 on 5, face offs, power play and penalty kill; penalty shots, 3 on 3, scores big goals, is an accomplished shot blocker and keeps getting better and better each season. That’s the stuff most people see, but it’s also the person behind all of that, that goes into making him such an important signing. His attitude and character are first class, he has a love for the game which is one thing but his passion for the club, for Telford Tigers is unquestionable. He’s an extremely humble guy, has a lot of time for everyone and pays it forward more than most. He gives up his spare time to help coach and support young hockey players at various levels and supports charity events where he can. In the time I’ve known him, he’s someone who I talk to regularly and bounce ideas about games and players off. He’s shares my desire for the team to be successful, his knowledge of the game is first class, he is very coachable and a leader for his teammates. What I really like about Scott is that he cares, he cares about his teammates and the club and that shows an excellent example in my book.”</p>
<p>Watkins also commented on the appointment of McKenzie as Tigers 2 Head Coach, “I think this is a great addition to our coaching team. Scott brings a wealth of playing experience and has an excellent knowledge of the game from which to influence the team. He’s a very keen and passionate coach, having coached at different levels of junior and senior hockey along with various conference teams. This is a return to a coaching role he has done previously, he will oversee all coaching matters concerned with the team as he did in the past with the exception of game days if there is a clash with the National League Team. This will give the club excellent continuity between the National League team and the Laidler Division team. Scott is very familiar with how I work, with regard to strategies and systems. This will allow the teams to share similar philosophies and identity, but of course Scott will bring his own ideas and personal characteristics to the role. I’m excited to support him build a group and then watch him mould them into a competitive team.”</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-caused-food-prices-to-skyrocket">&ldquo;Coronavirus caused food prices to skyrocket&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png" alt="img">
Food prices have reached record highs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Prices for food bought in stores increased 1 percent over the month of May and 4.8 percent during the past year, the highest it’s been in nearly a decade since 2012 when prices increased by 5.3 percent, according to the most recent statistics from the Labor Department.</p>
<p>What’s more, food prices increased 5.8 percent between March 1 and May 30, compared with the same time a year ago, according to Market-research firm Nielsen.</p>
<p>Because of the constrained supply chain, retailers have struggled to keep products on the shelf, and as a result, they’ve pulled back on the number of promotional offers, Scott McKenzie, global intelligence leader at Nielsen, told FOX Business Wednesday.</p>
<p>“This has led to higher prices that shoppers are paying, particularly in the earlier periods of the pandemic,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>FOOD PRICES SEE HISTORIC JUMP AND ARE LIKELY TO STAY HIGH</p>
<p>The price of steaks, ribs and pork roasts are up 10 percent and whole chicken is up 7 percent, according to the latest stats from the Consumer Price Index.</p>
<p>COSTCO PLANS TO BRING BACK FREE FOOD SAMPLES</p>
<p>Beef and pork plants were running at around 60 percent capacity by mid-May. And while that number has since increased to almost 90 percent, economists say a second wave of COVID-19 could make it much worse for production.</p>
<p>As a result, analysts say eaters can expect food prices to continue to escalate as company costs continue to be passed on to consumers.</p>

<h3 id="office-rents-may-fall-as-business-rethink-their-space-needs">&ldquo;Office rents may fall as business rethink their space needs&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/y/m/l/d/3/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.20gasl.png/1591316296180.jpg" alt="img">
The success of lockdown has prompted many businesses to rethink their space needs.</p>
<p>Many businesses struggling to pay both wages and rents are predicted to pull out of their current office spaces when their leases fall due.</p>
<p>Building consultancy Hampton Jones says some businesses will simply fail if they can&rsquo;t reduce their overheads, and landlords might have to drop rent or be flexible in other ways if tenants start downsizing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t afford it, you can&rsquo;t afford it so you need to find some way of making it work,&rsquo;&rsquo; managing director Brian Jones says.</p>
<p>He says the success of staff working from home over lockdown showed many businesses that the traditional 9-to-5 way of working can be &lsquo;&lsquo;incredibly expensive&rsquo;'.</p>

<p>Coronavirus: Hot desking and co-working spaces unlikely to make the cut, experts say</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coronavirus: What can we expect from post-Covid-19 office spaces?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With social distancing requiring many desks to go empty at present, he expects shared spaces and remote working to become more regular, and businesses to review whether they had too big a footprint.</p>
<p>Some office building owners may also have to consider alternatives. &lsquo;&lsquo;I was speaking to one owner who&rsquo;s thinking of converting some of their office space into residential.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other landlords may have to meet the market by reducing rent, or allowing tenants to sublet some space.</p>
<p>UNSPLASH Working from home is not practical for all office workers.</p>
<p>But there is still a place for offices, Jones believes. Some businesses will stay in the CBD because &lsquo;&lsquo;there is kudos in that&rsquo;&rsquo; with their clients.</p>
<p>Plus working from home does not suit some workers who still need training or supervision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Zoom, for example, has been great but it is quite stale, you don&rsquo;t get that human interaction which is really important. So I don&rsquo;t think there will be a need to get rid of offices altogether but I definitely think there&rsquo;s an opportunity for working differently.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>While some businesses may want to pull out of a lease, Jones says commercial property leases are not generally very flexible and landlords are well within their rights to enforce it if a tenant defaults.</p>
<p>He advises businesses to get legal advice on their obligations. &lsquo;&lsquo;There can often be hidden costs and liabilities that need to be carefully considered as part of any decision making.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He also urges tenants to engage with their landlord in good faith. Many landlords had found during 2008&rsquo;s global financial crisis that it was better to get some income than not at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;For example, your landlord may be willing to find you alternative smaller space within their building.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>123RF Staff still need to rub shoulders for businesses to function best, Jones and McKenzie say.</p>
<p>Scott McKenzie, of unlisted fund PMG Property Funds Management, agrees that while Covid-19 and the work from home phenomenon will have an impact, workers will still need to come together at times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Physical interaction is a catalyst for innovation, creativity and knowledge transfer,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>He says the trend towards letting staff partially work from home was well in train before Covid-19, and progressive businesses will continue letting staff enjoy both worlds.</p>
<p>Falling rents can affect the value of a building, with ramifications for investors. With the market is in flux, &lsquo;McKenzie says &lsquo;&lsquo;often people will put their hands in their pockets and wait and see&rsquo;'.</p>
<p>Valuers found it difficult to put a value on properties at the end of the March financial year, especially for properties linked to tourism, hospitality and retail.</p>
<p>But at times like these, McKenzie says the market usually sees a &lsquo;&lsquo;flight to quality,&rsquo;&rsquo; and certain properties do better if they have solid tenants. At the moment, that&rsquo;s the Government, telco, professional or essential service sectors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Industrial properties have held up and actually improved, as have quite a lot of office properties.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;For example, within our office portfolio, we had a portfolio valuation gain in March 31 in the last year by 5.4 per cent so the share value went from $1.12 to $1.18. So it&rsquo;s dangerous to suggest the whole sector will be impacted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Certainly, segments will have a degree of impact, and particularly secondary property where we have obviously tenants that are perhaps more exposed to this economic downturn or smaller balance sheets, or don&rsquo;t have business models with the wherewithal to get through.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>SUPPLIED The upside for the office sector is that there is not a lot of new space on the market, Scott McKenzie says.</p>
<p>A saving grace for the office sector is that there are not many new buildings being finished off, McKenzie says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;There has been a lot of space taken out of supply and converted to accommodation over recent years and we haven&rsquo;t been inundated with new supply of office property.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Yes in Auckland, we&rsquo;ve got Commercial Bay and a few others being built, but if you think back over the last six to eight months, there hasn&rsquo;t been a huge amount of additional supply coming on the market.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with a slowdown forecast for the construction sector, that situation is likely to remain.</p>
<p>However, McKenzie says new office projects will hang in the balance because they rely on confidence from market and also the banks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Liquidity, bank funding, is getting harder to access and that will slow down any developments building more offices in the short-to-medium term at least.&rsquo;&rsquo;

<p>Resilience needed in face of change</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank says the commercial property sector is vulnerable to the Covid-19 crisis. But PMG Funds&rsquo; chief executive believes that while there’ll be short-term pain, the biggest long-term impact will be structural change.</p>
<p>Thursday, May 28th 2020, 1:04PM</p>
<p>by Miriam Bell</p>
<p>PMG Funds chief executive Scott McKenzie</p>
<p>In its latest Financial Stability Report (FSR), which was released Wednesday, the Reserve Bank says commercial property – especially accommodation, hospitality, retail, and some office properties – was immediately affected by Covid-19 prompted travel restrictions and the alert level four measures.</p>
<p>“Many property owners have proactively offered rent reductions to support tenants during the downturn, but a prolonged economic slump will put downward pressure on rents and lead to increases in vacancy rates.”</p>
<p>The report says current development pipelines also indicate that an above-average volume of retail and accommodation space is due to be delivered over the next year in the Auckland and Queenstown markets</p>
<p>“Demand may therefore struggle to keep pace with this increased supply, and the viability of some commercial property loans will be called into question.”</p>
<p>While the tightening of lending requirements for the sector mean the problems it faces are unlikely to threaten financial stability on their own, the report says that could exacerbate the downturn and weaken the financial system’s resilience.</p>
<p>However, PMG Funds chief executive Scott McKenzie says that while the Covid-19 crisis is unprecedented and has presented major challenges for commercial landlords and the businesses who are their tenants, long-term it is a bump on the road.</p>
<p>He thinks the industry has responded pretty well to the crisis, with most businesses and landlords managing to work together to find a solution to help them get through - despite confusion around the ‘no access’ clause in many leases.</p>
<p>“We have 250 tenants, made up of a combination of small, medium and large businesses, across our portfolio and we want them to stay long-term. We were willing to share the pain and so we came up with packages targeted for each of our tenants and we’ve now finalised discussions with 90% of them.</p>
<p>“Most landlords would have been done the same and negotiated agreements which are fair and reasonable for their situation. It hasn’t been easy though because it is not just a commercial discussion, it is also an ethical and moral discussion.”</p>
<p>They expected to see the loss of about one month of rent across their portfolio, yet the impact has been below that, McKenzie says.</p>
<p>“A lot of our tenants have proved to be resilient. But our portfolio is geared more towards office and industrial properties, so we have less than 8% exposure to tourism, hospitality and/or retail. That makes a difference as investors with heavy exposure to those areas are likely to be suffering.”</p>
<p>Going forward, he doesn’t see the Covid-19 crisis as dealing a king-hit to New Zealand’s commercial property sector.</p>
<p>One supportive factor is that there were some residual low vacancy rates going into the crisis, he says. For example, in the Auckland CBD office space, the vacancy rate pre-Covid was 6%, as compared to the pre-GFC rate of 14%. Likewise in Christchurch, the rate was 10% pre-GFC but 5% pre-Covid.</p>
<p>“This leaves the commercial sector in a reasonably strong place in terms of capacity to absorb the shock. It’s a better situation than during the GFC. Also, in the industrial/logistics sector, the capacity is even tighter as there was even less vacant supply around pre-Covid.”</p>
<p>Real estate – whether commercial or residential – goes in cycles and the commercial property sector’s journey to growth will continue, but there will be some major structural changes ahead, McKenzie says.</p>
<p>One big change will be with retail property as there will be much more interaction online. That means high-street retailers might need to rethink their business model, but it will good for industrial/logistics property.</p>
<p>Another big structural change is likely to come in the office space. McKenzie says lockdown was the biggest global remote working experiment the world has ever seen and it will have an impact on the office property sector.</p>
<p>“Some of the existing trends in that space have now sped up. In particular, flexible and remote working. There will be differences around health and safety protocols, especially short-term. We’ll see much less of things like hot-desking and there will be questions around the best, most effective use of space.”</p>
<p>But office property in central locations has been round for hundreds of years and that’s not going to change, he says.</p>
<p>“Offices exist to bring people together to facilitate interaction and collaboration. There’s still a need to for spaces to do that because they enable creativity, innovation and the transfer of know how. It’s harder to achieve these things in remote working environments, even with the help of technology.</p>
<p>“So I think offices are here to stay but the way people come together for work and how they work might change a bit. Office property and the way it is used will evolve. The spaces will be designed to be more efficient and to better enables the work and the culture.”</p>
<p>For investors, the way forward is all about cash flow, the resilience of their portfolio and their tenants, and also making the most of any opportunities to enhance their portfolio, in McKenzie’s view.</p>
<p>At PMG, they have been thinking hard about the future of real estate and the trends that they are seeing and they will continue to review their portfolio accordingly, he says.</p>
<p>“It is about anticipating changes. So that we are able to expand our real estate assets, and improve the quality of our portfolio, in a way that is right, not just in the current market but for the long-term. It is all about the value add – and resilience. That is our mandate.”</p>
<p>To that end, PMG has just announced its latest investment offer: its office fund is acquiring the Vodafone Innov8 office in the Christchurch CBD.*</p>
<p>McKenzie says the acquisition is not about trying to pick up deals at the bottom of the cycle. “It is all about the asset which is one that we think will add value to our portfolio long-term.”</p>

<h3 id="how-the-pandemic-may-change-the-way-we-grocery-shop">&ldquo;How the pandemic may change the way we grocery shop&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106454600-1584739198648gettyimages-1207671948.jpg?v=1589559114" alt="img">
Gone are the days of leisurely browsing the aisles of grocery stores. Instead, customers are getting used to new grocery store fixtures: Mask-wearing employees, plexiglass barriers at cash registers, one-way aisles and antibacterial wipe dispensers. Some of those will become the norm. Others will fade away as coronavirus cases decline. But many analysts predict the pandemic will change how customers stock their fridges and pantries and shape their expectations in the months or years ahead. Here&rsquo;s a round-up of five changes sparked by the pandemic:</p>
<p>No touching, please</p>

<p>Customers are more squeamish about germs — and that could linger. Grocers and other retailers have touted new and expanded contactless approaches to shop or check out. Walmart, for example, added a new feature to its smartphone app that allows customers to scan a QR code instead of touching a screen at the cash register. Other apps, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, also allow customers to skip the credit card reader. With curbside pickup, customers can pop the trunk instead of going into stores. Some retailers have waived the need for a signature when people pick up groceries or get a delivery to their home. Some customers are opting for prepackaged goods, as they skip the deli counter and other parts of the store with additional food handling, said Jill Standish, Accenture&rsquo;s global head of retail. She said the grab-and-go items also shorten shoppers&rsquo; time in stores, another common preference. Those approaches may stick because of their convenience, along with heightened safety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go local&rsquo; trend on steroids</p>

<p>Long before the pandemic, customers bought fruits and vegetables at farmers markets and supported local businesses, such as cheese shops. The pandemic is accelerating that trend, said Scott McKenzie, Nielsen&rsquo;s head of global intelligence. Now, he said, people gravitate even more to products grown or made closer to home. They&rsquo;re thinking about the long distances that produce, meat and other foods may travel and the borders they may cross before arriving to their kitchen table — and the many people who may touch them along the way. That&rsquo;s driving more interest in subscriptions to farm boxes and items with &ldquo;a shorter supply chain,&rdquo; McKenzie said. &ldquo;I call this the phenomenon of buying milk from cows you can see,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Shift to online shopping accelerates</p>

<p>Grocery shoppers have downloaded new grocery apps and tried new online services. Those discoveries have shaken up habits and could lead to a meaningful shift in an industry that&rsquo;s been slow to go digital. Customers have used third-party delivery services, such as Instacart, FreshDirect and Target-owned Shipt, to get groceries. They&rsquo;ve also ordered online and used curbside or in-store pickup at Walmart and Target. Only about 3% or 4% of grocery spending in the U.S. was online before the coronavirus outbreak, according to research by consulting firm Bain &amp; Company. That could increase to between 5% and 10% after it, said Steve Caine, a retail expert and partner for the firm.</p>

<p>Grocers will look for creative ways to strengthen relationships with customers and entice them to add more to their virtual baskets, as more customers shop online in addition to in-store. Employees who fulfill and bag online orders at stores — often called pickers or shoppers — will become increasingly important and could become a competitive advantage for retailers, said Eiko Kawano, a group experience director for digital consulting firm, Publicis Sapient. Grocers may use the employees as brand ambassadors and suggestive sellers, she said. Stores could ask pickers to upload a photo or a brief profile and allow customers to rate the pickers like Uber and Lyft drivers. Through a combination of personal relationships and algorithms, the shopper or picker could personalize customers&rsquo; orders by recommending an item. And they could nudge customers towards higher margin items and discretionary purchases, too.</p>
