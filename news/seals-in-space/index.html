Chris Cassidy smiles after donning his space suit during zero gravity training at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab. The NBL is a pool that simulates zero gravity to train astronauts for upcoming missions. The NBL contains full mock-ups of the International Space Station for the astronauts to train with. Cassidy, a U.S. Navy SEAL, is a mission specialist on the upcoming mission STS-127 to the International Space Station scheduled for June of this year. see less | View Image Page</p>
<p>It is no secret that Navy SEALs, the special operations force of the U.S. Navy, are constantly striving to out-perform themselves and each other, but how far can they go? In 1984, one of them went above and beyond his teammates and made history.</p>
<p>“At the time, NASA was taking astronaut candidates who were not just pilots,” said Capt. William Shepherd, retired SEAL, and the first commander of the International Space Station. “There were candidates made up of doctors, engineers and scientists, and I looked at that and said, ‘You know I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the water in my SCUBA gear, and that&rsquo;s an awful lot like being in a space suit, so I think I’ll just apply and see what happens.’”</p>
<p>Not long after, Shepherd learned he would become a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, making him not only the first military non-aviator, but also the first Navy SEAL to go through astronaut training in U.S. history.</p>
<p>After four years of training, Shepherd embarked on the space shuttle mission STS-27 (Space Transformation System 27), and launched into space for his first time Dec.2, 1988 from the John F. Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Fla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now at a crossroads, deciding whether we are bound to inhabit only the Earth, or if humans are to live and work far from the home planet,” said Shepherd in an interview regarding the 5th anniversary of continuous life aboard the International Space Station. “Let us continue now with new explorations which are more expansive and more bold; voyages which will define us as a space-faring civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shepherd’s path to becoming an astronaut in service to the country started with Underwater Demolition Team ELEVEN, then SEAL Teams ONE and TWO, and Special Boat Unit TWENTY, all operating in the Pacific, Atlantic and European theaters.</p>
<p>Although Shepherd was standing in the ranks among the most highly trained warriors in the world, he looked towards the stars to achieve more, he wasn’t the only one. Capt. (SEAL) Chris Cassidy, a current astronaut, spent more than 10 years in the SEAL teams and was directly influenced by the previous achievements of Shepherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my experience with the SEAL teams and with going through BUD/S, it&rsquo;s given me the confidence to know I can accomplish anything that I want,” said Cassidy in an interview with U.S. Navy SEAL &amp; SWCC Page. “If you look at SEALs after their life in the teams, you’ll find people in all different sectors of industry doing all types of things. I personally always had an interest in astronauts, and I followed Capt. Shepherd&rsquo;s career and was inspired by him to be an astronaut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2004, Cassidy was selected for NASA’s Astronaut Candidate Class and joined a group of fellow explorers including pilots and engineers. Shortly after selection, he began intensive training that included land survival, T-38 jet ground and flight training, Shuttle orbiter systems training, space station systems training, science and engineering briefings and orientation tours at all NASA centers, including the Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.</p>
<p>Currently, Cassidy is in command of the International Space Station on ‘Expedition 63.’ The current mission he leads is conducting research investigations focused on biology, earth science, human research, physical sciences and technology development, as well as providing the foundation for continuing human spaceflight beyond low-earth orbit to the Moon and Mars which is central to future space exploration as part of NASA’s Artemis program.</p>
<p>The Artemis program is an ongoing U.S. government-funded crewed spaceflight program with the goal of landing &ldquo;the first woman and the next man&rdquo; on the Moon by 2024, and it is likely that a U.S. astronaut currently serving in the program will be the next American to step on the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p>It is possible that astronaut could be Lt. (SEAL) Jonny Kim.</p>
<p>In 2002, Kim decided to leave his hometown of Santa Monica, Calif. to enlist in the Navy and join the ranks of Naval Special Warfare operators.</p>
<p>“I didn’t like the person I was growing up to become. I needed to find myself and my identity,” said Kim in an interview with former SEAL, Jocko Willink. “And for me, getting out of my comfort zone, getting away from the people I grew up with, and finding adventure, that was my odyssey, and it was the best decision I ever made.”</p>
<p>After completing Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S), Kim was assigned as a Special Warfare Operator to SEAL Team THREE Charlie Platoon and served as a Special Operations Combat Medic, sniper, navigator and point man on more than 100 combat operations spanning two deployments to the Middle East including Ramadi and Sadr City, Iraq.</p>
<p>His experiences as a medic taught him about teamwork, humility and service. Upon returning home, he decided to challenge himself yet again and applied for a commissioning program that put him on the path to become a medical doctor. Kim’s application was accepted and he began his residency to Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.</p>
<p>In 2017, Kim was a resident physician in emergency medicine with Partners Healthcare at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. He finally met his goal of becoming a doctor, but he didn’t stop there. That same year, he applied to become an astronaut and was accepted, joining NASA’s team on the Artemis program.</p>
<p>“I was told that with the right attitude, and with enough hard work, if you get up after every time you fail, you can amount to something and you can do positive work. You can leave a positive mark for our world, and that&rsquo;s what I aim to do,” said Kim.</p>
<p>Kim’s unwavering perseverance led him to be the outstanding American that many call a hero, and he encourages many others to follow in his path of greatness as well.</p>
<p>“Don&rsquo;t let that hunger for the unknown go away,” said Kim. “That curiosity is so important, so you should maintain that passion for what you do. Never in a million years would I have thought I could have been an astronaut candidate. I didn&rsquo;t have the confidence from my childhood, but dreams are possible and all good things in life are hard to get, so persevere and don&rsquo;t give up!”

韓裔移民之子美國圓夢神過程</p>
<p>他18歲喪父，高中時成績頂尖，但卻沒有朋友。面對社交慘澹的高中生活，他一心想要服役，進入「海豹部隊」（SEAL）。當他告訴母親，想要從軍時，只見母親淚眼婆娑，勸他別走這條路。</p>
<p>據《商業內幕》（Business Insider）網與美國國家廣播公司新聞（NBC News）網報導，36歲的金強尼（Jonny Kim）是韓裔移民第二代。他父親成長於韓國貧困的農村，從未接受過高中以上的正規教育。然而，如今金強尼不但接受過海豹部隊特種訓練，成為哈佛醫生，更成為美國國家航太總署（NASA）認證的太空人。</p>
<p>美國德州參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）看到他輝煌的成就，直說自己簡直「遜斃了」。他在周五的NASA畢業典禮上打趣說：「真不知我們這輩子幹了什麼。」</p>
<p>金強尼的父母1980年代移民到美國，和許多加州韓國移民一樣，選擇定居在洛杉磯中南部，開了家酒品店。金強尼說，父親是典型苦幹實幹的移民工，靠努力工作來彌補教育的不足。就他記憶所及，父親一星期總是工作6天。而母親則在教養他和弟弟之餘，還在小學擔任代課老師。</p>
<p>金強尼說，由於他個性靦腆，高中午餐時間是一天中最慘的時刻之一。他最不想要別人看到的，就是沒人和他共進午餐，因此總是漫無目的，在走廊閒逛。他認為，對許多人來說，高中生活是大型社交實驗，而他也認為，那和成為好學生沒什麼關係。他自認，就社交方面而言，他是一敗塗地。不要說別人，就連他也沒料到自己未來的發展。</p>
<p>從海豹特種部隊變成哈佛醫生</p>
<p>高中時，金強尼成績傑出，畢業後上大學似乎順理成章，但他明白，自己志不在此，結果一所學校也沒申請。他說，自身缺乏自信，怕交朋友，怕和別人交談，也怕建立人際關係。而他「扮演」青少年的唯一動力，就是要進入海豹部隊。然而，當他從聖塔莫尼卡高中（Santa Monica High School）畢業告訴母親，說他想要從軍時，她卻哭道：「你那麼聰明，為什麼要那樣做？」</p>
<p>不過，金強尼心意已決，儘管母親在送他去軍營時告訴他，「還不算晚，你可以回家，我們一起經營家庭事業」。回家的念頭在他腦海中閃現，但稍縱即逝，他最後還是告訴母親，「我得這麼做」。</p>
<p>他通過海豹部隊嚴厲的考驗，兩度部署中東，擔任過戰鬥醫務員，狙擊手和領航員，目睹太多同袍在戰鬥中喪生或重傷。退役後，那些揮之不去的記憶促使他習醫。「我承諾了許多犧牲的同袍，」他說，「要是他們還活著，應該會有令人難以置信的成就。」</p>
<p>他先從聖地牙哥大學（University of San Diego）畢業，取得數學學士學位，接著進入哈佛大學醫學院（Harvard Medical School），在波士頓麻州綜合醫院（Massachusetts General Hospital）擔任住院醫師實習一年後，他就前往NASA接受太空人訓練。</p>
<p>如今金強尼通過太空人訓練，擁有超凡的履歷，成了家，有兩個小孩，似乎在人生的巔峰，不過他仍保持低調。他說，自己做了許多亞洲人不曾做的事，當他身在海豹部隊時，只要伸出一隻手，就能數得出有幾個亞裔美國人。為了打破大家對亞裔的刻板印象，他感受到內心的壓力──他要盡力最到最好，確保自己成為良好的模範。</p>

<p>〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕美國太空總署（NASA）在上週完成首批「阿提米絲計畫」（Artemis），13位學員全部順利結訓；其中，曾當過海豹特種部隊隊員，畢業於哈佛醫學院的金強尼（Jonny Kim，音譯），正式成為NASA首位韓裔太空人。</p>
<p>請繼續往下閱讀&hellip;</p>
<p>綜合媒體報導，NASA「阿提米絲計畫」上週正式結訓，13位太空人全都通過考驗，未來將有機會前往火星或月球，進行外星的探測任務。在洛杉磯出身的金強尼現年35歲，高中畢業後隨即進入海豹特種部隊（Navy SEAL），被派駐到中東參加過上百次戰役；在退伍之後，金強尼還從哈佛醫學院畢業，並在麻州總醫院（MGH）擔任住院醫師。</p>
<p>根據外電報導，金強尼於2017年通過全球1萬8000人的海選，上週通過NASA培訓，成為第一位韓國裔太空人，他14日在推特上表示，「非常榮幸與太空總署的兄弟姊妹站在一起，我們很幸運能夠脫穎而出，成為代表全體人類的太空人，讓我們為了世界與後代努力打造更好的將來」。</p>
<p>A true privilege and honor to walk among the @NASA Astronaut Corps with my brothers and sisters.

<h3 id="jonny-kim-is-the-seal-mathematician-doctor-astronaut-we-desperately-need-right-now">&ldquo;Jonny Kim Is The SEAL-Mathematician-Doctor-Astronaut We Desperately Need Right Now&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://api.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/23523532dasf.jpg?quality=85" alt="img">
Being selected as an astronaut candidate is an amazing accomplishment in and of itself, but that&rsquo;s just the beginning of a lengthy and challenging process. After accession into the program, candidates are evaluated at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for about two years. During that time, they complete International Space Station systems training, extravehicular activity skills training, robotics skills training, Russian language training, and aircraft flight readiness training. If successful, they are then officially designated as astronauts and are eligible to be selected for a specific space mission. Once assigned to a specific mission, astronauts complete advanced training unique to that mission.</p>
<p>This process of baseline training followed by advanced training is not unlike his first career as a SEAL, or even his second career as an M.D. Every SEAL completes Basic Underwater Demolition School (BUDS) in Coronado, California. This provides a baseline of common skills, techniques, and terminology. From there, however, SEALS are assigned to specific SEAL teams that may have different specialties, and each SEAL team tailors its training to its upcoming deployments. In a similar manner, every M.D. completes essentially the same curriculum in medical school, then goes on to advanced training, depending on what the assigned specialty is. It works roughly the same way with astronauts. Once they complete the baseline training as astronauts, they proceed to advanced training unique to their specialty or mission.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s next for Jonny? At this point, he&rsquo;s certainly interested in the progress of NASA&rsquo;s plan to restore a domestic manned spaceflight capability. With the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA lost its &ldquo;in house&rdquo; capability to send U.S. astronauts into space on its own equipment. As a temporary solution that is now nearing a decade in use, NASA contracted with the Russian space agency Roscosmos to provide launch services for U.S. astronauts to get to the International Space Station (ISS). A recent spate of failures on the Russian Soyuz family of rockets have put the ISS at risk of having to operate in unmanned mode with no astronauts on board.</p>
<p>Needless to say, NASA is very interested in avoiding that unpleasant scenario and is actively working on the Commercial Crew Development Program to restore America&rsquo;s ability to launch astronauts into outer space onboard domestically manufactured space vehicles. The two competing models in the NASA program are the SpaceX Crew Dragon space capsule, and the Boeing CST-100 Starliner crew capsule. Both of these space vehicles have gone through extensive research, development, and testing, and are nearing certification to carry humans. The initial focus of this program is to get U.S. astronauts to the ISS. If both space vehicles prove capable, the mission sets will probably expand beyond the ISS to other manned space flight missions.</p>
<p>As far as Jonny&rsquo;s initial service assignment as an astronaut, like all members of his astronaut class, he entered training as part of the Artemis program, through which NASA is actively pursuing a return to the Moon. Manned missions in the Artemis program will use the Orion space capsule. In contrast to the Crew Dragon and CST-100 Starliner craft, which are strictly transfer vehicles intended to get astronauts from earth to the ISS, Orion is optimized to support astronauts for long-duration missions that go beyond low earth orbit. As of now, Orion can support missions of up to 21 days duration, more than enough to get from Earth to the Moon and back. Eventually, NASA hopes to build on the success of a return to the Moon with a mission to Mars.</p>
<p>While his life so far has been nothing short of amazing, what many people notice about Jonny Kim is that he is an extremely humble man who describes himself as a servant of a greater cause, who never forgets where he came from. Of his decision to join the Navy and become a SEAL, in an interview with the Annals of Emergency Medicine, he said &ldquo;Going into the Navy was the best decision I ever made in my life because it completely transformed that scared boy who didn&rsquo;t have any dreams to someone who started to believe in himself.&rdquo; Even though he is now in what is widely considered the most elite group of people on the planet, astronauts, he still maintains an air of humility and a focus on service.</p>
<p>At this point, while SEAL/mathematician/M.D./astronaut Jonathan Kim is on track to be assigned to a long-duration space flight that goes beyond low earth orbit as part of the Artemis program, he does not yet have an assigned mission. That means he might be assigned to a manned mission to the moon or a developmental mission that goes beyond low earth orbit, but not all the way to the moon, or a mission to the ISS in low earth orbit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be sure to follow his progress and give you an update when he gets assigned to his first mission. But above all else, this guy&rsquo;s insane resume and accomplishments at such a young age really highlight what is possible if you give it your all, regardless of your ethnicity or background. And he hasn&rsquo;t even flown into space yet!</p>
<p>We need real role models and heroes these days, not just movie stars or pro athletes. By all accounts, Jonny Kim fits the bill.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.cache.storm.mg/styles/smg-800x533-fp/s3/media/image/2019/05/31/20190531-070814_U15150_M524640_e336.jpg?itok=feMpbyWa" alt="img">
美國航空暨太空總署應川普要求，啟動 「2024重返月球計劃」。在NASA2019年5月公布的12名太空人名單中，亞洲面孔的金喬尼特別讓人印象深刻。現年36歲的金喬尼，高中畢業後進入海軍服役，並成為特種部隊「海豹部隊」的一員。退伍後，金喬尼快速地用3年完成聖地牙哥大學的數學學士學位，隨即於2009年考取哈佛醫學院。2017年6月從1萬8000人脫穎而出，入選為登月計畫太空人時，金喬尼已經是麻省總醫院的第3年住院醫生。</p>
<p>軍人、醫生、太空人</p>
<p>脫下醫師袍，穿上太空衣，這並不是金喬尼（Jonny Kim）第1次轉換跑道，從原本高強度的職業，邁向更困難的挑戰。在考取哈佛醫學院（HMS)、成為麻省總醫院（MGH）的住院醫生之前，金喬尼曾是擁有百餘次作戰經驗、獲得銅星（Bronze Star）和銀星（Silver Star）勳章肯定的海豹部隊（Navy SEAL）戰士。</p>
<p>為脫離舒適圈而從軍 人生最佳的抉擇</p>
<p>金喬尼1983年誕生於加州洛杉磯（Los Angeles），父母從南韓移民美國。家庭的不穩定，和學校生活的不順遂，讓金喬尼無法從自己身上感受到他非常欽佩的特質：太空人的勇氣，以及特種部隊的沉穩專業、挑戰逆境的決心。高中畢業後，他選擇加入海軍，而且是海軍的菁英：海豹部隊。「我並不喜歡當時的自己，我必須重新找到自我，還有身份認同。對我來說，脫離舒適圈、離開成長歷程中熟悉的人尋找冒險，這是我的漫長奮鬥（odyssey），也是我人生中做過的最佳抉擇」金喬尼2017年向《哈佛校報》（The Harvard Gazette）表示。</p>
<p>@joerogan You should get navy seal, doctor and nasa pilot Jonny Kim on your podcast. #joeroganexperience pic.twitter.com/UHgifkONs7 — mathias idsøe (@wintrade2) 2019年5月28日</p>
<p>曾一度想放棄 失去摯友後更努力向前</p>
<p>而海豹部隊的訓練，就如同官方宣傳的一樣艱困，金喬尼說，他曾一度想在 「魔鬼訓練周」（Hell Week）的時候放棄：「5天之中只能睡2次覺，每次2小時，他們會給你非常溫暖、舒服的睡袋，但時間一到就把你叫醒，隨即在寒冷的海水中進行訓練，當時我感受到的是加倍的寒冷，因為身體非常脆弱，體能訓練的時候你至少還有疼痛可以克服，身體冷的時候，你只有自己。」</p>
<p>通過額外的訓練後，金喬尼投身實戰，並立即察覺到，實戰和自己的想像差距甚大。金喬尼告訴《哈佛公報》（Harvard Gazette）的記者，他仍認為摯友戰死沙場，自己必須負責：「直到今日，每天，我都會想起那些無法回到家鄉的人們，失去戰友的現實，不斷刺激著我讓生活過得更有價值，我也嘗試去彌補逝者們，可能為這個社會帶來的正面影響。」</p>
<p>「投槍從醫」無法救治戰友的無力感是轉捩點</p>
<p>2009年，當金喬尼有機會成為軍官時，他毅然放棄軍旅身涯，投身聖地牙哥大學（University of San Diego）數學系，一心只想著趕快畢業後、報考哈佛醫學院。金喬尼說，2006年在伊拉克戰場，作為軍醫的他，無法救回摯友們的無力感，在他的生命中留下不可抹滅的傷痕：「他的臉傷得很重，我能做的事情不多，只能盡力保持他呼吸道暢通、維持正確的姿勢，他需要外科醫生，即使我最後幫他找到醫生，但仍回天乏術。」</p>
<p>毫無適應不良 教授盛讚最踏實的人</p>
<p>3年全勤、連暑期課程都不放過的金喬尼，很快地就從聖地牙哥大學畢業，隨即考取哈佛醫學院。醫學院負責輔導退伍軍人學生的神經生理學助理教授卡多佐（David Cardozo），盛讚金喬尼是「想像中最踏實的人，非常有天賦、而且擁有無與倫比的人格，他在這裡表現得非常好」。 在醫學院的第3年，金喬尼獲得麻省總醫院急診部主任布朗（David Brown）的指導，並決心投入急診，加入麻省總醫院和布萊根婦女醫院（BWH）合開的急診住院醫生計畫。</p>

<p>挑戰自我 全心投入太空任務新挑戰</p>
<p>2017年，金喬尼再度挑戰自我，獲選為美國2024年登月計畫「阿提米絲」（Artemis）的太空人。金喬尼說接到錄取電話時，他和妻子正在超市購物，兩個人開心的在超市裡又笑又跳，像是瘋了一樣。他的導師布朗也為他感到高興：「NASA怎麼可能不要他？我們要他、哈佛醫學院也要他，所有人都想擁有金喬尼！」對於這個得來不易的機會，金喬尼一如往常，謙虛以對，並帶著一絲幽默：「我又要再次成為學生，在另一個圖騰柱（totem pole）的底端認真學習，全力吸收知識。我很期待接下來的冒險，我想這會是另一番事業，我只能說：『這太令人不敢置信了，竟然有人付錢讓我做這個工作！』」

<h3 id="jonny-kim--a-35-year-old-nasa-astronaut-doctor-navy-seal-and-combat-veteran--reveals-what-he-learned-from-his-greatest-mistake">&ldquo;Jonny Kim — a 35-year-old NASA astronaut, doctor, Navy SEAL, and combat veteran — reveals what he learned from his greatest mistake&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e690eb084159f57af0820b9?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Jonny Kim, age 35, graduated in January as a full member of the NASA astronaut corps. He may one day join a mission to the moon or Mars.</p>
<p>Before he was an astronaut, though, Kim served as a Navy SEAL who went on 100 combat missions, racked up service medals, earned a math degree, became a medical doctor, and more.</p>
<p>Kim told Business Insider one of the most important lessons he was ever taught came from one of his greatest mistakes, which was during the Iraq War and involved a close friend getting shot in the face.</p>
<p>Kim said he learned that &ldquo;ego is probably one of the biggest poisons&rdquo; in society and that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s toxic to any environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>The path to success is sometimes riddled with hardship. For combat veterans especially, those moments can be exceedingly cutting and difficult to talk about with those who&rsquo;ve never served.</p>
<p>But brand-new NASA astronaut Jonny Kim, age 35 — who in his previous life earned a math degree, became a medical doctor, and participated in 100 combat missions as a Navy SEAL (and who makes US senators feel &ldquo;horribly, horribly inadequate&rdquo;) — recently opened up in an interview with Business Insider about what he said was perhaps his greatest mistake.</p>
<p>Kim is a first-generation Korean-American and, in the not-too-distant future, be asked by NASA to risk his life rocketing to the moon or Mars.</p>
<p>If he makes either or perhaps even both trips, he will take with him that and other lessons of his past.</p>
<p>Kim says his &lsquo;greatest mistake&rsquo; came after a friend in the service was shot in the face</p>
<p>Kim says it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;to learn a lot every time you fail&rdquo; — a tough dynamic to embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could talk to my younger self, I would just say that the path to great things is filled with a lot of stumbles, suffering, and challenges along the way,&rdquo; he told Business Insider. &ldquo;But if you have the right attitude and know that hard times will pass — and you get up each time — you will reach your destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim says his greatest mistake happened during the Iraq War in 2006. Leading up to that moment was a preceding one, during which was serving as a combat medic who was &ldquo;seriously outranked&rdquo; by a physician&rsquo;s assistant (PA) following a mortar attack. After Kim struggled to insert an intravenous needle to stabilize a wounded soldier, he said, the PA was &ldquo;giving him a hard time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was professionally embarrassed. It affected me and I wanted to do better, but I was also intimidated by this guy because he was older than me, he outranked me, and had a lot more experience,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;He kind of was making me feel small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not too long after that, he said, his friend and sniper Ryan Job was shot in the face in the line of duty. (Job survived the attack yet died several years later during facial reconstruction surgery.) Kim said he managed to stabilize Job, but disagreed with the PA about what to do next; Kim wanted to get him to an operating room right away, while the PA wanted to insert a breathing tube up his nose — what he said is a very painful procedure — during a stopover en route to a hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something you would never do for someone with suspected maxillary fractures, facial fractures, which Ryan definitely did have from being shot in the face,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;I remember getting in a really heated argument, trying to do my best to stand up for my friend, because I know that this procedure that this physician&rsquo;s assistant wanted to do would severely hurt if not kill my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that point, Kim said &ldquo;nearby Army soldiers&rdquo; asked him to &ldquo;clear and safe&rdquo; his weapons outside, per a strict Army regulation, at which time he reluctantly left Job&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>When he returned, the PA had inserted the device into his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that that is one of the biggest failures I&rsquo;ve ever had: It was protecting my friend. I knew what the right thing was. I don&rsquo;t think I fought hard enough to protect him,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;I knew what the right thing was to do and I was intimidated by this senior figure, but it wasn&rsquo;t a good excuse for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim knows he stood up for his friend, and hard, but says he wonders today &ldquo;if there was something more he could have done&rdquo; in terms of taking a more extreme measure, like &ldquo;refusing to go outside to clear his weapon or threatening to report the PA to his superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lesson he learned, he said: &ldquo;Ego is probably one of the biggest poisons we can have — it&rsquo;s toxic to any environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>US Navy Lt. Jonny Kim, a Navy SEAL and Harvard-trained physician who recently graduated from NASA training, stressed that the skills he obtained throughout his military career complemented the ones he gained from his medical experience.</p>
<p>In an interview with Business Insider, Kim outlined the &ldquo;hard skills&rdquo; he learned from being a SEAL — from deploying twice to Iraq, to participating in dozens of combat missions and earning a Silver Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEALs were very good in teaching me hard skills — that means resilience, pushing past your mental and physical boundaries; and having an enormously high threshold for pain,&rdquo; Kim said.</p>
<p>Kim contrasted the hard skills with &ldquo;soft skill&rdquo; traits that he picked up during his education from Harvard Medical School and his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of these things that are very useful, but some &hellip; I had to learn outside of the SEALs,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;And that meant adapting to people in your civic group, communicating with people from all walks of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t work with two-year-old toddlers who are in the emergency room, or 85-year-olds who are on their deathbed and want someone to talk to and hold their hand with,&rdquo; Kim said, referring to his military experience. &ldquo;A lot of those soft skills — working with groups of people who I&rsquo;ve never met before to accomplish a mission, adapting to personality types — those are skills I&rsquo;ve learned outside the SEAL time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim said it was a mixture of the soft and hard skills he learned that enabled him to become one of the 13 astronaut candidates to graduate from NASA&rsquo;s latest program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say that the combination of those two skills, soft and hard skills, really enabled me to be a good candidate as an astronaut,&rdquo; Kim said.</p>
<p>But possessing the two traits is only half the battle, Kim said — it&rsquo;s also important to know when to apply each skill set. Despite some of the stereotypes of being a Navy SEAL, Kim said nearly all of the SEALs he served with were masters of controlling their emotions, a skill that helped him transition from being a SEAL to a physician and astronaut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that SEALs [have] this connotation of being very aggressive and hardcore,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;And in a lot of ways, that&rsquo;s correct, but I&rsquo;d like to make this point clear: 99% of Navy SEALs are the most quiet, humble, professional warriors that exercise very controlled aggression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Controlled aggression, to me, is one of the most important traits to have,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;To have that social intelligence to know when to exert aggression in the military environment, and when to stay calm, cool, and collected.&rdquo;
