Bhubaneswar: Veteran Ollywood actor Bijay Mohanty, who is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Hyderabad, will return to Odisha on Sunday.</p>
<p>A special ambulance van has left for Hyderabad to bring the actor back home. After his return, he will be admitted to a private hospital in Bhubaneswar.</p>
<p>As it was difficult to bring back Mohanty from Hyderabad due to the lockdown, his family had requested Bhubaneswar MP Aparajita Sarangi and actor-turned-BJP youth leader Akhila Kumar Patnaik to facilitate his return.</p>
<p>Following their intervention, a meeting was held between the doctors of the two private hospitals on Friday evening.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBijay Mohanty is a pride of Odisha. We have seen his acting prowess in several movies. Now that he is indisposed, he is willing to return to his home state. In such circumstances, it is our responsibility to stand by him,‚Äù Aparajita told the media here.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBijay Sir is my guru. He taught me acting skills when I was a student at Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya. He used to ask me whether I should always remain with him. I am not working for him as a worker of a political party, but rather as a son working for his father,‚Äù said Akhila Patnaik.</p>
<p>Mohanty, who was staying with his daughter in Hyderabad for the past few years, had undergone a minor surgery after being afflicted with diabetes about 3-4 months ago. Though he recovered later, he complained of acute chest pain on May 25 and was admitted to the ICU of a private hospital in Hyderabad. During the test, he was diagnosed with a critical cardiac problem. However, his health has improved since then, said his wife Tandra Ray.</p>
