Some hospitals have a dedicated rotating bed for this; at mine, our nurses gently roll the patient over. This works by changing how blood flows through the lungs, so it doesn’t pool with gravity in the collapsed bottom of the lungs. Though it might sound odd, researchers have studied prone positioning and found that it reduces mortality in severe lung failure.</p>
<p>And if that isn’t enough?</p>
<p>Your doctors might talk about something called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO. This is essentially a lung bypass machine.</p>
<p>I mention ECMO with caution. While we are newly facing the reality that ventilators are a limited resource, ECMO is far scarcer — some hospitals don’t have any machines at all, while others have a handful at most. And even if there were unlimited machines, ECMO is far from a panacea. It comes with significant risk, including stroke and catastrophic bleeding; however, in very specific cases, it might be the best way to support someone while their lungs heal. If your doctors think ECMO is the next best move, they will talk with the patient’s family members about the risks and benefits before they would go forward.</p>
<p>What else are doctors monitoring in the I.C.U.?</p>
<p>We monitor the function of every organ at least once a day, and often more frequently than that. Our goal is to make sure that to whatever extent possible, we keep the rest of the organs healthy while the lungs recover — with a particularly careful eye to the heart and kidneys. We also monitor for signs of a new infection and, if we suspect one, we treat quickly and aggressively with antibiotics.</p>
<p>Will there be long-term lung damage?</p>
<p>Covid-19 is new. We don’t yet have long-term studies of survivors; however, based on the experience of other survivors with ARDS, we do know that recovery is possible, but it will take a long time, as long as months to years. We also understand that ARDS survivors can face a constellation of issues — anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, even cognitive dysfunction — after they recover from their critical illness. As we see more survivors of ARDS from Covid-19, these are questions and issues that we as doctors will need to address.</p>
<p>What if doctors can’t get a patient off the vent?</p>
<p>Sometimes, when improvement is slow and someone has been on the ventilator for two weeks or so, we talk to family members about a procedure called a tracheostomy tube, a plastic tube in the neck that offers a more permanent connection to the ventilator. The breathing tube itself can do damage to the vocal cords if left in for more than about two weeks, so the tracheostomy, or “trach,” allows more time for the lungs to recover, while avoiding damage to the vocal cords. Often this period of recovery also requires a transfer to a facility called a long-term acute care hospital.</p>
<p>For some patients, particularly those who were healthy before, this makes sense. For others, who might be older or more infirm with other health problems, a trach might not be within their goals of care.

A shortage of ventilators will put lives at risk, so health authorities around the world are doing everything they can to get more</p>
<p>How ventilators work and why they are so important in saving people with coronavirus</p>
<p>Health authorities around the world are trying to find ways to fill their hospitals with more ventilators to cope with increasing numbers of coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>Car manufacturers are offering to help build more of the machines. In New York, city mayor Bill de Blasio says he needs 15,000.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of people who catch the Covid-19 disease experience only mild symptoms, about 6% need hospital care, with older patients at higher risk.</p>
<p>Australian authorities say they are confident they can avoid any shortage of ventilators.</p>
<p>Experts have told Guardian Australia that these efforts will be crucial, because a shortage of ventilators would put lives at risk.</p>

<p>“The reason this is a crisis is because without the ventilators, patients will die,” says Prof David Story, deputy director of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Integrated Critical Care, and a staff anaesthetist at Austin Hospital.</p>
<p>Prof Sarath Ranganathan, a board member of Lung Foundation Australia and director of respiratory and sleep medicine at Melbourne’s The Royal Children’s Hospital, said: “The experience in Italy and Spain, and the modelling used by mathematicians around the world, indicates the number of people who will become critically ill with Covid-19 will greatly exceed the capacity to care for them using respiratory support.</p>
<p>“Without access to ventilators many patients who might survive the infection will die.”</p>
<p>What is a ventilator and how does it work?</p>
<p>A mechanical ventilator is a machine that’s used to support patients with severe respiratory conditions that impact the lungs, including pneumonia.</p>
<p>Before a patient is placed on a ventilator, Day says medical staff – often anaesthetists – will perform a procedure called intubation.</p>
<p>After a patient is sedated and given a muscle relaxant, a tube is placed through the mouth and into the windpipe.</p>
<p>Day says the procedure is routine but, with Covid-19 patients, medical staff need to take extreme precautions to make sure they do not become infected with the virus.</p>
<p>“We have people almost in full hazmat suits,” he says.</p>
<p>The breathing tube is then attached to the ventilator and medical staff can adjust the rate that it pushes the air and oxygen into the lungs, and adjust the oxygen mix.</p>
<p>When would a patient go onto a ventilator?</p>
<p>Before deciding to put a patient onto a ventilator, Story says doctors are looking for signs of “respiratory failure”.</p>
<p>“The breathing rate will increase, they’ll look distressed, the CO2 in the blood goes up and they can become sedated and confused,” he says.</p>
<p>He says while a normal breathing rate is about 15 breaths a minute, if the rate gets to about 28 times a minute, then this is a signal that ventilation may be needed.</p>
<p>Before going on a mechanical ventilator, Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician, says there may be other attempts to increase a patient’s oxygen levels.</p>
<p>These “non-invasive” methods of ventilation can include masks and oxygen tanks.</p>
<p>Story says that with Covid-19, medical staff were looking to avoid non-invasive methods because patients would still cough and splutter, increasing the risk of the virus being transferred to medical staff.</p>
<p>How soon might a patient need a ventilator and for how long?</p>
<p>Ranganathan says once a doctor sees that a patient needs a ventilator, “it is required quickly”.</p>
<p>He says: “The patient can be sustained for short periods of time using manual forms of ventilation such as using a bag and mask system with oxygen, but usually being attached to a ventilator needs to happen within 30 minutes if critical.”</p>
<p>Story says that in severe Covid-19 patients, a life-threatening condition can develop called acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards) that requires ventilators to deliver smaller volumes of oxygen and air, but at higher rates.</p>
<p>This could mean a patient may need to be on a ventilator “for weeks”.</p>
<p>To avoid complications from the breathing tube going down the throat, Story says a tracheostomy is carried out so the tube can go straight into the windpipe through the neck.</p>
<p>“Patients can be more awake with tracheostomy and the hole just heals itself,” says Story.</p>
<p>“If patients develop Ards they will be in an intensive care unit for weeks and they’ll die without ventilators.”</p>
<p>Why a shortage of ventilators matters, and what’s being done to avoid it.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious ways to avoid a shortage of ventilators, is to reduce the numbers of people catching the disease in the first place. That means following all the health advice, including social distancing and hygiene rules.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society and the industry minister, Karen Andrews, have all expressed confidence that a shortage can be avoided.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s coronavirus self-isolation rules: who has to do it and how it works Read more</p>
<p>The Australian government is also investigating whether ventilators used on animals in veterinary clinics could be converted. Sleep apnoea machines and anaesthetic machines are also options.</p>
<p>Story says ventilators used in ambulances could be used as back up.</p>
<p>All of that work will be crucial in saving lives if the social distancing measures and community lockdowns don’t stem the flow of patients into critical care.</p>
<p>Wilson said: “Health care workers responsible for managing severe life-threatening cases like Covid-19 are extremely concerned regarding their ability to use appropriate support for large numbers of patients expected to suffer respiratory failure.</p>
<p>“In essence, this means that many will not be able to be treated with mechanical ventilation and difficult decisions will have to be made by staff, families and patients about the limits of support. There are many ethical dilemmas in this, and none can be easily resolved.”

<h3 id="sharing-a-single-ventilator-between-4-patients-is-possible-but-it-could-be-disastrous">Sharing a single ventilator between 4 patients is possible. But it could be disastrous.</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/io8fsBaDAnFmsChRDS2Cma-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
Editor&rsquo;s note: This story was updated on at 2:55 pm E.D.T to include a joint statement from a number of societies, including the American Society of Anesthesiologists. It was updated at 5:15 pm E.D.T to note that a hospital in New York City is practicing ventilator sharing.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t enough ventilators in the United States to keep alive the hundreds of thousands of people who will need them during the COVID-19 pandemic . There may be a stopgap, however.</p>
<p>Doctors can reconfigure existing ventilators so that these lifesaving devices serve either two or four patients simultaneously, rather than just one at a time, according to a 2006 feasibility study in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine .</p>
<p>The study was written in the aftermath of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina , but in light of the new coronavirus outbreak, one of the study&rsquo;s authors published a YouTube tutorial to show how this idea could work for patients whose breathing is impaired by the new coronavirus .</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that study, we just looked at simple equipment available in the emergency department and a way to modify the ventilator to ventilate four patients,&rdquo; study co-author Dr. Charlene Irvin Babcock, an emergency medicine physician at St. John Hospital and Medical Center in Detroit, said in the video.</p>
<p>Related: Coronavirus in the US: Latest COVID-19 news and case counts</p>
<p>A ventilator is a machine that can help a person breathe by delivering oxygen through a tube placed in the mouth or nose, or through a hole in the front of the neck, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>In essence, the study shows that a ventilator can be modified with adapters and T-shaped tubes so that it has four ports for four patients, said Babcock, who co-wrote the study with Dr. Greg Neyman. At the time, Neyman was a resident in emergency medicine at St. John Hospital and Medical Center, and now works as an emergency physician at several hospitals in Hamilton, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Their experiment simulated four adults weighing 154 lbs. (70 kilograms) getting ventilation for 12 hours. However, Babcock cautioned that transforming a ventilator this way is &ldquo;off label,&rdquo; meaning that it&rsquo;s not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Moreover, it was never studied in people; the 2006 study merely used lung simulators, rather than human subjects.</p>
<p>But this idea was put to use by Dr. Kevin Menes, an emergency room physician who treated mass shooting victims at the 2017 Las Vegas country music concert. Menes had been a resident with Neyman, so he was aware of the ventilator study. (You can read about Menes&rsquo; harrowing night at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas here.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can imagine that with a lot of penetrating torso and CNS [central nervous system] injuries, [Menes] intubated a lot of patients,&rdquo; Babcock said. &ldquo;They received a large volume of patients very quickly and they ran out of ventilators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Menses directed that each ventilator get reconfigured with one T-tube so it could serve two patients. &ldquo;It was very successful,&rdquo; Babcock said. &ldquo;He was able to keep them alive for hours as they waited for outside ventilator supports to come in and help them supply the patient need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This past week, with the COVID-19 crisis, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan began practicing ventilator sharing, according to The New York Times. For now, the hospital is putting a maximum of two people on a single ventilator. But some people are still getting their own if they have a complex case, Dr. Jeremy Beitler, a pulmonary disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, told The New York Times.</p>
<p>However, in a statement released today (March 26), medical societies across the country came out strongly against this idea. &ldquo;Sharing mechanical ventilators should not be attempted because it cannot be done safely with current equipment,&rdquo; the societies said in the statement . &ldquo;The physiology of patients with COVID‐19‐onset acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is complex.&rdquo; Even in ideal circumstances, 40% to 60% of ventilated patients with ARDS and lung disease die, they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better to purpose the ventilator to the patient most likely to benefit than fail to prevent, or even cause, the demise of multiple patients,&rdquo; they said. The statement is supported by the following: the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (ASPF), American Association of Critical‐Care Nurses (AACN) and American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST).</p>
<p>Even Babcock said that using a ventilator for multiple people isn&rsquo;t going to be easy. Doctors would have to pair together patients with similar lung sizes. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to put a pediatric patient with an adult patient, because that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; Babcock said. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be able to ensure that the same volume [of oxygen] is delivered everywhere appropriately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, patients need to be breathing with the same resistance to the ventilator&rsquo;s oxygen flow. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to put a patient with severe bronchospasm with a patient who did not have bronchospasm,&rdquo; a condition in which the muscles tighten in the lungs, which can make breathing difficult, Babcock said. That&rsquo;s because people breathing with different resistances &ldquo;might change the amount of volumes, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sure that there were equal volumes delivered to everybody,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Using the same ventilator for multiple people could spread germs, but in this case, these patients would have COVID-19 already anyway, Babcock noted. In addition, the patients would need to be sedated for this to work, Babcock added in the YouTube comments.</p>
<p>But this setup is designed to be a temporary one, used only when there is a &ldquo;disaster surge involving multiple casualties with respiratory failure,&rdquo; the researchers wrote in the study. COVID-19 patients typically need artificial ventilation for longer than 12 hours, the amount of time analyzed in the study. And if one patient improves and needs less oxygen, while another worsens and needs more, a ventilator hooked up to two people could not adjust to both of them, as ProPublica reported. Getting too little or too much oxygen can damage the lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never heard of ventilators being shared between multiple patients as the process of ventilation is very personal — the controls and sensors are set to satisfy an individual patient[&lsquo;s] needs and wellbeing,&rdquo; Mark Tooley, a fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering in the United Kingdom, told MailOnline in response to the video and study. &ldquo;&lsquo;The risk of infection would also be high if used for seriously ill patients. In theory it could be possible, but it would be a very complex procedure, fraught with issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, states are frantically trying to acquire ventilators. For instance, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York has procured about 7,000 ventilators, but needs at least 30,000 more, according to ABC News. Some companies are also switching gears to make them, including SpaceX and Tesla, run by Elon Musk, Live Science previously reported.</p>
