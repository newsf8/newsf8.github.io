<h3 id="on-international-olympic-day-2020-remembering-indias-greatest-olympians">&ldquo;On International Olympic Day 2020, remembering India‚Äôs greatest Olympians&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thebridge.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Abhinav-Bindra.jpg" alt="img">
India has showcased some of the best talents in the world when it comes to Olympics. Despite many challenges that athletes and sportspersons face in India, they have always managed to secure medals for the country.</p>
<p>India has nine gold medals, 7 silver medals and 12 bronze medals in the Olympics which tallies to 28 medals. In the spirit of Olympic day, here are three of the top Indian Olympians who have represented and done a lot for the country.</p>
<p>Abhinav Bindra</p>
<p>Though currently a retired shooter and businessman, Abhinav Bindra is a very well known name in Olympic shooting. He was very young when he developed an affinity for shooting and trained hard to make his debut at the Commonwealth Games 1998 at the age of 15. Abhinav has one many medals in various competitions but due to a severe back injury, he had to stop training which would‚Äôve hampered his chances for the 2008 Olympics. However he made a comeback and competed in 2006 in the ISSF World Shooting Championships which qualified him for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing which would become the highlight for the country as he scored India‚Äôs first individual gold medal. He has won a total of 6 gold medals, one in the Olympics, 4 in the Commonwealth Games and another one in the World Championships. He has also won three medals in Asian Games. Abhinav also founded an organization dedicated to helping upcoming athletes train by providing assistance and good facilities.</p>
<p>Sushil Kumar</p>
<p>Being the only Indian athlete to win two medals since Indian independence in a sport other than hockey, Sushil Kumar was inspired by his father and cousin to take up wrestling and has made major strides. He began training under veteran wrestling Coach Yashvir Singh at the age of 14 and made his mark in the World Cadet Games in 1998. Coming from humble beginnings, his family could only provide for one but overcoming these hurdles, Sushil Kumar managed to secure an Olympic bronze medal in wrestling in 2008, an achievement that India has accomplished unstoppably for the past three Olympics. He then won a silver at the 2012 London Olympics. He inspired the likes of Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat who are today representing our country in wrestling. Undeterred by the coronavirus, Sushil continues training and is hoping to secure another medal for the postponed Tokyo Olympics which will be held in 2021. He has opened a wrestling academy in the town of Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh to give back and encourage wrestling as a sport.</p>
<p>Balbir Singh Sr.</p>
<p>The late Balbir Singh Sr. is a hockey legend who is known for setting the unbeatable record of having scored the most number of goals as an individual. Training at a young age under the guidance of hockey player Harbail Singh, Balbir Singh made immense progress and was captain of his team in the All India Inter-University competition where his team prospered and won the titles for three consecutive years, 1943, 1944, and 1945. His debut at the London Olympics in 1948 resulted in India winning 4-0. India made major strides in Helsinki Olympics of 1952 with Singh scoring 9 out of the 13 goals India had made. Melbourne Olympics (1956) marked India‚Äôs win in the finals against Pakistan with a score of 1-0 which resulted in Balbir Singh‚Äôs individual goal count to 22 in a total of 8 Olympic Games. He was the first sports recipient of the Padma Shri award.</p>

<p>Updated: Jun 17, 2020 18:30 IST</p>
<p>There is no substitute for hard work and discipline if you want to chase your dream of winning an Olympic medal, 2016 Rio Games bronze medallist Sakshi Malik told young wrestlers in an interaction on Wednesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was inspired by Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt as they started winning medals for India at international level. When they made India proud at the Olympics, it served as a huge motivation. I also wanted to win an Olympic medal for my country,‚Äù said Sakshi, who was a guest speaker in Sports Authority of India‚Äôs online training programme - E-Pathshala.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI come from an ordinary background. No one in my family was a wrestler. My grandfather had done some mud wrestling. I was not aware of the Olympics while growing up. If someone like me can achieve success and win an Olympic medal, any young athlete who is willing to work hard can be successful,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Sakshi, the first Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal, shared her inspiring story with the junior and sub-junior wrestlers who are part of the online training course.</p>
<p>She said the desire to travel in a plane and see the world fuelled her dreams.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had been playing sports since I was a child but had little idea about the Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. It was after I got into wrestling and started winning medals at junior level that the interest in these events started going up,‚Äù said the 27-year-old, who has also won two Commonwealth Games and four Asian Championships medals, and a bronze at the 2010 junior world championships. The was awarded the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award following her Olympics bronze.</p>
<p>Recalling her bouts at Rio, Sakshi said she was determined to somehow win bronze after reaching the medal playoff. She defeated Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs Aisuluu Tynybekova in a dramatic contest in 58kg repechage, overturning a 0-5 deficit to snatch victory (8-5) with seconds left in the clock.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I reached that bronze medal match, I didn‚Äôt want to lose at the final hurdle. My coach kept telling me ‚Äòyou are better than her‚Äô. It was a tough match and only at the very end was I able to win. I can‚Äôt explain in words what the feeling was, I didn‚Äôt know whether to laugh, smile or cry,‚Äù said Sakshi, recalling the moments when coach Kuldeep Malik carried her around the arena on his shoulders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt took me some time to realise what I had achieved. My coach explained to me that my life will change after the medal. When I grow old, it is a precious memory that will always remain with me. I am very grateful for all the love the country has given me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sakshi told the youngsters remain positive and stick to their fitness work outs. ‚ÄúThis is a very good initiative by SAI and Wrestling federation. In these difficult times when even we can‚Äôt train properly, with these sessions you can stay at home and learn a lot.‚Äù

<p>10:55am - Retirement reflections from van der Burgh</p>
<p>Olympic swimming gold medallist Cameron van der Burgh spoke to Ash Tulloch after doing the workout.</p>
<p>He retired a couple of years ago and his wife is due to give birth to their first child in September.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only when you stop and you look back and you think about all the amazing things that sport and the Olympics has given you&hellip; I never used to watch my races or interviews because it felt weird to watch them, but now I&rsquo;m retired it&rsquo;s nice to watch your Olympic races or achievements and it makes you extremely proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amazing thing. One day, I&rsquo;m definitely going to make my kids do sport in whichever form that they want to. I&rsquo;m not going to press them into swimming but just to instill those values in them and hopefully they can grow and appreciate it as much as I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van der Burgh also talked about recovering from COVID-19 in a really interesting interview, and a spectacular introduction from Ash is a bonus in this video.</p>

<p>She spoke at length after the workout about what she has been doing during lockdown and why Russia is so dominant in rhythmic gymnastics.</p>
<p>Mamun worked with Olympic Channel on The Z Team and said it was &ldquo;an extraordinary experience&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to train girls for just one week before they went back to competitions.</p>
<p>As far as returning to sport, she admitted, &ldquo;Rhythmic gymnastics is a young person&rsquo;s sport. It&rsquo;s very hard to get back there after having a baby. My back is not as flexible as it used to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I already reached my dream and that&rsquo;s why I plan to fulfill other dreams now.&rdquo; - Margarita Mamun</p>

<p>India&rsquo;s last of eight Olympic golds in men&rsquo;s hockey came back in 1980 with the nation failing to win a medal since.</p>

<p>The Olympic Day workout is hard for us mere mortals, so it&rsquo;s comforting to see Olympians sweat while doing it.</p>
<p>Anthony Ginting and Jonatan Christie are two of the world&rsquo;s top badminton players but even they struggled with some of the exercises, not least the push-ups and dive bombers.</p>
<p>But most importantly, they had a lot of fun doing it.</p>

<p>2:25am - Ji Soyun bids to fire Korea Republic to first Olympic Games appearance</p>

<p>Their star player is midfielder Ji Soyun who is celebrating her third league title with English club Chelsea after the Women&rsquo;s Super League was halted early due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>She is Korea&rsquo;s top scorer with 61 goals in 125 games and says, &ldquo;COVID-19 did pose difficulties for us this year but the postponement gives us more time to prepare. We will work hard and get ourselves ready for the play-off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s our third workout of Olympic Day with Melissa Wu managing to stay really cool and composed and our Paul Sanders getting pretty hot and sweaty.</p>
<p>Wu in Sydney admitted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually glad it&rsquo;s winter here because if it was summer I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;d be the complete opposite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silver medallist in the synchro platform event at Beijing 2008 aged just 16, Wu hopes to compete in her fourth Games at Tokyo 2020 and says the year postponement might be &ldquo;a blessing in disguise&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been good to have another year up my sleeve because I was a little bit injured this year. That&rsquo;s my goal, working towards that. Having this extra time is really good for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she has an extra incentive with Tokyo being her favourite city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I actually went to Japan for the first time on holiday after Rio. I went to Tokyo and a few other cities and I just fell in love with it. I&rsquo;ve been there a few times since for training camps and competitions and I just love the people, the culture, everything about it. So I reckon an Olympics there would be amazing.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="reading-motivational-books-helped-me-keep-mental-balance-during-lockdown-sreejesh">&ldquo;Reading motivational books helped me keep mental balance during lockdown: Sreejesh&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thebridge.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sindhu-2.png" alt="img">
Back home after nearly three months of confinement because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian hockey team goalkeeper P R Sreejesh says he fought against his mental demons during the lockdown phase by reading a lot of ‚Äúmotivational‚Äù literature.</p>
<p>With his father, who is a cardiac patient, and two kids back home in Kerala, Sreejesh admitted that it was tough to keep away negative thoughts during the lockdown period but he channelised his energy by reading ‚Äì American Olympian triathlete Joanna Zeiger‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Champions Mindset ‚Äì An Athlete‚Äôs Guide to Mental Toughness‚Äô.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was really tough as our lifestyle changed completely. The main thing was to strike a balance in your thoughts. My father is a heart patient and I have two kids ‚Äî daughter who is 6 and a son who is 3. So I was more worried about their health since the two are in high risk age groups,‚Äù Sreejesh told PTI.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn one side I was feeling homesick and on the other I didn‚Äôt want to risk them by going home because there were chances of contracting the virus while travelling. So I got involved into reading for peace. I read a lot during the lockdown, from fiction, non-fiction to motivational books. These helped me to think differently. The Champions Mindset is a book that I read again.‚Äù</p>
<p>The book is written by Zeiger, who was the 2008 Ironman 70.3 world champion and represented the United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics in triathlon. The book talks about mental toughness and comebacks of athletes in professional sports.</p>
<p>The Indian men and women hockey teams were stuck at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) South Centre in Bengaluru since March 25 when the government announced the nationwide lockdown to control the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But on last Friday, the ‚Äúhomesick‚Äù hockey players were allowed to leave the facility after being granted a month‚Äôs break. Though he is back at home, Sreejesh still has some time before he can play with his kids or roam around freely as he is currently serving 14-day home quarantine as per the guidelines of Kerala government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am really happy to be back home but I am still confined in a room in the first floor of my house. My family members are all staying downstairs and I am under home quarantine upstairs,‚Äù said the 32-year-old.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThough I can see my children but I can‚Äôt touch them and it‚Äôs really frustrating.‚Äù India‚Äôs number one goalkeeper said though they were in a safe place at SAI, Bengaluru, they needed a month‚Äôs break as slowly the players were feeling mentally fragile after being away from home for such a long time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe were in the best and safest place. Though we were under lockdown but still we could roam around inside the campus in small groups. But we never had such a lengthy camp and it started to affect the players. Everyone started to miss their families,‚Äù Sreejesh said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt one point we were unable to take that. It was the same routine from morning till night and we started to feel mentally weaker. The break will do a world of good to the players. We will return fresh both mentally and physically. Our minds will be free and eager to work harder.‚Äù</p>
<p>With uncertainty hanging over resumption of hockey, he said as team they are missing competitive action. Sreejesh, who will be featuring in his third Olympics at Tokyo, is desperate to finish his career with an Olympic medal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTokyo can be my last Olympics but I always prefer to keep small targets. Obviously a medal at the Olympics is the ultimate goal,‚Äù said Sreejesh, who played in 2012 London and 2016 Rio Games. It is always better to play one Olympics and return with a medal than play in three and return empty-handed,‚Äù the former skipper signed off.</p>

<h3 id="sushil-kumar-yogeshwar-dutts-olympics-medals-motivated-me-sakshi-malik">&ldquo;Sushil Kumar, Yogeshwar Dutt&rsquo;s Olympics medals motivated me: Sakshi Malik&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2016-08/18/full/1471504774-4642.jpg" alt="img">
Celebrated woman wrestler on Wednesday said and Yogeshwar Dutt&rsquo;s exploits at the Olympics motivated her to go all out for an Olympic medal during 2016 games in Rio.</p>
<p>Sakshi became India&rsquo;s first woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal when she defeated reigning Asian champion Aisuluu Tynybekova of Kyrgyzstan 8-5 in the 58kg category, despite trailing 05 at one stage, in the repechage medal playoff.</p>
<p>And by her own admission, she had very little idea about the importance of the quadrennial sporting events and it only got a fillip after two-time Olympic medallist Sushil and London Games bronze medallist Yogeshwar&rsquo;s exploits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been playing sports since I was a child but had little idea about the Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games,&rdquo; Sakshi said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was after I got into wrestling and started winning medals at a junior level that the interest in these events started going up. Later on, as and started winning medals including at the Olympics, it served as a huge motivation for me,&rdquo; Sakshi said.</p>
<p>Speaking of her Olympic bronze and the iconic moment when her coach Kuldeep Malik took her for a lap of honour around the arena, she said that it took for the achievement to sink in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I reached that bronze medal match, I didn&rsquo;t want to lose at the final hurdle. My coach kept telling me that you are better than her (opponent).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a tough match and only at the very end was I able to win. I can&rsquo;t explain in words what the feeling of winning was, I didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or smile or cry,&rdquo; she said during a wrestling session of E-Pathshala, the athlete and coach education programme of Sports Authority of India conducted in association with the Wrestling Federation of India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My coach explained to me that my life will change after this medal but when I grow old, it is a precious memory that will always remain with me. I am very grateful for all the love the country has given me after I won the Olympic bronze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During her interaction, Sakshi spoke on the importance of these sessions, which was also attended by WFI coach Jagmandar Singh as well as technical officials and referees.</p>
<p>Sakshi praised SAI and WFI for the initiative on conducting the online classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very good initiative by SAI and WFI. In these difficult times, when even we can&rsquo;t train properly, with these sessions you can stay at home and learn a lot.

<h3 id="prakash-padukones-all-england-title-to-pv-sindhus-basel-gold-indian-badmintons-greatest-moments">&ldquo;Prakash Padukone‚Äôs All England title to PV Sindhu‚Äôs Basel gold: Indian badminton‚Äôs greatest moments&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/142505-dslajaxvbi-1591466559.jpg" alt="img">
It is hard to refute the sentiment that India is a cricket-crazy country. History of Indian sport is filled with instances of hockey and football bringing thousands of fans to stadiums but in recent decades, there has been dominance from the one sport that has pervaded the living rooms of crores in the country. Cricket became an obsession, and cricketers worshipped.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, however, Olympic sporting disciplines have found their footing among the sports-loving public since the turn of the century. More access to events, better exposure through media, coverage and path-breaking international achievements have paved the way for that.</p>
<p>In that regard, it‚Äôs hard to look past badminton as the sport that has grown the most in terms of impact on the Indian sports fan. Alongside shooting and wrestling, the shuttlers from India have been the most successful at the international level consistently in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The Field Famous Five Moments that redefined a sport Read the series</p>
<p>There have been plenty of great moments for the sport over the decades, but here‚Äôs a subjective list of the most significant ones:</p>
<p>Prakash Padukone‚Äôs proud moment (All England Open, 1980)</p>
<p>An Indian conquering the world at Wembley Arena in England. It was as good as it got in 1980 when Prakash Padukone defeated two-time defending champion Liem Swie King to win All England title, the game‚Äôs most coveted title back then.</p>
<p>As we wrote on these pages earlier about that iconic match, the summit clash against King was a tactical affair. The Indonesian star had skipped the European tour to focus on his preparations for the All England and just like Padukone had not dropped a game before the final. King relied on his speed and banked on his big smashes to win points while the 24-year-old Indian, famed for his touch-play, delighted the crowd with an exhibition of delicious strokes at the net.</p>
<p>The result: recorded as 15-3, 15-10 scoreline for Padukone; the impact: unprecedented.</p>
<p>Padukone (rightly) regarded it to be the turning point for the sport in the country.</p>
<p>‚Äú&hellip;if you talk of Indian badminton you could say 1980 was the hallmark; it was pre-1980 and post-1980. So that‚Äôs probably how important I think the the 1980 all England was. ‚ÄúBefore 1980, Badminton was being played but it was what I would call a minority sport, a minor sport. There was not much coverage, nobody knew what badminton was. Only the players who played knew, their parents knew, there were not many facilities, not much money, there was not much international exposure, nobody knew who the players were. But post 1980 all that changed, whatever was not there, that changed. It became a major sport.‚Äù ‚Äî Interview with Scroll.in</p>
<p>All England organisers recently released footage of the 1980 final and it is well worth your time, to have a glimpse at moments that changed Indian badminton forever:</p>
<p>Play</p>
<p>Glory for Gopichand (All England Open, 2001)</p>
<p>Saina Nehwal was trailing in the final of Indonesia Open 2009; indeed, she looked exhausted against Wang Lin. She needed inspiration. Her mind went back to 2001.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe won the All-England Championship in 2001 and although he was tired, he fought hard and won the match. That‚Äôs what I remembered in the Indonesian Open final. When I lost the first game, I got tired. But he inspired me, I remembered his feat and won the title,‚Äù Nehwal said about her first Superseries triumph.</p>
<p>He was, none other than, Pullela Gopichand. He was, of course, Nehwal‚Äôs coach when she won the title in Jakarta (more on that shortly). He was the man who put Indian badminton on the path to glory (as a player first, as a coach afterwards). He was the All England champion in 2001, a feat that spoke volumes not just about Gopichand‚Äôs talent on the court but also about his will and determination off it.</p>
<p>The final itself was a relatively breezy affair for Gopichand as he beat Chen Hong 15-12, 15-6 (and he did not drop a game in the entire tournament) but the path to get there was anything but.</p>
<p>Read more about the win here: Gopichand‚Äôs All England title, a triumph of self-belief</p>
<p>When Gopichand was a picture of delight, with his hands held up in the air, the commentator summed up the winning moments: ‚ÄúWho would have thought at the start of the week the player ranked No 10 in the world would be the champion. But Gopichand has played with such composure, great skill&hellip;a masterful tactician.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was the win that gave Indian badminton the much-needed belief again.</p>
<p>Play</p>
<p>Saina‚Äôs first Superseries triumph (2009 Indonesia Open)</p>
<p>One could write an entire ‚Äúgreatest moments‚Äù article just with the many firsts of Saina Nehwal‚Äôs career. Of course, the moments that immediately come to mind are her bronze medal at 2012 London and how, in 2015, she became the first Indian woman to reach the world No 1 ranking.</p>
<p>But the moment that showed the world for the first time that Nehwal was not just a talented Indian shuttler but a gritty woman who can outlast her opponents and win titles at the expense of the Chinese: Indonesia Open final, 2009.</p>
<p>Nehwal scripted history on June 21, 2009 when she became the first Indian to win a Super Series tournament with a superb victory over third seed Wang Lin in Jakarta. The then 19-year-old Indian star staged a superb comeback and won a thrilling final that lasted 49 minutes, 12-21, 21-18, 21-9.</p>
<p>Having lost in the previous tournament (Singapore Open Super Series) to the same opponent, sixth seed Nehwal was on the backfoot early on. But she dug deep, to level the match in a tight second game before going all out in the decider. From 7-7 in the all important game, she raced to the finish line winning six straight points from 15-9. And with a body smash that did not return, Nehwal won the title.</p>
<p>Her reactions said it all:</p>
<p>Play</p>
<p>In his column for Outlook India, coach Gopichand picked the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games performances as highlights of Nehwal‚Äôs career. But, even in his words, Indonesia was crucial for what Nehwal was trying to achieve. He wrote that Nehwal‚Äôs wins at Indonesia Open (2009, 2010 and 2012) were ‚Äúvery big and very special‚Äù and added:</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo win consistently when the Chinese were on top of the world was a superb achievement. She showed to people across the world how the Chinese wall could be broken. It was, in fact, Saina versus China. The moment Saina could break in, other countries, whether it was Japan or Thailand or Spain or Denmark, many of them started to find ways to breach the Chinese bastion.‚Äù ‚Äî Gopichand via Outlook India</p>
<p>As Nehwal said in 2009, ‚ÄúThey (shuttlers from China) are like machines. That‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôve made myself like a machine. I want to better the Chinese.‚Äù</p>
<p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that Indonesia Open final in 2009 played a huge rule in how Nehwal‚Äôs career shaped up to be one filled with milestones.</p>
<p>Silver for Sindhu (2016 Rio Olympics)</p>
<p>PV Sindhu had already build up a reputation. Two bronze medals at the World Championships in 2013 and 2014 meant she was a force to reckon with at the biggest stage. But at Rio 2016, Nehwal was still the big Olympic medal hope. However, injury ended her dream of bettering the bronze from 2012.</p>
<p>Now, all eyes were on Sindhu as she entered the knockouts.</p>
<p>The ninth seed had to beat Tai Tzu Ying (eighth seed) in the opening round (straight games), then second seed Wang Yihan (straight games) and then sixth seed Nozomi Okuhara (straight games). The world got to witness Sindhu‚Äôs big-game mentality at the biggest stage as she overcame higher-ranked players in each of the knockout rounds to reach the final.</p>
<p>Carolina Marin, the hot favourite coming into the tournament, proved to be one hurdle too tough for the Indian. But by the time she went across the net after the final moments to put a shoulder around a tearful Marin, she had not just won the Olympics silver medal (the first Indian woman to do so): she had won millions of hearts.</p>
<p>Also read: From Huelva to Rio de Janeiro ‚Äì Marin ends Asia‚Äôs badminton dominance</p>
<p>Sensational Sindhu (2019 World Championships)</p>
<p>Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.</p>
<p>Sindhu‚Äôs silver in Rio had set the bar high. And the expectations were that she will bring home titles for fun. Sport, however, doesn‚Äôt work that way. The opponents exist for a reason and for Sindhu, the challenges got harder. First, there was the epic 2017 World Championship final against Okuhara that no one who saw it can ever forget. Then there were silver medals at CWG and Asian Games. Then, there was another silver at Worlds in 2018.</p>
<p>Ridiculously, at times, her caliber was questioned because she was winning ONLY silver medals, that she was only second best at the big events; as if that is some joke. By her own admission recently, it did, however, impact Sindhu. How can it not?</p>
<p>And in Basel, that off-court desperation to win the gold medal was met with the decisiveness on court. She did not just win, she blew her opponents away on her way to the top of the podium.</p>
<p>Also read: Sindhu‚Äôs World C‚Äôships triumph was inevitable, because she willed it to be</p>
<p>Rio Olympics silver medallist was now World Champion PV Sindhu, the first Indian ever to achieve that distinction in the sport. In this writer‚Äôs book, that has to be Indian badminton‚Äôs greatest moment till date.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is easy to forget Sindhu achieved all this before she even turned 25.</p>

<p>Honourable mentions</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to leave out Jwala Gutta and Ashwin Ponnappa‚Äôs 2011 World Championship bronze, that ended India‚Äôs 28-year wait for a medal at Worlds. That medal kick-started India‚Äôs ongoing run of returning with a podium finish from the World Championships. Nehwal‚Äôs 2012 Olympic Games bronze was also an iconic moment but, given her pedigree at the time, bronze was perhaps the least she could have achieved. Padukone‚Äôs Worlds medal in 1983 was also important but not quite as iconic as the 1980 win. Srikanth Kidambi‚Äôs record-equalling fourth Superseries title in 2017 (he was only the fourth player after Lin Dan, Lee Chong Wei and Chen Long to win four or more SS-level tournaments in a calendar year) was also a contender to feature in this list.</p>
