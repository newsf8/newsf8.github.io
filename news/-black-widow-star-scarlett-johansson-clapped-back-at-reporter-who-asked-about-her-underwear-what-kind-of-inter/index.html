<p>Marvel star Scarlett Johansson is considered one of today’s hottest stars. With her upcoming solo film Black Widow and several Avengers installments under her belt, the actress can now also add Oscar nominations to her list of credits after being named for her roles in Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit.</p>
<p>Despite her apparent talent, Johansson has been subjected to a myriad of sexist questions during press tours that her male co-stars have never had to endure.</p>
<p>‘Avengers’ star Scarlett Johansson | Toni Anne Barson/WireImage</p>
<p>‘Black Widow’ star publishes op-ed</p>
<p>In 2009, Johansson wrote a piece for the Huffington Post after getting fed up with false stories on her diet and workout regimens.</p>
<p>“Since dedicating myself to getting into ‘superhero shape,’ several articles regarding my weight have been brought to my attention,” the MCU actress shared. “Claims have been made that I’ve been on a strict workout routine regulated by co-stars, whipped into shape by trainers I’ve never met, eating sprouted grains I can’t pronounce and ultimately losing 14 pounds off my 5’3” frame. … I’m a petite person to begin with, so the idea of my losing this amount of weight is utter lunacy.”</p>
<p>The Oscar-nominated actress went on to describe in detail what a weight loss of that amount would entail for her. “If I were to lose 14 pounds, I’d have to part with both arms. And a foot,” she wrote. “I’m frustrated with the irresponsibility of tabloid media who sell the public ideas about what we should look like and how we should get there.”</p>
<p>Johansson’s main goal was to clearly convey to the public that she is not behind these false messages of unattainable body weight.</p>
<p>“I would be absolutely mortified to discover that some 15-year-old girl in Kansas City read one of these ‘articles’ and decided she wasn’t going to eat for a couple of weeks so she too could ‘crash diet’ and look like Scarlett Johansson,” the Avengers actress stated.</p>

<p>An example of questions for Scarlett Johansson</p>
<p>While promoting the 2012 film The Avengers, Johansson joined her co-stars for the standard press tour. A reporter first posed a question to Iron Man star Robert Downey, Jr.</p>
<p>“Firstly to Robert, throughout Iron Man 1 and 2, Tony Stark started off as a very egotistical character but learns how to fight as a team,” the journalist commented, according to WomenandHollywood.com. “So how did you approach this role, bearing in mind that kind of maturity as a human being when it comes to the Tony Stark character, and did you learn anything throughout the three movies that you made?”</p>
<p>One would think the news woman would direct a similarly introspective question to Johansson, yet she went a completely different route. “And to Scarlett, to get into shape for Black Widow did you have anything special to do in terms of the diet, like did you have to eat any specific food, or that sort of thing?” she asked.</p>
<p>Johansson was clearly put off by the question, where Downey tried to make a joke to break the tension. The actress made a point of letting her frustration be known.</p>
<p>“How come you get the really interesting existential question, and I get the like, ‘rabbit food’ question?” Johansson responded, referencing the inquiry to Downey.</p>

<p>MCU actress gets asked about her underwear … it’s true</p>
<p>The Lost in Translation star ran into yet another inappropriate question when promoting the 2012 film. In an interview with co-star Jeremy Renner, she was asked about what she wears under her Black Widow costume.</p>
<p>“Now were you able to wear undergarments,” the Extra interviewer began, where Johansson cut him off. “You’re like the fifth person that’s asked me that. What is going on?” she replied in frustration. “Since when did people start asking each other about in interviews about their underwear?”</p>
<p>Trying to explain his tasteless question, the reporter continued. “Well it’s because it’s such a skin tight…,” where the actress again interjected. “I’ll leave it up to your imagination,” Johansson said sarcastically. “Whatever you feel like I should be wearing or not wearing under that costume.”</p>
<p>With the interview getting increasingly awkward, the Extra correspondent tried to backtrack asking, “Is it inappropriate?”</p>
<p>Johansson couldn’t hide her incredulousness. “To ask somebody what kind of underpants they’re wearing?” she replied. “What kind of interview is this?” The reporter then tried to use semantics to get out of the uncomfortable direction the interview was taking, but the Marvel actress was clearly not happy.</p>
<p>While this interview is from several years ago, Johansson was on the right track with standing up to such blatant gender bias and she continues to do so today.

<h3 id="black-widow-actress-may-return-for-shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings">&ldquo;Black Widow Actress May Return For Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/158515416174369896-64.jpg" alt="img">
Every now and then a member of a movie’s production team might go on to play a bigger role in the future or even switch jobs entirely. Just like Sam Hargrave, who went from MCU stunt coordinator to feature film director with his extremely well-received Netflix release, Extraction.</p>
<p>Also from the MCU though is Jade Xu, a World Wushu Champion and martial arts actor who’ll play a Red Room assassin in Black Widow. Xu will be one of the Widows facing off against Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff in the upcoming release, which has been pushed to November. But that might not be Xu’s only appearance in a Marvel project. According to CBM, she’s also listed as being part of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and there was reportedly evidence that she was in Australia for its production.</p>
<p>That being said, it should be noted that it’s equally likely she’s a stunt double for Awkwafina’s character, Fah Lo Suee. They’re similar in height and build, after all, which lends far more credence to this theory.</p>

<p>MORE FROM THE WEB Click to zoom</p>
<p>There is one factor that might still support the argument of Xu reprising her role as an elite assassin, though. The article points to the rumored plot, which claims that Shang-Chi will battle in an underground tournament to earn the Ten Rings for The Mandarin. And one of the opponents in this contest is reported to be a former Widow, which could be the agent Xu plays in Black Widow.</p>
<p>This is, of course, just a theory and the opponent in question could easily be any character from Black Widow. There’s a full army of them, after all. Regardless, we’re excited to see Xu in action in the only MCU movie we’re getting this year, though it’d be nice if we could stream it now instead of having to wait.

<h3 id="black-widow-update-is-the-movie-dropping-ahead-release-date-for-nba">&ldquo;‘Black Widow’ update: Is the movie dropping ahead release date for NBA?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://micky.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_48.jpg" alt="img">
Black Widow is set to premiere in November. But it seems like it’s going to drop ahead of its scheduled release date for basketball season.</p>
<p>Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow film is one of the highly-anticipated films this year. It’s the first Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to be released to mark the beginning of Phase Four.</p>
<p>Aside from that, it’s Johansson’s last film for Marvel as she is said to be bidding farewell to her character of 10 years.</p>
<p>That is also why many are really looking forward to watching the prequel film in support of the actress’s last time as Black Widow or Natasha Romanoff.</p>
<p>It’s expected to drop on November 6, 2020, already. However, reports say that a group of people from the NBA may be able to watch it two months prior to the release date.</p>
<p>Entertainment for the athletes</p>
<p>According to Comic Book, NBA is planning to resume its basketball season for an eight-game run before sending 16 teams to the playoffs.</p>
<p>This follows after all sporting events scheduled were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With that being said, the league is working on sending 22 teams to Orlando Florida, which is the host location of the season.</p>
<p>It’s reported to take place at ESPN World Wide Sports at Disney World. And in an effort to maintain safety measures and social distancing, the host has come up with a resolution.</p>
<p>They will be housing the players and staff of the basketball teams at Walt Disney World resorts. And in order to avoid interactions, they will be providing limited access to outside entertainment.</p>
<p>It is said that they may possibly provide the athletes the Marvel’s Black Widow as one of the options for entertainment. This would mean that the movie, which is owned by Disney, will be watched first by players and their families.</p>
<p>“Per Walt Disney World Sources: Disney will make movies available for players and their families (once they join),” NBA insider Kevin Smith tweeted. “This is likely to include movies that have not been released to the general public, including Marvel’s Black Widow.”</p>
<p>Potential spoiler</p>
<p>The potential early release of the movie by Disney comes as a surprise to many. The plot is most certainly expected to leak if it is released ahead of time to a large group of people.</p>
<p>Also, the NBA Finals is set to conclude in September, which is still two months before Black Widow’s current premiere in theaters.</p>
<p>Many are still remembering how NFL bench rider LeSean McCoy shared major spoilers from the Avengers: Endgame movie after watching it ahead of its release.</p>
<p>Since then, Marvel fans are more sensitive to early screenings and many have already voiced out their concern for Black Widow.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/articles/banners/175919.jpg" alt="img">
BLACK WIDOW Actress May Reprise Role From That Film In SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS</p>
<p>Another Marvel Cinematic Universe crossover may have been revealed early, as an actress in Black Widow could be reprising her role from that film in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings next year!</p>
<p>Black Widow releases in theaters this November (we hope), and as we&rsquo;ve seen in the film&rsquo;s trailers, Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova will have to face down an entire army of Black Widows. Playing one of those Red Room warriors is stunt performer Jade Xu, but she&rsquo;s also listed as being part of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. There&rsquo;s also evidence that she&rsquo;s been in Australia for that film&rsquo;s production.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s possible she&rsquo;s doubling for Awkwafina&rsquo;s character Fah Lo Suee (they&rsquo;re the same height and build), there&rsquo;s an entirely more plausible and realistic explanation for why Xu is in both.</p>
<p>Rumor has it Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings will feature the title character battling in an underground tournament to earn the Ten Rings for The Mandarin, and one possible opponent has been named as a former Widow. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s possible Shang-Chi will have to face Xu&rsquo;s unnamed agent from Black Widow in a brutal fight.</p>
<p>Nothing is confirmed, but it&rsquo;s a strong enough theory. Click HERE for more Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings news from CBM!</p>

Actress Scarlett Johansson says stars now are under more pressure to look thin and has described the situation as &ldquo;much worse&rdquo; than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has always been pressure on actors to stay thin. There&rsquo;s a scene in one of my favourite movies, &lsquo;All About Eve&rsquo;, where Bette Davis is circling around the room, horribly upset about something, and she picks up a chocolate&hellip; puts it down&hellip; picks it up again&hellip; puts it down again&hellip; finally, she gives in and eats it, but only after a huge struggle!&rdquo; Johansson told Candis magazine, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

<p><img src="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/articles/banners/175985.jpg" alt="img">
Marvel has released three Serial Box outings this year, including Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood. In support of the new audiobook, we spoke exclusively with the narrator, Sarah Natochenny. Check it out!</p>
<p>2020 has been a big year for Marvel when it comes to audiobooks. Teaming up with Serial Box, the comic company has already launched three new series this year.</p>
<p>First, Marvel&rsquo;s Thor: Metal Gods released, followed by Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood and last month&rsquo;s premiere of Marvel&rsquo;s Jessica Jones: Playing with Fire. Earlier today, we shared comments from our exclusive interview with writer Elsa Sjunneson, who helped contribute to the character of Daredevil in Marvel&rsquo;s Jessica Jones: Playing With Fire. You can read that here in case you missed it.</p>
<p>As a follow up, we also spoke with Sarah Natochenny, the narrator behind Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood. Best known for playing Ash Ketchum in Pokemon for the last fifteen years, she spoke with us about how her roles in animation differ to this role in which she narrates the story.</p>
<p>Check out what the voice actress had to say regarding Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood below!</p>
<p>Joe: I&rsquo;d like to start by asking how you initially became involved with Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood?</p>
<p>Sarah Natochenny: I had worked with a director named Amanda Rose Smith on another Serial Box show called Dead Air two or three years ago, and we remained friends after that.</p>
<p>We went out to see 1917 with a group of friends, and afterward, we went to hang out at my place. We got a little drunk, and we had a great time, and I gave everybody assignments to draw characters that look like butts. And Amanda&rsquo;s was a fabulous one. And somewhere in the midst of that, she said, &lsquo;I think I have something for you, it&rsquo;s Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I had never done an audiobook before, and they intimidated me, so I was nervous. So I went in, and I read, and Amanda directed me and said I was doing great. And Serial Box and Marvel approved, and the next thing I knew, I was doing it.</p>
<p>Joe: I understand that you are the narrator of Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood. Is this your first narration voice role, and how would you say it differs from general voice acting?</p>
<p>Sarah Natochenny: Yes, most of what I do is animation, and I also do commercials. In animation, I&rsquo;ll go line by line, and we&rsquo;ll go back and pick up certain lines.</p>
<p>With an audiobook, I&rsquo;m just reading it straight through. I&rsquo;m not doing different takes unless I get stopped by the director or unless I stop myself if I made a mistake or if I wanted to do a different read on something. So you need more stamina and more focus to do what we&rsquo;re doing here than with commercials and animation.</p>
<p>Joe: What can you tell us about the story of Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood?</p>
<p>Sarah Natochenny: Natasha Romanoff had blood taken from her after trying to live a normal life. So she chases down Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier because the same thing is happening to him. And they team up to find out why because one drop of blood could destroy the world.</p>
<p>Joe: Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood features Bucky Barnes&rsquo; Winter Soldier in addition to Natasha. Does the Red Guardian appear, considering his upcoming debut in the Marvel Studios film scheduled for later this year?</p>
<p>Sarah Natochenny: So, the stories are entirely separate. This audiobook runs independently. I haven&rsquo;t seen the Red Guardian yet in the episodes released so far.</p>
<p>Joe: Is there anything else you would like me to share with your fans regarding your social media accounts or upcoming projects?</p>
<p>Sarah Natochenny: Yeah, sure. Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood Episode 8 just dropped. There are 14 episodes, and they&rsquo;re being dropped weekly on Tuesdays at serialbox.com and the Serial Box app.</p>
<p>The Last Degree of Kevin Bacon is a podcast that I do for Funny or Die with Kevin Bacon, Kiera Sedgewick, and other people.</p>
<p>Pokemon Journeys, the new season is dropping on Netflix on Friday.</p>
<p>And make sure you foster animals! I know it&rsquo;s hard even to get fosters right now, but voicesforfosters.org has a lot of information if you need it.</p>
<p>What do you think of these comments from narrating voice actress Sarah Natochenny? Check out the synopsis for Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood below, and be sure to share your thoughts with us in the usual place!</p>
<p>Someone has stolen the Black Widow’s blood. Now she must find them before it’s too late.</p>
<p>As Natasha Romanoff follows the trail across the globe, she discovers she wasn’t the only target. Whoever is responsible stole Bucky Barnes’ blood, too. And one thing is certain: anyone who wants the blood of the Widow and the Winter Soldier needs to be taken down, and fast.</p>
<p>Despite a tangled web of shared history stretching back to their Red Room days, Barnes and Romanoff must join forces, confronting the demons of their past as they race to protect their future. A single drop of blood could be all it takes to save the world—or destroy it.</p>
<p>The first eight episodes of Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow: Bad Blood are currently available to listen to on Serial Box, with the ninth releasing on June 16th.

<h3 id="scarlett-johansson-isnt-actually-done-playing-black-widow-mcu-fans-speculate">&ldquo;Scarlett Johansson Isn’t Actually Done Playing Black Widow, MCU Fans Speculate&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/scarlett-johansson-1-1024x681.jpg" alt="img">
The conventional wisdom says that when Black Widow finally opens in November, that will be Scarlett Johansson‘s final turn as the character. She died in Avengers: Endgame, but she gets one last go-round with the prequel.</p>
<p>Or is that what’s really going on? Fans have begun to speculate that Black Widow, as played by Johansson, will be back in defiance of the grim reaper. People expect that her movie will make a lot of money, as Marvel movies usually do, and Marvel/Disney won’t be anxious to leave money on the table.</p>
<p>People are still recovering from Black Widow’s death</p>

<p>Before Avengers: Endgame came out last year, fans expected some major characters were going to die, but Black Widow was not one of the top predictions. After all, fans knew she had her standalone movie coming in 2020 — and that movie had already been a long time coming — too long, if you ask many fans.</p>
<p>So when Natasha sacrificed herself so Clint (Hawkeye) could get the Soul Stone, fans were shocked and even angry. This meant her movie would have to be a prequel, which may not have been an issue anyway, but fans thought her farewell got the short end of the stick, especially compared to the moving farewells Captain America and especially Iron Man got.</p>
<p>Some people pointed out that the Avengers’ reaction to Natasha’s passing reflected the five stages of grief: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Many fans are still stuck between anger and bargaining, trying to think of ways Johansson could continue with the role.</p>
<p>What do fans say about Scarlett Johansson coming back?</p>
<p>Scarlett Johansson has admitted that she &ldquo;would’ve been happy to end it at #Endgame and walk away&rdquo; from the #BlackWidow character, but instead, chose to return for her standalone movie to &ldquo;elevate the genre!&rdquo; https://t.co/WpHIIrK112 pic.twitter.com/jkF8VyEa0o — MCU Direct (@MCU_Direct) July 25, 2019</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘Black Widow’ Star Scarlett Johansson Clapped Back at Reporter Who Asked About Her Underwear: ‘What Kind of Interview Is This?’</p>
<p>A topic-starter on Reddit asked: “Anyone else think there’s gonna a Black Widow trilogy with the next two sequels starring Florence Pugh?”</p>
<p>One fan responded, “Boring answer, but I imagine it has a lot to do with the critical and commercial success of the movie when it is released. This whole phase seems like they’re throwing a lot of IP (intellectual property) out there so they can build around what people respond to.”</p>
<p>At the same time, fans thought the way forward didn’t necessarily preclude Johansson. One fan said, “I bet(Kevin) Feige has something interesting up his sleeve that will give SJ/BW her due. I don’t think SJ is done with the role quite yet.” And a response to that was, “I’m in the same boat as you. I think the end of the movie will have some twist that keeps her around like the Hulk’s snap actually working.”</p>
<p>It’s a little hard to imagine how that could take place in a prequel, although Marvel might be able to get away with it in one of their famous end credits sequences. Johansson is coming off a banner year, having not only starred in the most successful movie of all time, but having gotten two Oscar nominations, for Jojo Rabbit and Marriage Story.</p>
<p>That could indicate she’s ready to move on, but even if she does, there may or may not be someone waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Is Florence Pugh the new Black Widow or not?</p>
<p>Like Johansson, Florence Pugh had a banner year last year as well, having starred in three acclaimed movies: Fighting with My Family, Midsommar and Little Women.</p>
<p>Pugh was Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actress (for Little Women) alongside Johansson. So it would make for fun synergy if Pugh were to become the new Black Widow. Pugh plays Yelena, who is one of the Black Widows in the comics.</p>
<p>Except Pugh herself has cast doubt on that, saying that the movie wasn’t really designed to be a passing of the torch. Screen Rant quoted her as saying: “No, I actually will say when we were making it, it wasn’t anything like that at all. And I am saying it very honestly, it certainly didn’t feel like a passing of the torch kind of film when we were making it.”</p>
<p>Given all the potential with Pugh, it would seem like a missed opportunity for Marvel not to move forward with her in some way. As the fans said, it all depends on how well the movie does when it opens in November.</p>
<p>Fans have been waiting 10 years for a Black Widow movie, so maybe it won’t hurt too much to wait five more months to see what will happen with her particular part of the franchise.
