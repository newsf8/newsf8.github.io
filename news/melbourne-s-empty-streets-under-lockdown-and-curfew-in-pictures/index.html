The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced tough new stage four restrictions for metropolitan Melbourne, including an overnight curfew</p>
<p>Stage four restrictions have been introduced across metropolitan Melbourne from Sunday 2 August for six weeks.</p>
<p>Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said the restrictions have been brought in to get community transmission – cases where the source of the transmission cannot be determined – under control. Andrews said government modelling showed that without these measures, stage three restrictions would need to last six months.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main things you need to know about the stage four restrictions for Melbourne.</p>
<p>When does the lockdown start?</p>
<p>The stage four restrictions covering metropolitan Melbourne run from Sunday 2 August and will last for six weeks until Sunday 13 September.</p>
<p>Additional restrictions on businesses were announced on Monday 3 August, and most of them will start from 12.01 Thursday 6 August. Andrews also said further details will be announced throughout the week.</p>
<p>When can I leave my house?</p>
<p>You are only allowed to leave your house for four reasons: shopping for food and essential items, care and caregiving, daily exercise and work. Employers must support you to work from home if you can work from home.</p>
<p>Unlike stage three, there is now a curfew on Melbourne residents between 8pm and 5am.</p>
<p>Caregiving includes managing shared custody arrangements, using a babysitter, leaving home to care for animals housed elsewhere, visiting someone in an aged care home and visiting someone in hospital. Specific directions apply.</p>
<p>You can leave your house if you are at risk of family violence or to apply for an intervention order, and to attend court or a police station.</p>
<p>You can also leave your house to access medical services. This time around, that explicitly includes leaving your house to give blood. Access to medical services is unrestricted: you can access them anywhere in Victoria.</p>
<p>How far can I travel from home?</p>
<p>Shopping for food and necessary supplies must be within 5km distance from your home, except if the nearest supermarket is further than 5km.</p>
<p>Only one person per household can leave to go shopping per day.</p>
<p>Exercise must take place within 5km of home, and must be in metropolitan Melbourne. Exercise is limited to one hour, once per day.</p>
<p>What are the rules for wearing masks?</p>
<p>It has been mandatory for people in metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell shire to wear face coverings in public since midnight on Wednesday 22 July. That rule is extended to the entire state from midnight Sunday 2 August.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s Covid-19 face mask advice: are reusable or washable masks best, and what are the rules? Read more</p>
<p>People must wear a mask or covering whenever leaving the house. There are a few exceptions. People with a medical reason are exempt, as are children younger than 12. Those who have a professional reason are also exempt and “if it’s just not practical, like when running”, but those people will still be expected to carry a face covering at all times “to wear when you can”.</p>
<p>In schools, teachers will not need to wear a face covering while teaching, but students attending classes will. Both teachers and students will need to wear a mask on the way to and from school.</p>
<p>Andrews said “common sense” would guide how the new rules are enforced.</p>
<p>Breaking the rules is punishable with a $200 fine.</p>
<p>Is my municipality included?</p>
<p>All local government areas within metropolitan Melbourne will be affected. That includes:</p>
<p>Banyule, Hume, Moreland, Bayside, Kingston, Mornington Peninsula, Boroondara, Knox, Nillumbik, Brimbank, Manningham, Port Phillip, Cardinia, Maribyrnong, Stonnington, Casey, Maroondah, Whitehorse, Darebin, Melbourne, Whittlesea, Frankston, Melton, Wyndham, Glen Eira, Monash, Yarra, Greater Dandenong, Moonee Valley, Yarra Ranges, Hobsons Bay.</p>
<p>Regional Victoria will return to stage three restrictions from Wednesday. You can find out more about stage three here.</p>
<p>Can I have visitors to my house? Can I see my partner?</p>
<p>You cannot have visitors or go to another person’s house unless it is for the purpose of giving or receiving care. You can leave your house to visit a person if you are in an “intimate personal relationship” with them, even during curfew hours. That is, there is no “bonk ban”.</p>
<p>If your partner lives outside Melbourne and/or 5km of your home you can still visit them.</p>
<p>Cleaners, tradespeople, gardeners, painters and renovators are not allowed to visit your house for work. Exceptions exist for emergency issues like a burst pipe, and for providing care for welfare and wellbeing like Meals on Wheels . But “it’s not the time to be painting your house or having unnecessary, non-urgent work happen,” Andrews said on Monday.</p>
<p>Do I have to stay in Melbourne?</p>
<p>The stay-at-home rules apply to your main place of residence so you will not be able to get out of Melbourne and stay in your holiday house. The government says this is to stop the virus being spread to other parts of the state.</p>
<p>Can I still dine in at a restaurant or cafe?</p>
<p>No. Restaurants and cafes will only be able to trade as takeaway and delivery businesses.</p>
<p>Will the shops be open?</p>
<p>Supermarkets, grocery stores, bottle shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, banks, and local bakers and butchers will be allowed to trade but subject to density rules limited by people per square metre.</p>
<p>General retail will be closed from 12.01 Thursday 6 August. Stores will still be allowed to operate contactless pick-up, delivery and “click and collect”. Hardware stores will be open to tradespeople only.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, you will only be allowed to go to the shops to buy food and essential items. If you need help with shopping, or need to help a friend or family member, you can go shopping together but remain 1.5m apart.</p>
<p>What about other businesses and services?</p>
<p>Pubs, bars and nightclubs will be closed and bottle shops will be takeaway only. Beauty services will be closed, but hairdressers will remain open.</p>
<p>Entertainment and cultural venues such as music venues, museums, indoor and outdoor cinemas, and the casino will be shut. Brothels and strip clubs will also shut. Libraries and community venues can only stay open for essential services, or to host funerals.</p>
<p>Real estate inspections will be by appointment only and auctions will be conducted remotely.</p>
<p>What are the changes to warehouses and abattoirs?</p>
<p>Warehouses (in Melbourne) will be limited to two-thirds of their normal workforce onsite at any time from Thursday 6 August.</p>
<p>Abattoirs (across all of Victoria) will also be limited to two-thirds of their normal workforce, with strict safety measures in place akin to being a frontline health worker.</p>
<p>What is happening to construction?</p>
<p>Major private construction projects will be limited to only 25% of their normal workforce onsite from Thursday 6 August.</p>
<p>Small construction, such as home renovations or new homes, will be limited to only five people onsite. Government construction projects have already halved the number of people onsite, and the government is looking to reduce them on a project-by-project basis.</p>
<p>What are the rules for exercise?</p>
<p>Exercise is still a permitted reason to leave your house. But you will not be allowed to leave metropolitan Melbourne to exercise, meaning long bush walks or leaving Melbourne to go fishing or surfing are no longer permitted.</p>
<p>Exercise can only happen within 5km of home, and must be in metropolitan Melbourne. Exercise is limited to one hour, once per day.</p>
<p>Swimming pools, playgrounds and gyms will be shut, and community sport will also stop.</p>
<p>You can exercise with one other person, including members of your household. You can also hire a personal trainer.</p>
<p>What is happening with schools?</p>
<p>Year 11 and 12 students, along with all other students, will return to remote learning from Wednesday across Victoria, except for children of permitted workers and vulnerable children.</p>
<p>Childcare and kinder will be closed except for children of permitted workers and vulnerable children.</p>
<p>What happens to weddings, funerals or religious services?</p>
<p>Religious services will need to be broadcast online. Weddings will no longer be permitted from Thursday, 6 August, while the limit will be 10 people at funerals (not including those conducting the service).</p>
<p>Holiday accomodation and camping venues must close. Travel within Victoria is allowed only for work and only if necessary.</p>
<p>Can I travel to Melbourne?</p>
<p>You cannot travel to Melbourne unless it’s for work or study, medical care and caregiving, shopping for food or supplies. Exercise is not a valid reason to travel.</p>
<p>You can travel through Melbourne on your way to somewhere else, but it’s recommended you don’t stop unless it’s for one of those three reasons.</p>
<p>What if I break the rules?</p>
<p>Andrews has said police will monitor traffic seeking to leave metropolitan Melbourne and officers would also enforce the restrictions within the city. Victoria police can issue on-the-spot fines of up to $1,652 for individuals and up to $9,913 to businesses.</p>
<p>Andrews indicated more penalties were being considered.

Woolworths will transform three Melbourne supermarkets into online delivery hubs as the city enters stage four lockdown today.</p>
<p>The supermarket giant will temporarily close its Dandenong Plaza, Watergardens South and Mountain Gate stores from tomorrow at 7.45pm to fulfil online grocery deliveries until further notice.</p>
<p>Woolworths stated the stores had been &ldquo;carefully picked&rdquo; to minimise the impact on shoppers. They had also been selected as there were alternative stores within five kilometres.</p>

<p>There would be no impact on jobs as a consequence of the conversions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This week we&rsquo;ll be converting three of our Melbourne stores to online delivery hubs to help meet this demand and support the most vulnerable in the community,&rdquo; Woolworths Victorian General Manager Andrew Hall said.

With Victorians living under the toughest Covid-19 restrictions to date, we’d love to hear from you about how you’re coping under the new rules</p>
<p>Open thread: how are you feeling under lockdown in Melbourne?</p>
<p>Almost five million Victorians are now living amid the tightest coronavirus restrictions ever imposed in Australia – restrictions which will test people’s mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
<p>The lockdown, which has been applied to Melbourne, will confine residents to their homes from 8pm to 5am (they can leave for medical reasons or for essential work) and imposes fines of $1,652 if they break curfew. Just one person in a household will be allowed to go to the supermarket, and only once a day, wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Melbourne stage 4 restrictions and coronavirus lockdown rules explained Read more</p>
<p>Exercise will be limited to once a day and no straying further than 5km from home.</p>
<p>There will be more police and army personnel enforcing the restrictions, and children will be stuck at home with schools and childcare shut.</p>
<p>Entire workplaces will be shut down with a huge impact on businesses and employees.</p>
<p>Messages of support for those doing it tough have been pouring in from other parts of Australia, but for many, the reality is grim. Life is on hold, work is scarce and it is the depths of winter.</p>
<p>If you are in Melbourne, how are you feeling living under the restrictions? What ways have you found to cope?</p>

Sydney and Melbourne house values tumbled through July with warnings the reduction of government and private bank support through the final three months of the year could weaken the property market even further.</p>
<p>CoreLogic on Monday reported that Sydney house values dropped by 1 per cent last month to be down 2.4 per cent over the quarter. Despite the drop, Sydney values are still up by 13.2 per cent over the past year.</p>

The National Basketball League has announced 12 players have coronavirus in the wake of Melbourne United stars testing positive last week.</p>
<p>The outbreak has put both of Victoria’s NBL teams - the other being South East Melbourne Phoenix - into lockdown.</p>
<p>United and South East Melbourne players and staff have been in isolation and will remain that way amid Victoria’s coronavirus disaster, with Phoenix players also undergoing testing.</p>
<p>It comes after the league last week confirmed United players Mitch McCarron and Jo Lual-Acui had tested positive.</p>
<p>“Our primary concern is the health and welfare of our players, staff and their families,” NBL Commissioner Jeremy Loeliger said.</p>
<p>“This is a challenging time for everyone concerned and we are working closely with the clubs and the Australian Basketball Players’ Association to provide support for all those affected.</p>

<p>“We are also working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services to manage the outbreak and limit any risk to the wider community.”</p>
<p>There will be no further group training sessions for United or Phoenix until further notice.</p>
<p>The 2020-21 NBL season is scheduled to tip off in December.
