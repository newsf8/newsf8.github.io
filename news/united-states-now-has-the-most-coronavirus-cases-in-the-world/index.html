The United States now has the most reported coronavirus cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy, with the three countries accounting for almost half of the world&rsquo;s infections.</p>
<p>The US has registered nearly 86,000 cases, including fewer than 800 recoveries, while China counted about 81,000 cases, more than 74,000 of which had already recovered, according to data collected by the Johns Hopkins University in the US. For its part, Italy has logged more than 80,000 cases, with 10,360 recoveries and some 8,200 deaths.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>The US has registered about 1,300 deaths, almost a quarter of them in New York City, where hospitals are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>In China, where the virus was believed to have been transferred from wild animals to humans, the National Health Commission on Friday reported 55 new cases, including 54 it said were imported infections in recent arrivals from overseas.</p>
<p>There were no new cases reported in Wuhan, the provincial capital where the coronavirus is reported to have emerged from late last year.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump, who had until recently insisted on calling the new coronavirus the &ldquo;Chinese virus&rdquo;, tweeted on Friday that he and China&rsquo;s President Xi Jinping had &ldquo;a very good conversation&rdquo; and discussed &ldquo;in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>The economic damage from the pandemic was growing as a record-shattering 3.3 million US citizens applied for unemployment benefits in a single week - nearly five times the old record, set in 1982.</p>
<p>Job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation, as nearly half of the country has closed to non-essential businesses.</p>
<p>200126061554884</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers. They will get worse, unfortunately,&rdquo; New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work.</p>
<p>But stock markets continued to climb on Friday, with Asian bourses in the green after a third straight day of rises on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Traders have taken heart from the passage through the Senate of a $2 trillion stimulus bill - the largest in US history, which will support the country&rsquo;s businesses and provide cash payouts to people.</p>
<p>The rescue plan, which is expected to be voted on in the House of Representatives on Friday, would initially dispense cheques of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for Covid-19 just over a fortnight ago on 12 March. Thankfully, he has made a full recovery. Arteta said one of his biggest fears was the possibility that he might infect members of his squad. &ldquo;I am feeling completely recovered,&rdquo; he told the club&rsquo;s website. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true I started having some symptoms when we got the phone call from the club [Olympiacos] to let us know that we might be exposed to the virus&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, I felt something within me, that I had it. Then you realise: &lsquo;Wow, everybody can be exposed here, this is very serious&rsquo; and you start to think about the people that you&rsquo;ve been in contact with and the other people that can be related to us. That&rsquo;s when a bit of fear comes. In terms of symptoms, it was a normal virus for me. I had three or four days which were a little bit difficult, with a bit of a temperature and a dry cough, and some discomfort in my chest. That was it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulty is that I have people at home, three kids as well, and I was worried. My wife has been through it and my nanny&rsquo;s been through it. Thank God, the kids never got it. We are all completely fine now.&rdquo;

<h3 id="usda-admits-it-may-be-misleading-consumers-with-product-of-usa-labeling">USDA admits it may be misleading consumers with ‘Product of USA’ labeling</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2020/03/USA1200X680.jpg" alt="img">
USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service admitted Thursday it may be misleading consumers about where their meat comes from. The admission came in response to a petition filed by the United States Cattlemen’s Association about accurate labeling.</p>
<p>“After considering the supporting information included in the petition, along with the supporting public comments, FSIS has concluded that permitting imported meat products that are further processed in a federally-inspected establishment to be labeled ‘Product of USA’ may be misleading to consumers and may not meet consumer expectations of what ‘Product of USA’ signifies. FSIS also agrees that to address these issues, the agency needs to establish clear parameters that prescribe which meat product may voluntarily be labeled with U.S. origin statements, such as ‘Product of USA’ or ‘Made in the USA.’ “</p>
<p>The USCA’s petition requested FSIS to amend the agency’s Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book to provide that any beef labeled as “Made in the USA”, “Product of the USA”, “USA Beef”, or in any other manner that suggests that the origin is the United States be derived from cattle that have been born, raised, and slaughtered in the U.S.</p>
<p>But FSIS says it might be in a quandary.</p>
<p>“In addition, as part of its review, FSIS also considered the comments that did not support the petition. After considering these comments, FSIS has concluded that that the concerns expressed about measures that could potentially affect the integrated livestock supply chains between the United States and Canada, as well as the integrated cattle supply chain between the United States and Mexico, have merit,” the FSIS response continues. “As noted in the petition and the public comments, Canada exports a significant number of live cattle, hogs, sheep, and goats to the United States every year for slaughter and processing, and Mexico exports a large number of cattle to the United States to be fed, slaughtered, and processed. Thus, many official U.S. slaughter and processing establishments use Canadian and Mexican cattle as the source animals for their meat and meat products.”</p>
<p>After receiving the response to their petition, USCA leaders said the organization appreciates FSIS for responding to and acknowledging many points within the petition.</p>
<p>“Specifically, FSIS acknowledged USCA’s blueprint in regards to addressing the loopholes that exist within the current labeling system, and that the current consumer confusion in the marketplace is a direct result of these inaccurate labels,” the statement said. “However, as a part of the open rulemaking process, FSIS considered all of the comments submitted in response to USCA’s petition. A number of those comments were from industry and corporations who have long opposed accurate labeling in regards to ‘U.S. Beef’, and that is reflected in FSIS’s comments.”</p>
<p>In response to the comments in opposition to USCA’s petition, FSIS will now consider a second rulemaking that will:</p>
<p>“. . . limit “Product of USA” and certain other voluntary U.S. origin statements to the labeling of meat products from livestock that were slaughtered and processed in the United States. The Agency has determined that a voluntary U.S. meat product origin labeling policy that focusses on where the product is made, i.e., where the livestock are slaughtered and processed, without regard to where the source animals were born, may more accurately reflect what ‘origin’ means with respect to meat products processed in the United States and will thus result in labels that are truthful and not misleading.”</p>
<p>Responding to the USCA petition, FSIS has acknowledged the problem of current consumer confusion in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The USCA leaders say Congress needs to step in to resolve the labeling debate.</p>
<p>Cattlemen fear the second round of rulemaking will effectively take producers out of the equation when it comes to the labeling of U.S. beef products as FSIS will look to redefine the term “origin,” to instead refer to packing houses or processing facilities, rather than ranches of origin.</p>
<p>“The true origin of any beef product is with the producer, and USCA will continue to work with Congress on a path forward to ensure this information is acknowledged and communicated effectively to the consumer,” it says.</p>
