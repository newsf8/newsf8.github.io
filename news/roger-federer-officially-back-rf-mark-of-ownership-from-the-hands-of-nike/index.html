<p>The ATP’s decision to freeze world rankings amid the coronavirus pandemic has sparked controversy around Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.</p>
<p>Djokovic is nearing Federer’s all-time record for total weeks at World No.1 (310).</p>
<p>‘STAY INSIDE’: Kyrgios&rsquo; cheeky dig at female star&rsquo;s bikini pic</p>
<p>‘HUGE WAKE-UP CALL’: Tennis rocked by first positive virus test</p>
<p>Currently at 281 weeks, Djokovic has previously made it clear that snaring Federer’s record is one of his goals for 2020.</p>
<p>But with rankings frozen and no tennis for the foreseeable future, debate is raging about whether Djokovic’s weeks should continue to accumulate.</p>
<p>The ATP and WTA recently extended the suspension of their tours until June 7, adding another 12 weeks onto his tally.</p>
<p>But with no one able to play due to the shutdown, should those weeks count?</p>
<p>According to coach and ESPN analyst Brad Gilbert they should.</p>
<p>“He earned the ranking, and he was going to be No.1 for a while even if things went on as normal,” Gilbert told ESPN.</p>
<p>“Going into Indian Wells, Djokovic was going to stay No.1 by the end, unless he lost before the semis and Rafa won the tournament.”</p>
<p>Darren Cahill, Aussie coach of Simona Halep, echoed that sentiment.</p>
<p>“[Djokovic should get that credit] until the next major, and then I&rsquo;m a bit unsure of what is the right thing to do,” Cahill said.</p>
<p>“These weeks he would have retained the No.1. The same goes for [Ashleigh] Barty.”</p>
<p>But as Gilbert predicted, fans aren’t happy with that stance.</p>
<p>This period definitely should not count for anybody — pointsintheair (@pointsintheair) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>@DjokerNole No. No he doesn’t get the record without earning it. That is a disgrace. What happened if he play an lost. That is ridiculous — IBTurner (@SABrinson) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>👍absolutely. He could have lost no 1 after Indian Wells. Terrible take by Brad! — KeiraEve (@tohabebj) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>Agree. The weeks when tennis was put on hold should not be counted. — FAMA (@apoyarenas) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>Weeks count will be frozen as long as the tour is suspended. It&rsquo;s a no brainer — Alessandro Villa (@alevilla1978) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>Surely he can’t get points when the tournaments aren’t being played?! That’s not fair on Rafa 😡 — Lana Angel Nadal (@Rafasgirlalways) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>You mean, if points are frozen - which is wrong - why not fix it with a second wrong - freeze weeks at no. 1. — C Kristjánsdóttir ●🐊 (@CristinaNcl) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>If rankings are frozen so should weeks at number 1 — sportbox (@Sport47465366) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>Djokovic was likely to retain No.1 anyway</p>
<p>Djokovic currently holds a 370-point edge over World No.2 Rafael Nadal in the rankings - 10,220 points to 9,850.</p>
<p>However Nadal would have been asked to defend 4260 points through June 7, while Djokovic was only defending 2635, making it highly likely that Djokovic would have retained the No.1 spot anyway.</p>
<p>After undergoing minor keen surgery last month, Federer was facing the prospect of dropping from World No.3 to the lower half of the top 10.</p>
<p>But with rankings frozen he will remain at World No.4 until he returns.</p>
<p>Both ATP and WTA rankings work on a points system that requires players to ‘defend’ the points they earned at events the previous year.</p>
<p>For example, if Barty fails to defend her French Open title in 2020 she will lose points because she won the event in 2019.</p>
<p>Barty is also seemingly benefiting from the suspension of the tennis tours.</p>
<p>The Aussie was facing a tough task to retain her 2500-point buffer as World No.1 over the next three months after she earned around 40 percent of her ranking points throughout the same stretch in 2019.

<p>Roger Federer and his wife Mirka have opened up their hearts and wallets to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic in their native Switzerland.</p>
<p>The 20-time grand slam champion has joined the ever-expanding list of sporting stars to dig deep into their bank balances to help provide crucial finances for the fight against the global pandemic.</p>
<p>‘STAY INSIDE’: Kyrgios&rsquo; cheeky dig at female star&rsquo;s bikini pic</p>
<p>‘PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES’: NBA star&rsquo;s coronavirus heartbreak</p>
<p>Federer has generously decided to donate 1 million Swiss Francs ($A1.7 million) for vulnerable families in Switzerland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are challenging times for everyone and nobody should be left behind,&rdquo; Federer wrote in a statement posted on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mirka and I have personally decided to donate one million Swiss Francs for the most vulnerable families in Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Federer&rsquo;s native Switzerland is home to one of the ten worst outbreaks on the planet, with more than 10,000 confirmed cases and over 100 reported deaths.</p>
<p>The Swiss government initiated a lockdown on March 16, closing all restaurants, bars, and schools, in addition to cancelling public gatherings and restricting international travel in the hopes of slowing the spread of the deadly virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must help families in need quickly and unbureaucratically,&rdquo; Federer added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mirka and I have donated to a newly established emergency assistance fund for families in Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our contribution is just a start. We hope that others might join in supporting more families in need. Together we can overcome this crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Federer, a 20-times Grand Slam winner, is currently recovering from a knee surgery he underwent last month and was targeting a return in June in time for Wimbledon.</p>
<p>The tennis season is, however, suspended until June 7 due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Federer urges fans to take safety measures seriously</p>
<p>COVID-19 has infected more than 436,000 people and killed more than 19,600 across the world since it was first identified in China in December.</p>
<p>Federer has been vocal in preaching safety precautions over coronavirus, posting a video earlier in the week to urge people to take the safety precautions extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Roger Federer posted a passionate message on Instagram about fighting COVID-19 together. Pic: Instagram/Getty More</p>
<p>He said it was important for communities to look out for one another in such a time of crisis, particularly those at the greatest risk such as the elderly.</p>
<p>“I’m also staying home, and I haven’t been shaking anybody’s hands for quite some time now,” Federer said.</p>
<p>“I wash my hands very frequently as we’re supposed to. I believe helping each other is more important now than ever, especially because we want to help the older generation.</p>
<p>“They’re the ones at highest risk, and we need to help them by keeping a distance of two metres and not shake hands.</p>
<p>“It’s really important to take these rules seriously. Very very seriously.</p>
<p>“Eventually, we could all be in quarantine and not be able to leave the house anymore, so I really hope all of us take it very seriously.”</p>
<p>Football stars also make huge coronavirus donations</p>
<p>Like Federer, stars from the football world, such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, have also made massive donations to health institutions battling the pandemic.</p>
<p>Ronaldo and super agent Jorge Mendes have donated €1 million ($A 1.8 million) to help three intensive care units (ICUs) in their native Portugal.</p>

<p>The pair’s donation will go towards buying crucial equipment for ICUs at Lisbon’s Santa Maria Hospital and the Santo Antonio hospital in Porto.</p>
