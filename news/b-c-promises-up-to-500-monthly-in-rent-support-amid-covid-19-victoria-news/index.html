The B.C. government is offering up to $500 in rent supplement payments for each of the next four months to help people stay in their homes as their income is affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Premier John Horgan announced the rent supplement plan March 25, along with a freeze on rent increases and most evictions. Horgan warned that the new fund is reserved for people who have lost their jobs, had hours cut or are confined at home due to the virus threat.</p>
<p>“If you can pay your rent, you should pay your rent,” Horgan said.</p>
<p>Like the $1,000 relief for laid-off people B.C. announced earlier in the coronavirus emergency, Horgan said eligibility will depend on being eligible for the federal government’s Employment Insurance expansion. Layoff notices or other documentation will be required.</p>
<p>The application process through B.C. Housing is still “a work in progress,” Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Selina Robinson said.</p>

<p>Horgan said he is aware that April rent is due soon and $500 is only part of the solution for many renters. He urged people to work with landlords, such as temporarily using damage deposits.</p>
<p>“We can’t guarantee it will be in their pockets by April 1,” Horgan said. “We are going to get the resources into people’s hands as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>The program will be funded out of the $5 billion aid package the B.C. legislature approved in an emergency session March 22.</p>
<p>Evictions under the residential tenancy regulations will not go ahead unless there are issues of safety involved, said Vancouver-West End MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert, the B.C. government’s advisor on rental housing.</p>
<p>B.C. Housing administers existing rent supplements and will send the new payments directly to landlords. Robinson said that is the fastest way to deliver the support and also helps landlords make their mortgage payments during a critical time.</p>
<p>“We’re helping renters pay rent and giving them the peace of mind that they have a stable home in these unprecedented times, and ensuring that landlords can count on some rental income right now to keep them afloat too,” Robinson said.</p>
<p>Horgan called on financial institutions to provide some flexibility on mortgages to allow time for the aid to reach people from the federal and provincial governments, and the COVID-19 pandemic to work its way through and allow normal life again.</p>

<h3 id="eviction-ban-500-monthly-for-renters-in-bcs-pandemic-housing-plan">Eviction Ban, $500 Monthly for Renters in BC’s Pandemic Housing Plan</h3>
<p><img src="https://thetyee.ca/News/2020/03/25/SelinaRobinsonPodium.jpg" alt="img">
The B.C. government has put a moratorium on evictions, banned rent increases and is offering up to $500 a month to help renters affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Premier John Horgan said health officials are telling everyone to stay home as much as possible in order to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“We don’t want people to think they might lose that home as a result of this pandemic,” he said today. Horgan said he had received 17,000 emails in recent weeks about housing concerns.</p>
<p>The payments will be administered through BC Housing and are on top of previously announced aid from the federal and provincial government.</p>
<p>People who qualify for help through the federal Employment Insurance program by showing they’ve been financially affected by COVID-19 will be eligible for the temporary rent supplement, which will be paid directly to their landlords. The aid is scheduled to continue for four months.</p>
<p>The province did not announce aid for people struggling to make mortgage payments, but Horgan expressed hope that financial institutions will see the wisdom of doing what they can to help people through a tough time.</p>
<p>He also said the housing measures complement the $2,000 and $1,000 monthly payments already offered by the federal and provincial governments respectively to people who have lost income due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Horgan said the province’s plan is based on all 500,000 renting households claiming the temporary rent supplement payments, but that the program can be extended if not everyone makes a claim.</p>
<p>“If you can pay your rent, you should pay your rent,” he said.</p>
<p>The province also announced that it is freezing rent increases that would have been allowed April 1 and is halting evictions except in cases where there’s a need to protect health and safety or to prevent undue damage to a property, including those where the Residential Tenancy Branch has already issued notices.</p>
<p>It is also giving landlords the ability to restrict access to common areas in buildings, allowing measures like reducing the numbers of people allowed in laundry rooms or closing games rooms, and to bar visitors. Renters will also be able to prevent landlords from entering their units except in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>Housing Minister Selina Robinson said those measures would help renters and landowners maintain physical distancing.</p>
<p>Last week B.C. announced a moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent from BC Housing-funded residences.</p>
<p>The Angus Reid Institute released results of a new Canada-wide poll today that found layoffs and shutdowns were hitting those least likely to be able to afford it. Some 44 per cent of Canadians reported they or someone in their household had lost hours due to the downturn, the pollster said.</p>
<p>About a third of respondents said their household had already or would soon miss a rent or mortgage payment or have to borrow money. (The survey of 1,664 Canadian adults had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent 19 times out of 20.)

<h3 id="covid-19-bc-making-500-a-month-available-to-renters">COVID-19: B.C. making $500 a month available to renters</h3>
<p><img src="https://postmediavancouversun2.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/1118_housing_conference_cutline-w.jpg" alt="img">
The B.C. government will be offering $500 a month to help renters dealing with a loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The supplemental funds will be available through B.C. Housing for the next four months and paid directly to landlords when a tenant cannot pay rent.</p>
<p>“We are doing everything we can to make sure that if (people) are sick or self-isolating, or if they have had their hours cut back or they were laid off that they would not be fearful of losing their home,” B.C. Premier John Horgan said.</p>
<p>Horgan said only people unable to pay their rent should apply for the rental supplement.</p>
<p>“The fewer people who access the program, the more opportunity we have to expand it,” said Horgan, noting there are about 500,000 renters in B.C. “I appeal to those who have perhaps savings accrued … and can continue to keep themselves going in the short term, please do so, so that we can make sure we target resources where they’re most needed.”</p>
<p>The province is also ordering a suspension of evictions, including those in progress already — and putting a full freeze on rental increases — until the crisis has passed.</p>
<p>B.C. joined Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island and the Northwest Territories in banning evictions resulting from non-payment of rent.</p>
<p>People are being told to self-isolate at home during the pandemic and the possibility of being evicted must be prevented, Horgan said.</p>
<p>Holly Popenia, a lawyer with the Community Legal Assistance Society representing tenants advocacy groups, says the moratorium on evictions is welcome news for renters but she wonders what will happened once the COVID-19 crisis is over.</p>
<p>“What happens to tenants who were unable to make their rent payments during the crisis? Will they be on the hook for all this rent?” Popenia asked. “Will evictions that were currently underway before this suspension continue immediately after? What’s the timeline for getting back to business?”</p>
<p>LeadNow, a Canadian citizens advocacy group, also applauded Horgan’s eviction freeze, but said the government’s $500 rental supplement doesn’t go far enough.</p>
<p>“We’ve been overwhelmed with messages from tenants who don’t know how they’re going to afford rent next month. With some of the most expensive rents in the country, $500 doesn’t go far enough for renters in B.C. No one should have to choose between spreading the COVID-19 virus and paying rent,” Leadnow senior campaigner Claire Gallagher said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Tenants need an immediate suspension of rent payments from April 1 until they can safely go back to work.”</p>
<p>Horgan acknowledged that $500 doesn’t go a long way in B.C.’s pricey rental market, but said the money fills a gap along with Employment Insurance benefits, the federal government’s just announced $2,000-a-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit, and the province’s one-time, $1,000 B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers payment.</p>
<p>Spencer Chandra Herbert, the legislature member for Vancouver-West End, said he consulted tenant and landlord organizations to get input on the needs of landlords and tenants during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’ve been clear that no one will lose their housing because of COVID-19,” said Herbert, a New Democrat. “The stress is off the charts right now. We need to give people security.”</p>
<p>Housing Minister Selina Robinson said tenants and landlords must talk to each other to find ways to cover rents and get through the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It’s about the people we love,” she said. “It’s about our families. It is about our neighbours. It is about our communities.”</p>
<p>David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, says the moratorium on evictions opens up a huge risk for rental providers.</p>
<p>“We are at risk here of having a whole bunch of renters not paying their rent on April 1, whether they can afford it or not,” said Hutniak.</p>
<p>“We shared the premier’s concern that we need people housed during this crisis, but I think the unintended consequences of that decision are going to be deeply felt (by landlords). Whether you are a small landlord or a big landlord, you have a mortgage and you’ve got expenses to cover. (Horgan) is suggesting that he expects banks and lending institutions to be sensitive to landlords by deferring mortgage payments, but that doesn’t guarantee us anything or provide us with any protection. It’s dependent upon the banks, whether or not they want to do that. No one’s compelling them to do that.”</p>
<p>Under the plan, landlords are also prevented from entering rental units without the consent of a tenant, unless there is a need to protect someone’s health and safety or to prevent damage to a unit.</p>
<p>Landlords will also be allowed to restrict the use of common areas by tenants or guests to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The full list of immediate rental/housing measures includes:</p>
<p>• The new temporary rent supplement will provide up to $500 per month, paid directly to landlords;</p>
<p>• Halting evictions by ensuring a landlord may not issue a new notice to end tenancy for any reason. However, in exceptional cases where it may be needed to protect health and safety or to prevent undue damage to the property, landlords will be able to apply to the Residential Tenancy Branch for a hearing;</p>
<p>• Halting the enforcement of existing eviction notices issued by the tenancy branch, except in extreme cases where there are safety concerns. The smaller number of court-ordered evictions are up to the courts, which operate independently of government.</p>
<p>• Freezing new annual rent increases during the state of emergency;</p>
<p>• Preventing landlords from accessing rental units without the consent of the tenant (for example, for showings or routine maintenance), except in exceptional cases where it’s needed to protect health and safety or to prevent undue damage to the unit;</p>
<p>• Restricting methods that renters and landlords can use to serve notices to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19 (no personal service and allowing email);</p>
<p>• Allowing landlords to restrict the use of common areas by tenants or guests to protect against the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
