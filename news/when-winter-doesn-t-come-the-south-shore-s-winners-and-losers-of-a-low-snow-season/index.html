<p>It&rsquo;s been one of the warmest, driest winters on record in Greater Boston. People are cheering for the sun, but hardware stores, landscapers and ski areas are a little worse for wear.</p>
<p>It may be a little early to say Mother Nature slept straight through winter on the South Shore, but local public works departments, hardware stores, construction companies and more say they&rsquo;re feeling the effects of high winter temperatures and crazy-low snow totals.</p>
<p>A pair of 70-degree days earlier this year led to Boston&rsquo;s warmest January day in recorded history; hardly any snow fell in LedgerLand in February; and temperatures have topped 120-year monthly averages for the last four months.</p>
<p>While the spring equinox isn&rsquo;t until March 19, experts say they aren&rsquo;t holding their breath for a massive cold front or a major storm anytime soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regarding snowfall, we&rsquo;re pretty much out of the woods,&rdquo; Blue Hill Observatory&rsquo;s Don McCasland said Wednesday. &ldquo;We may get another storm, and for the ski hills&rsquo; and landscapers&rsquo; sake, I hope we do. But there&rsquo;s nothing on the forecast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This winter is the fifth-warmest meteorological winter, which runs from Dec. 1 to Feb. 29, on record for the observatory. The only significant snowfall was 13 inches over the first three days of December. February brought just 0.6 inches of snow, which tied for the second-lowest on record for any February.</p>

<p>So what happens when winter doesn&rsquo;t really come? Well, it depends whom you ask.</p>
<p>For local departments of public works, the mild season is a much-welcome way to save money, tackle road projects and log fewer overtime hours for employees. With no snow days, teachers and parents look forward to ending the school year on time; travelers enjoy on-time flights and few weather delays; and local fire departments get by without downed wires, ice-related car crashes and evacuations of flooded homes.</p>
<p>But for others, such as contract snowplow operators, the sunshine and rain means there&rsquo;s little for them to do. Hardware stores rely on sales of snowblowers, shovels and ice melt to get them through an otherwise-slow season; supermarkets miss out on panicked shopping trips; ski resorts are forced to make their own powder; and distributors are left with mounds of industrial salt, sand and ice melt that will go unused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years like this, people like us are the winners,&rdquo; Larry Prendeville, Quincy&rsquo;s public works superintendent, said. &ldquo;But other years, we lose out big time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a recent morning at the Quincy DPW lot, all was calm. Massive piles of salt and sand sat untouched, a dozen plow-ready trucks were left lining the parking lot, and street sweepers — equipment usually reserved for use between April and October — were out on local roads.</p>
<p>Of the $2.7 million budgeted for snow and ice removal this year, Quincy has spent about $1.7 million, Public Works Commissioner Al Grazioso said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of the year you still have to buy salt, you still have to buy equipment and plow blades. It&rsquo;s a big upfront cost no matter what happens,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we then save on contractors, overtime pay and materials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quincy usually uses about 17,000 tons of road salt in an average winter, Prendeville said, but only about 5,000 has been used this year.</p>
<p>Other communities have reported massive snow savings as well. In Plymouth, where about $1 million is spent annually, only $430,000 has come out of the budget. In Scituate, more than half of the $497,113 budget sits unused. Phil Lemnios, the Hull town manager, said the town usually spends about $250,000, but has only used $100,000 this year.</p>
<p>In most communities, snow and ice budgets are set low and allowed to be spent into a deficit. In the rare case that money is left over, it goes back into the community&rsquo;s general fund.</p>
<p>Grazioso and Prendeville said Quincy has been able to spend the winter completing projects that usually have to wait until the spring and summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re not plowing, they&rsquo;re doing something else,&rdquo; Prendeville said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be out doing potholes, sidewalks, emergency repairs. Things we may not be able to do in most winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For local school districts, the lack of snow brought similar bonuses. In Marshfield, an autumn windstorm and a mild storm in December brought the district&rsquo;s only days off, and less spending on snow removal and heating costs means money is available for other programs and upgrades in the schools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a win for students and teachers; no interruptions to their learning is great,&rdquo; Marshfield School Superintendent Jeff Granatino said. &ldquo;Snow days slow down the momentum of what&rsquo;s going on in the classroom, and it&rsquo;s tough for students to be in school, out of school, in, then back out. The parents are also winners because they didn’t have to try to arrange last-minute child care or use a vacation day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last school year also had only two inclement weather days, but the four years before had between three and eight days each. While Granatino thinks the students are winners in the situation, he knows some of them disagree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students are always eager to have a day here and there. I get it. I remember the feeling of excitement when you get to stay home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And (high school) seniors are always excited for them, too, because they know their graduation date is set, snow days or not. They’ll give me little gentle reminders when they think I should call a day, but luckily I haven’t had to make any tough calls this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students aren&rsquo;t the only ones who would have preferred a colder winter.</p>
<p>At Curry Ace Hardware in Quincy, managers are desperate to move winter-related items that have sat unsold for months. Snow shovels are buy-one-get-one-free, and snowblowers, which can retail for thousands of dollars, are being sold at major discounts. Some even come with a free gift card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All it takes is one New England snowstorm to move 500 shovels, so we have to stock them, but now I have 500 shovels to deal with,&rdquo; manager Rick Manupelli said. &ldquo;We just need to sell the product and get it out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the front of the store, a huge space sits empty where Manupelli has already started to move bags of ice melt into storage. Next to it, shelves of vegetable seeds are set up early and gloves and snow brushes have already been pulled from the shelves.</p>
<p>Manupelli said the lack of sales on winter goods has the store&rsquo;s profits down about 15 percent over the last several months, and he said even a major storm wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to salvage the season. McCasland, from the observatory, says he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The April Fool&rsquo;s storm of 1997 got about a foot of snow, but even that was gone within a week,&rdquo; McCasland said. &ldquo;If we got 2 or 3 inches at this point, it would be gone in a matter of hours. Because the warmer-than-average winter has warmed the ground, the snow accumulates slower than usual at this time of year and melts faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;ll get spring ready,&rdquo; Manupelli added. &ldquo;Nothing else we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Local landscaping companies are also excitedly waiting for spring, desperate to get jobs going after plow season forgot to show up.</p>
<p>Mike Lesher, owner of Hingham-based Landscaping by J. Michael, said this year&rsquo;s snowfall of about 15 inches is just one-quarter of what he usually sees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do depend on the snow for revenue and for keeping people employed,&rdquo; Lesher said. &ldquo;It caused us to have some unexpected reductions in hours for people that we really hoped to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lesher said it&rsquo;s possible to get work like brush clearing or patio building done during low-snow winters, but people have to be willing to get over the &ldquo;mental block&rdquo; that says yard work is reserved for spring and summer. He said his company is already putting together a contingency plan for next year, in hopes of being more prepared if few flurries fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silver lining of having a down winter like this is that we’ve gotten more calls at the beginning of March for people interested in projects than ever, and it’s allowed us to bid other projects,&rdquo; Lesher said. &ldquo;If we had a busy winter, I wouldn’t even have time to consider municipal bids. But this year I can, so we’ll be a lot more prepared for the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get by&rdquo; mentality was is a common one among snow-dependent businesses, including Blue Hills Ski Area in Canton. The small ski hill was forced to close for multiple days this winter because, despite costly and usually reliable snowmaking machines, it&rsquo;s just not possible to fake winter when temperatures get too high.</p>
<p>“Mother Nature has never been reliable, and you never know what you’re going to get, especially in New England,” Molly Ross, general manager of Blue Hills, told The Patriot Ledger in February.</p>
<p>March 19 will mark the astronomical first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, the earliest spring arrival in more than a century.</p>
