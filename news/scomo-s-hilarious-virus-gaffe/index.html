<p>The world can seem like a dark place at the moment so it&rsquo;s no surprise Australians were happy to latch onto one of the lighter parts of Scott Morrison&rsquo;s press conference last night.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison addressed the media late yesterday to announce further social distancing measures would need to be taken to fight the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>However a lighter moment came when the Prime Minister struggled to pronounce and clearly had no idea what barre was, despite the type of exercise being part of the new restrictions.</p>
<p>The fresh measures include the shuttering of beauty salons and strict limits on the amount of people who can attend weddings and funerals, as well as further indoor group exercise activities that are now not allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Community and recreation centres, health clubs, fitness centres, yoga, barre - I hope I pronounced that correctly,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might need some help with that, I&rsquo;m not quite sure what that is to be honest - but B-A-R-R-E, for those looking for the specific definition, and spin facilities, saunas, bath houses, wellness centres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact that Mr Morrison clearly had no idea what barre, a ballet-inspired pilates exercise, was and even pronounced it wrong (he said bar-re, rather than the one syllable barre) was soon seized on by viewers.</p>

<p>Who would have thought this would be barre&rsquo;s big moment? ‚Äî Dani Bevins (@DaniKBevins) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>Meanwhile, others admitted that, like Mr Morrison, they had no idea what barre was either.</p>
<p>Data from Google shows that searches for the term &ldquo;barre&rdquo; surged exponentially at the same time as Mr Morrison&rsquo;s press conference, meaning that a lot of us also had no idea what the exercise was.</p>
<p>I have found something I have in common with the PM&hellip;.I don‚Äôt know what barre is either ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Äî Peter van Onselen (@vanOnselenP) March 24, 2020</p>

<p>WHAT IS BARRE?</p>
<p>Barre is a full body workout inspired by elements of pilates, ballet and yoga which works small muscles one at a time through low-impact, high intensity movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The muscles in each group are fatigued via small targeted movements, high repetition, and light weight or resistance,&rdquo; barre trainer Katelyn DiGiorgio told Women&rsquo;s Health UK last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sections of class are also paired with stretching to increase overall flexibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While surging in popularity in the last five years, barre has been around for decades and was created by UK ballerina Lotte Berk in 1959.</p>

<p>For the curious! Barre fitness is a hybrid workout class - combining ballet-inspired moves with elements of Pilates, dance, yoga &amp; strength training. Most classes incorporate a ballet barre and use classic dance moves such as plies, alongside static stretches. #Covid_19australia ‚Äî üíßRob Stephenson FRSA (@RobBendigo) March 24, 2020

<h3 id="stop-with-the-confusing-rules-prime-minister-and-just-lock-us-down">Stop With The Confusing Rules, Prime Minister, And Just Lock Us Down</h3>
<p><img src="https://10daily.com.au/ip/s3/2020/03/24/4e4234bf47afde9ca1f6a07ffc6795ae-918894.jpg?image-profile=card_max&amp;io=landscape" alt="img">
A lockdown should be straightforward.</p>
<p>Last night‚Äôs announcement by Prime Minister Scott Morrison of even tougher social restrictions to tackle the coronavirus was anything but.</p>
<p>That press conference was the PM‚Äôs big chance to finally make clear Australia‚Äôs response to the virus sweeping the country. The number of cases here is currently doubling every three and a half days, about the same rate as overseas hotspots like Spain and New York. So when it comes to action, every moment counts.</p>
<p>Coronavirus READ MORE Scott Morrison Extends Lockdown To Food Courts, Weddings, Funerals And More &ldquo;These are not things we can do now&rdquo;, the Prime Minister declared on Tuesday night when he told the country the lockdown will apply to overseas travel, weddings, funerals, and much more from midnight Wednesday.</p>
<p>Instead, much of the televised event consisted of a lengthy, confusing and often seemingly contradictory list of things we should and shouldn‚Äôt be doing. Australians should have been left with a clear sense of where we stood (as far away from each other as possible), not making jokes about rushed haircuts involving 1.5-metre-long scissors.</p>
<p>We needed a simple, clear-cut message about the importance of shutting businesses and commercial spaces down to prevent the spread of a dangerous virus. Instead, the Prime Minister kept reeling off exceptions. Social distancing is vital, but we can still get a haircut so long as it takes less than 30 minutes? Schools are still open in NSW but it‚Äôs okay if parents keep their kids at home?</p>
<p>On the night there were just too many exceptions to what should have been a blunt message. Was this really the time to tell us that weddings can still take place (but only with a celebrant and witnesses), while funerals are allowed a maximum of 10 mourners? And that social gatherings are banned, unless they‚Äôre small groups at home? At least you can still have your mates over to watch the footy‚Ä¶ oh wait.</p>
<p>The early announcement that shopping centres would close was a strong statement that firm action was being taken. Then the Prime Minister clarified that only the food courts would be closing. But they could still do take away food for you, you just couldn‚Äôt sit down and eat it at the food court. At least we were spared finding out exactly how far away you have to walk before you can eat your dim sims.</p>
<p>Politics READ MORE The Full List Of New Things Banned In Australia Under Coronavirus Rules Big BBQs and parties banned, restrictions on tattoo parlours and waxing, haircuts limited to 30 minutes, and more wedding and funeral rules are just some of the new regulations you&rsquo;ll be living under in Australia.</p>
<p>Yes, some points needed clarifying after Sunday night‚Äôs muddled message to the nation. But being told that the current definition of an essential job that requires you to go into work is that &lsquo;if you have a job, it is considered essential&rsquo; doesn‚Äôt make anything clearer.</p>
<p>If you saw the recent images of a crowded Bondi Beach, you know there are a lot of people who aren‚Äôt taking the whole &lsquo;deadly virus that will overwhelm our health service unless we take major action now&rsquo; thing seriously. The Prime Minister‚Äôs message was aimed directly at them, not those already staying home and staying isolated. Problem is, they‚Äôre exactly the people looking for a loophole to allow them to keep on doing what they‚Äôre doing. And the Prime Minister gave them plenty to work with.</p>
<p>Telling people that it‚Äôs still okay to go out is technically correct. Many will still have to leave home for food and other essential items. But that‚Äôs not the part of the message that needs to be stressed at this point. The problem isn‚Äôt that people are scared to go out; at this stage, people should be scared. It‚Äôs that there are still people who aren‚Äôt staying at home.</p>
<p>For them, any qualification on the message not to go out just tells them that they don‚Äôt really have to stay at home. When the Prime Minister says ‚Äúwe want Australians to exercise their common sense‚Äù about gatherings, he‚Äôs relying on something not everyone seems to have.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not a matter of letting those stupid enough to congregate on a crowded beach go ahead and make each other sick. Viruses don‚Äôt work that way. Letting people choose whether they go out or stay in means the virus keeps spreading until everyone gets it. There‚Äôs no choice between your right to hang out with your mates and someone else‚Äôs right to live &ndash; and as the reports from overseas are making extremely clear, this virus is killing people young and old alike.</p>
<p>What we needed the Prime Minister to say was that first and foremost, Australia was going into lockdown. Yes, there would be exceptions. But the lockdown part is what we need to hear. This isn‚Äôt business as usual and life is not going on as normal.</p>
<p>You think it‚Äôs worth risking your life and the lives of others for a half-hour hair appointment? Cut it out.

<p><img src="https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2020/03/26/andrew-probyn-scomo.png" alt="img">
The time, Sunday night. The location, a press conference. Temperatures, high. Enter Scott Morrison and ABC journo Andrew Probyn.</p>
<p>ScoMo briefly told Probyn off, after he attempted to ask another question. The following dialogue was spoken: ‚ÄúAndrew, I‚Äôm sorry, you‚Äôve have several‚Ä¶ Andrew, I‚Äôm sorry, Andrew, I know, but you don‚Äôt run the press conference, okay? So, I‚Äôm going to go to other questions of members of the group. Katherine hasn‚Äôt had a question. I‚Äôm happy to return to you, but let‚Äôs just keep things civil.‚Äù</p>
<p>Here is Scott Morrison telling Andrew Probyn to stop asking questions#COVID19Aus #Covid_19australia pic.twitter.com/zZEolLV89R ‚Äî corbpie (@corbpie) March 22, 2020</p>
<p>And voil√† ‚Äì just like that, an iconic moment was born. Lights, camera, ACTION!</p>
<p>Heroic young Aussies began to imitate ScoMo‚Äôs scolding, because that‚Äôs what we like to do and that‚Äôs how process things.</p>
<p>This ScoMo/journo showdown was subsequently catapulted into virality.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, these quarantined legends truly lip-synced for their lives.</p>
<p>True Oscar-worthy performances. Shantay, you all stay.</p>
<p>@Sooklyn has since began dedicating her time to performing a whole heap of ScoMo‚Äôs painful press conferences. She is truly doing the lord‚Äôs work ‚Äì battling on the frontlines ‚Äì and, for that, we simply have no choice but to stan.</p>
<p>Art imitates life, and, in this particular case, amplifies the absurdity of our government right now.
