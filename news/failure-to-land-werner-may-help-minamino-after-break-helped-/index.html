<p>Takumi Minamino used Liverpool’s 102-day break from competitive action wisely.</p>
<p>The Japan international spent a lot of his spare time during the lockdown improving his grasp of the English language so he could communicate better with club staff and team-mates.</p>
<p>He has also been immersing himself in the culture of his new home city, listening to the music of The Beatles after his walks along the iconic waterfront brought him to the statues of the Fab Four.</p>
<p>Food parcels from Liverpool’s head of nutrition, Mona Nemmer, proved to be a godsend, especially after his favourite Japanese restaurant Etsu, a short walk from his city-centre apartment, was forced to shut its doors. His girlfriend Yurina Yanagi, an actress and model, divides her time between Europe and their homeland.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been an easy introduction to English football for Minamino following his £7.25 million move from RB Salzburg in January. He had played a total of just&hellip;

<p>Good morning, and welcome to the end.</p>
<p>Derby day now represents something paradoxical to its usual stomach-churning, local strong-arming nausea. Gone are the scoffs at sirens, the illogical fear of Dominic Calvert-Lewin when you have the best team in the world or the them, them; anyone but them which engulfs you.</p>
<p>Instead there is void and unknown. We&rsquo;re still the best football team in the land, and that may well come to the fore. But this is now the beginning of ending the longest wait. The most elongated of solstice: 106 days, 29 Premier League matches of predominant domination and 30 years of domestic perplexity.</p>
<p>And all the time, there is means to another hugely significant end which we haven&rsquo;t considered. By our mere species we measure time linearly — forward. In a football vortex we&rsquo;re back doing so. However, spare a minute of your Sunday morning serenity to consider what has happened since lockdown began. Particularly with how you view your club and this game.</p>
<p>For the first time in our football (and perhaps non-football) lives we&rsquo;ve had the chance for reflection and self-assessment. Here at liverpool.com myself, Ollie, Joel and Kris have all gone through this journey while doing this job. We have been able to look back, absorb and educate ourselves on the sheer heavyweight nature of Liverpool Football Club and its history in a way time previously never allowed. That has manifested in pieces from Mark Gonzales to Mo Salah - Maribor to Madrid. Regardless, we have strived to give you something a bit different.</p>
<p>And so to today. This point represents an end of something which will take everyone time to absorb and reflect on, and still it isn&rsquo;t over. But it&rsquo;s the beginning of watching the team we love again. What version we see is far from formalised. Liverpool have kept quiet on the injury concerns of Salah and Andy Robertson. In this case, no news is usually&hellip; bad news. The Reds could still have enough for this Everton team regardless, and there is now the opportunity for a fresh page in the chapters of certain players. In particular, someone like Takumi Minamino if the Egyptian doesn&rsquo;t make it today. Therefore, I&rsquo;m going for:</p>
<p>Predicted Liverpool lineup vs Everton: Alisson, Robertson, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Gomez, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Minamino, Firmino, Mane</p>
<p>Subs: Adrian, Matip, Milner, Fabinho, Lovren, Origi, Keita, Lallana, Jones</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m reading on Liverpool.com: There is a really good read from Joel on the site about Joe Gomez and his future legacy. The contrast of him now being in Van Dijk&rsquo;s shadow, but how that may benefit him going forward. Also, this tactical spot from Ollie on the flaws of Everton&rsquo;s midfield and where it can be exploited is one to look out for later.

<h3 id="klopp-explains-how-minamino-has-changed-ahead-of-liverpool-return">&ldquo;Klopp explains how Minamino has changed ahead of Liverpool return&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2020/01/31132925/minamino2-1.jpg" alt="img">
Jurgen Klopp insists that Takumi Minamino will return to action as a completely different player thanks to four weeks of work with Liverpool in training.</p>
<p>Liverpool signed Minamino in January for just over £7m, after he impressed against them for RB Salzburg in the Champions League. However, the midfielder has found it tough to adapt to the Premier League so far.</p>
<p>The Japanese international is yet to start a Premier League game, managing just 77 minutes from the bench so far. He added three appearances in the FA Cup, but that was a competition in which Klopp mainly used youngsters and rotation players.</p>
<p>Teammates have cited issues with understanding the Scouse accent as one of the reasons Minamino has struggled with the transition.</p>
<p>However, the Liverpool boss thinks that was perfectly normal, for any new player. And after scoring in a training game against Blackburn last week, Klopp is confident Minamino has used the break to good effect and has fully settled in now.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, massively so,” Klopp told LiverpoolFC.com when asked how Minamino had benefitted from the extended break, and subsequent return to training.</p>
<p>“Look, a new player is coming in and usually, how it is with us especially, you say, ‘Come on, the first two, three, four months you don’t really judge’. We don’t, but I know the public does and that means then we always have to explain why it’s not like this [and] why it’s not like that and all these things.</p>
<p>“And the more time you have, for whatever reason, the better it is and now we had four weeks [since Liverpool returned to training] – which is, by the way, the longest pre-season I ever had with any Liverpool side together. We were all together over that period and that’s a massive difference.</p>
<p>“Usually we have all together only one [week], or I think last year it was not even a week when Sadio [Mane] came back, for example.”</p>
<p>Academy prospects also benefit, says Klopp</p>
<p>Klopp also explained that the extended time back in training has allowed him to integrate some of his most promising academy players.</p>
<p>The likes of Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott have already made their first team debuts, and Klopp clearly has an eye on the future – confirming he has been able to call up more players from their academy squad.</p>
<p>“Yes, it helped. It helped him [Minamino], it helped the young kids a lot. Neco [Williams], Curtis, Harvey, it helped them really [and] brought even more young kids up – Jake Cain and Leighton Clarkson, that’s so nice to see them and how much they get the benefit from the way we train and the way the other players treat them.</p>
<p>“So yes it helped and Taki, 100 per cent. He looks really different in the moment to the first three weeks when he tried to please everybody and do everything that we say, and that’s in a language he is not 100 per cent comfortable with.</p>
<p>“That’s how it is so now we had much more time, he had much more time to settle and he settled. That’s good and yeah, that helped.”

<h3 id="minamino-would-be-best-in-firminos-position---marsch-believes-japan-international-can-thrive-at-liverpool">&ldquo;&lsquo;Minamino would be best in Firmino&rsquo;s position&rsquo; - Marsch believes Japan international can thrive at Liverpool&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;Minamino would be best in Firmino&rsquo;s position&rsquo; - Marsch believes Japan international can thrive at Liverpool</p>
<p>The American coach believes the Reds received a bargain in the talented forward and tipped him for big things at Anfield</p>
<p>Jesse Marsch believes that his former charge Takumi Minamino has what it takes to thrive at , suggesting the Japanese star would fit best in Roberto Firmino&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>Minamino joined Liverpool from Red Bull Salzburg in January in a £7.25 million ($9m) deal, making six total appearances for the Reds before football was shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Marsch helped develop the 25-year-old in , watching the versatile international score nine goals for his side this season before departing for .</p>
<p>Finding playing time at Anfield will be a challenge for Minamino, who will have to compete with the likes of Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Firmino in attack.</p>
<p>Marsch has said that Minamino would best fit in Firmino&rsquo;s role, playing in a more withdrawn position and creating chances for his team-mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won’t be the best at playing the position that Salah and Sadio play, because they are used in very explosive transition movements,&rdquo; the American told the Blood Red podcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he could be good in Roberto Firmino’s position where against the ball, he is ready to do some pressing, but then with the ball, he comes into almost a 10 position for build-up and gets in the box to score goals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firmino is so good at it but I think that’s something Taki can do as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think he can play the eight position that they play in the midfield, with the two wide spots where he’s ready to press and help pick up balls, but he’s also part of the build-up phases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liverpool scouted Minamino for months before activating his release clause, and Marsch admits that the relatively small amount the Reds paid for his services rankled with the Austrian club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that hurt with Taki is that Liverpool got him way, way, way too cheap. But this is part of managing the market and managing player contracts,&rdquo; Marsch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always have here, with the scouting team and the sports director, they do an amazing job, and we always have the next generation of players here and ready to take the next step.&rdquo;

Liverpool veteran James Milner is convinced Takumi Minamino will be a Premier League star.</p>
<p>The January arrival from RB Salzburg has had a slow start to his Reds career.</p>
<p>But Milner told Goal: &ldquo;Taki has looked fantastic. This period may have helped him to adapt, to feel that he has been in the club longer than he has, really. It has given him that extra time to get used to things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to get into the middle of the season, to get used to how a team plays. It is difficult to do that when preparing for a match every three days. I am sure this period has helped him and hopefully he can have a positive impact.&rdquo;

<p>Roberto Firmino has been described as irreplaceable at Liverpool, the man the Reds can find no other player in world football to replicate. To compensate for no Firmino, the perception is that Jürgen Klopp has to change the shape of his side and buy one or possibly two forwards, which is now as we know, unlikely. The irony remains that replacing Sadio Mané may prove to be much more riddlesome in time, especially as it seems the answer to the Firmino riddle has already in theory been solved.</p>
<p>When Liverpool bought Takumi Minamino from Red Bull Salzburg at a ridiculously low price in January, his debut against Everton in the FA Cup the following week was eagerly anticipated. Getting another glimpse of the Japanese star in red was one reason why, but seeing where he lined up in Klopp&rsquo;s makeshift XI was much more intruguing.</p>
<p>It was and is clear Klopp sees Minamino as a central figure in the sense of the spaces and positions he occupies. Similar to Firmino, he loves the pockets of space between the number eight and forward positions. Minamino can tackle, screen track and intercept as a mid-line to forward option in all the ways Firmino can. But playing them together is proving troublesome.</p>
<p>When Minamino was named in the team against Everton yesterday, many expected a different formation, with 4-2-3-1 and 4-2-2-2 mooted. Nobody seemed to envisage the Mohamed Salah impression Minamino gave for 45 minutes, which inevitably brought its own problems. The number 18 was at times out of position and line, while also not dropping in centrally with Mane when Firmino picked the ball up deep.</p>
<p>This is a key feature of Liverpool&rsquo;s play with the front-three, being that Salah and Mané end up as a central strike pair, with Firmino playing at what looks like the tip of a diamond. Yet Minamino constantly seems to be checking where he is on the pitch for fear he is invading space, rather than creating it.</p>
<p>Minamino received the ball 19 times at Goodison Park, with as many (five) passes received in the middle third as the attacking third. He was found mostly by Trent Alexander-Arnold (five passes) and then by Firmino (three), most of which were in what you would class as &ldquo;Firmino areas&rdquo; of the pitch.</p>
<p>The Brazilian meanwhile, received the ball 24 times, six from Mane and six from Naby Keita. Oddly, many were on Mane&rsquo;s left flank, which indicates Firmino may have been gravitating away from Minamino to find other pockets of space.</p>
<p>This is by no means an attempt to criticise or sabotage the Japanese forward, but it does highlight some of the on-going teething issues Liverpool are having as they try to blood him into their forward line. Minamino is yet to start a game with Mane and Salah, and therefore any kind of judgement should wait until he&rsquo;s been afforded such a luxury more often. It increasingly seems that only one of Minamino and Firmino works on the pitch together, but the opportunities will undoubtedly continue for both until the end of the season.

If you&rsquo;re not a fan of Minamino already: &ldquo;In January 2014, Minamino held the Guinness World Records for high fives in a minute whilst running at the Komagawa Shopping Street with an achievement of 187 times, making the world’s new record&rdquo;
