What could a stage three coronavirus lockdown look like for Australia?</p>
<p>Updated</p>
<p>Australians could face a stage three shutdown if the coronavirus pandemic gets worse.</p>
<p>Key points: Public health expert says stage three shutdown would send a clear message</p>
<p>If Australia follows the UK&rsquo;s lead, retail shops could soon close</p>
<p>International examples show newsagents, vets and hardware shops are essential businesses</p>
<p>This week Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced stage two of the government&rsquo;s scalable shutdown measures to curb social gatherings.</p>
<p>So, what could a stage three shutdown would look like for Australia?</p>
<p>Retailers could close</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s stage three shutdown would likely mirror the UK, where tougher restrictions were put in place to stop community transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a coronavirus lockdown for at least three weeks.</p>
<p>All shops selling non-essential goods have been shut, schools closed and gatherings of more than two people banned.</p>
<p>Just like in Australia, libraries, gyms, places of worship, and children&rsquo;s playgrounds were also closed.</p>
<p>Hairdressing salons and most beauty service providers were closed.</p>

<p>Online retail was still open and encouraged and the postal service was running as normal.</p>
<p>What would remain open?</p>
<p>While non-essential retail would likely be closed in Australia under a stage three shutdown scenario, there were many businesses in the UK still trading.</p>
<p>If Australia followed their example, people would still be able to visit:</p>
<p>Corner shops and newsagents</p>
<p>Vet surgeries</p>
<p>Agricultural supply shops</p>
<p>Dry cleaners</p>
<p>Hardware shops</p>
<p>Petrol stations, grocery stores, banks and pharmacies would also remain open.</p>
<p>What about tradies?</p>
<p>Under a stage three shutdown, it&rsquo;s likely tradespeople could still operate in people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p>In the UK, work carried out in private homes was still permitted provided that the tradesperson was well and had no symptoms.</p>
<p>No work was allowed in any household where a person was self-isolating.</p>
<p>New Zealand in lockdown</p>
<p>In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern already locked down her country in a bid to eradicate the virus.</p>
<p>Under tough stage four restrictions introduced on Wednesday, all businesses in New Zealand were closed except for essential services and lifeline utilities.</p>
<p>Essential services were deemed to be supermarkets, pharmacies and GP clinics.</p>
<p>Non-essential businesses and workers were still able to work as long as they did it from home.</p>
<p>Residents have been instructed to only make physical contact with those they lived with and while exercising is being encouraged, it&rsquo;s recommended as a solitary activity.</p>
<p>What the experts say</p>
<p>Public health expert Gerard Fitzgerald from the Queensland University of Technology said if Australia moved to a stage three shutdown it would send a clear message to Australians to stay home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closing down non-essential shops and services won&rsquo;t necessarily provide us with greater protection against the virus but it will help reiterate the message about social distancing,&rdquo; Dr Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, economics professor Dr Ross Guest from Griffith University said businesses should not be closed unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>He said the government needed to balance the cost of the pandemic to public health and the economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the cost of closing all non-essential services stacks up,&rdquo; Dr Guest said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we are doing is crushing hundreds of thousands of small business people and crushing their lives, crushing their families for many year to come.&rdquo;</p>

Thousands of Australians caught up in India’s sweeping lockdown are pleading for government help to get home</p>
<p>Thousands of Australians caught by India’s dramatic nationwide shutdown say they face running out of food and water or being evicted from accommodation, as 1.3 billion people across world’s second-most populous nation are ordered to stay indoors.</p>
<p>One state leader, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, warned if the lockdown was not obeyed, he would order police to shoot-on-sight those who went outside.</p>
<p>Thousands of Australian tourists, expatriate workers and “overseas citizens of India” have been stranded by India’s dramatic shutdown, the largest lockdown the world has seen to arrest the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“There will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes … forget what going out means,” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi told the nation.</p>
<p>Overcome by anxiety: Indians in lockdown many can ill afford Read more</p>
<p>There are no commercial flights permitted in or out of India until at least 15 April, and Australians fear they will not be able to get home without a government-sponsored repatriation flight, which are being allowed by India’s government.</p>
<p>Australian Jai Houltham is stranded in Goa on India’s west coast. He has been moved on from two hotels that were closed down by police and fears he may be forced out again, with nowhere left to go.</p>
<p>“We are now at the end of the fifth day of a total lockdown, police roam the streets with lathis [bamboo poles used to enforce crowd control], ensuring everyone stays inside, many unable to get supplies,” Houltham said.</p>
<p>“The lockdown has been extended to the 14th of April, and there is talk of it being extended for three months, with currently no option for Australians to get home.”</p>
<p>Houltham said many tourists had tried to get back to Australia when the government first called for citizens to return, but had faced unannounced flight cancellations, sudden border closures or restrictions on transiting through international airports.</p>
<p>“Now with complete lockdown, accommodation closing and people being left on the streets, and being unable to access food, water or medicines, people have had enough and are desperate for the Australian government to step in.”</p>
<p>The lockdown will impact harshly upon millions of Indian citizens. The country has a relatively low number of Covid-19 cases, with 722 infections and 16 deaths so far. But most states have recorded cases, and there are suspicions the number of infections is incorrect because testing is not widespread.</p>
<p>The government is desperate to avoid community transmission in a massive country where tens of millions live in densely populated communities with poor sanitation and limited healthcare access. India has only one isolation bed per 84,000 people and the whole country has only 40,000 ventilators for acute cases.</p>
<p>But the lockdown, too, will be especially difficult for the tens of millions of Indians who rely on daily wagework – from rickshaw driving to construction to food vending – to survive.</p>
<p>Houltham said many Australians stranded in India were starting to run out of money, particular with rising accommodation and food costs.</p>

<p>“The Indian government has said it would allow government assisted flights on commercial carriers to transport nationals back to their home country during the lockdown, and many countries including the UK, Germany, France and Russia are in the process of doing so.”</p>
<p>Australia’s High Commission in New Delhi has told citizens “we would encourage you all to stay indoors and avoid any crowded place. Please note there are no evacuation plans yet declared by the Australian government for Australians in India”.</p>
<p>“If your situation is, or becomes life-threatening, or you have serious concerns for your welfare (eg cannot find any accommodation whatsoever, or any food, or essential medications), please don’t hesitate to contact us,” consular officials have said.</p>
<p>Around the world, some flights back to Australia are being organised.</p>
<p>A commercial charter, organised by Chimu Adventures with Australian government assistance, will fly stranded Australians out of Peru, likely on Sunday. The over-subscribed flight will retrieve passengers from Cusco and Lima.</p>
<p>However, many Australians stuck in Peru could not afford the $5000 being asked for an economy class seat on the flight or missed out on booking, while others are in remote parts of the locked-down country where all internal movement has been banned, putting airports out of reach.</p>
<p>Another flight is bringing Australians home from Montevideo, collecting passengers from the Ocean Atlantic cruise ship, at port in that city, as well as other Australians in Uruguay.</p>
<p>Some Australians were able to leave Bolivia in recent days on commercial flights, Australia’s ambassador Diana Nelson said, as the country has further tightened its lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>Nelson said adults were only allowed to leave their accommodation once a week, and only to go shopping between 7am and midday.</p>

<p>The foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her department continues to plan for further repatriation flights all over the world, and is in talks with Qantas and Virgin about running “non-scheduled” flights to cities around the world from where stranded Australians are trying to get home.</p>
<p>“We do not have plans for assisted departures, such as those conducted to the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, Wuhan in China, and Japan.”</p>
<p>But the government has conceded many Australians could be stranded overseas for the duration of the global Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“It may be necessary for some Australians to stay where they are overseas … given the unprecedented scale of the global interruption to travel, the options outlined will not return all Australians travellers home.”</p>
