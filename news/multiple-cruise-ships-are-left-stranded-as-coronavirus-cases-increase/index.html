<p>(CNN) — Several cruise ships are stranded at sea, some with confirmed coronavirus cases on board, as the pandemic expands around the globe.</p>
<p>Some ships have been denied port, leaving them to anchor off the coast of a country. Other cruises have docked with quarantined passengers aboard.</p>
<p>Three cruise ships have confirmed cases of coronavirus on board: the MS Braemar, Silver Shadow and Silver Explorer.</p>
<p>Here is the status of the cruise ships in limbo that we know of.</p>
<p>MS Braemar</p>
<p>Status: Stranded in the Bahamas</p>

<p>A cruise ship with at least five confirmed coronavirus cases is frantically searching for a place to dock after it was refused several ports of entry in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Four passengers and one crew member aboard the MS Braemar tested positive for the virus, according to a statement from British company Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, which owns the Braemar.</p>

<p>Twenty passengers and another 20 crew members, including a doctor, are in isolation after displaying influenza-like symptoms while traveling on the ship, Fred Olsen Cruise Lines said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Braemar is anchored about 25 miles offshore in the Bahamas. It&rsquo;s waiting for clearance from the local government to bring aboard food, fuel and medication, as well as two doctors and two nurses who will help the ship&rsquo;s medical team.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is in discussions with authorities in Cuba and the US to find a suitable port for the Braemar, according to British government sources familiar with the efforts. Cuba is looking like the more likely option.</p>
<p>Silver Shadow</p>
<p>Status: Docked in Brazil, passengers in isolation</p>

<p>A Canadian passenger tested positive for coronavirus Saturday on the Silver Shadow, which is docked off the port of Recife in Brazil, according to Brazil&rsquo;s state news agency Agencia Brasil.</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean confirmed the case on the Silver Shadow on Sunday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two guests aboard the Silver Shadow have been medically disembarked in Recife, Brazil, and one has tested positive for COVID-19,&rdquo; Royal Caribbean said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s 609 passengers have been in isolation since Thursday when a passenger showed symptoms similar to coronavirus, Agencia Brasil said on Friday.</p>
<p>One of the passengers who disembarked, a 78-year-old man from Canada, had a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. He was sent to a private hospital in the city.</p>
<p>Silver Explorer</p>
<p>Status: Docked in Chile, one passenger tested positive</p>

<p>The Silver Explorer docked in Castro, Chile, on Saturday after a passenger tested positive for coronavirus, Chile&rsquo;s Health Minister Jaime Manalich said during a press conference in Santiago Saturday.</p>
<p>An 83-year-old British man is in &ldquo;good condition&rdquo; and being treated at the Coyhaique Hospital after testing positive, Manalich said. Royal Caribbean, which owns the Silver Explorer, confirmed the coronavirus case on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One guest aboard the Silver Explorer has been medically disembarked in Castro, Chile, also testing positive for the virus,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>
<p>The cruise ship is carrying 111 passengers and 120 crew members, according to Chilean officials.</p>
<p>Golden Princess</p>
<p>Status: Cleared to set sail for Australia</p>

<p>While no one has tested positive for coronavirus on the Golden Princess anchored off New Zealand, at least three passengers have been quarantined by the ship&rsquo;s doctor, according to local health officials.</p>
<p>One passenger developed symptoms similar to coronavirus and was being treated as a suspected case, according to the Canterbury District Health Board. Two other passengers had contact with a confirmed case in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>The ship is anchored in Akaroa Harbor near Christchurch so there could be &ldquo;precautionary health testing&rdquo; of guests who traveled on an international flight from Los Angeles, Princess Cruises said in a statement to CNN. The flight had a passenger who later tested positive for coronavirus in Australia. The cruise line said the airline passenger who tested positive has never been on board its ship.</p>
<p>The passenger with respiratory symptoms tested negative for coronavirus, Princess Cruises told CNN on Sunday. The Golden Princess was cleared to leave and set sail for Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have also apologized to guests that this means that the remainder of their New Zealand itinerary has been canceled,&rdquo; the cruise liner said in a statement to CNN.</p>
<p>Passengers have not been allowed to disembark the ship. The Golden Princess departed Melbourne on March 10 for a 13-day voyage, Princess Cruises said.</p>
<p>Norwegian Jewel</p>
<p>Status: Stranded in the South Pacific Ocean, no cases reported</p>

<p>The Norwegian Jewel is searching for a port in the Pacific Ocean after being denied permission to dock at two previously scheduled ports, Norwegian Cruise Line said.</p>
<p>The ship is at sea in the South Pacific Ocean off the coast of Suva, Fiji, as of Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The cruise was scheduled to disembark Sunday in Papeete, French Polynesia, but the port was canceled, the company said. Another scheduled port of Lautoka, Fiji, on March 17 was also canceled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are actively working to find an alternative port and are communicating with guests regularly as we have further information,&rdquo; the cruise line said in a statement.</p>
<p>CNN is not aware of any reports of coronavirus cases on board the Norwegian Jewel.</p>
<p>Cruises to disembark</p>
<p>The Celebrity Eclipse is anchored in San Antonio, Chile. Celebrity Cruises is working with government officials to provide a controlled disembarkation plan to make sure guests have a way to leave the country, a spokesperson said.
