SPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about the Season 4 finale of This Is Us.</p>
<p>When This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman was writing tonight’s Season 4 finale, no one from the show had any idea that it would air during a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of 19,000 people worldwide.</p>
<p>Yet, the show’s signature uplifting tone struck the right note in the finale, which provided some much needed optimism in dark times, from the welcome return of Dr. K, who reassured us that “Life does have a way of shaking out to be more beautiful than tragic” to the very last line of dialogue in the episode, “Hope, her name is Hope” uttered by grown-up Jack as his wife was cradling their newborn baby daughter.</p>
<p>That line brings us to the cavalcade of surprising twists served tonight, a This Is Us finale tradition. It was directed to a new character, Hailey, Jack’s Sister (Adelaide Kane), whom Kate and Toby decided to adopt on Jack’s first birthday earlier in the episode.</p>
<p>In another sibling twist, Kevin’s son whom we saw in last season’s finale flash-forward, also has a sister. They are twins, and their mother is Madison (Caitlin Thompson), who dropped the shocking news to Kevin that he was going to be a father (x 2) after their one-night stand. He took it well, assuring Madison that he is “all in” and acknowledging that his children may be the love his life.</p>
<p>Fogelman, who acknowledged that he felt “hesitant and a little worried” to talk about a TV show amid a health crisis, moved in to reassure any fans worried that Kevin has given up on love. “There are many more chapters in Kevin’s romantic story,” he said. Listing all the great love stories on the show, Jack &amp; Rebecca, Randall &amp; Beth, Toby &amp; Kate, Fogelman noted, “It felt like an interesting time to have a character to embark upon parenthood with a partner who is a virtual stranger to him.”</p>
<p>Featured for fleeting seconds toward the end of the finale were two women from Kevin’s romantic past, Sophie (Alexandra Breckenridge) and Cassidy (Jennifer Morrison). The way they were introduced into the finale was carefully thought out, Fogelman said.</p>
<p>“As Kevin is contemplating giving up on the idea of great love, and cutting to these women whom he had very intense relationships with, there is a reason for that,” he said. “These characters, we are not done with, whether or not it’s related to Kevin, I can’t say.” Fogelman also would not provide any clues about the identities of Kevin or Nicky’s future wives.</p>
<p>In addition to two Pearsons, Hailey and Kevin’s daughter, the finale introduced three other new characters, including Madison’s OBGYN Eli (Josh Hamilton) and his horse whisperer teenage daughter Sadie (Glory Rose). We will see more of Eli next season, and there was special context in the way he was introduced too.</p>
<p>“Josh is a favorite actor of mine,” Fogelman said. “The doctor becomes an important character next season to Kevin – he’s having twins with a virtual stranger, not a normal birth experience. It’s no coincidence he was introduced in the same episode that Dr K returned.“</p>
<p>We saw what triggered the fallout between Randall and Kevin, revealed in the Season 4 midseason finale flash-forward to the Big 3 40th birthday, which had Kevin and Kate celebrating sans Randal because, as Kevin reminded Rebecca, “We’re not speaking.”</p>
<p>Ron Batzdorff/NBC</p>
<p>In tonight’s finale, Kevin realized that it was Randall who made Rebecca change her mind about doing the clinical trial in St. Louis and went after him in an all-out verbal brawl, which ended with one of the most hurtful things one Big Three member has ever said to another. “Hand to god, Randall, the worst thing that ever happened to me is the day they brought you home,” Kevin said.</p>
<p>Fogelman revealed that the scene was difficult to write and to watch.</p>
<p>“It had to be something that would really separate these two for a period of time In this family,” he said, noting that Kevin and Randall had been estranged for a large part of their lives and had only gotten close over the past 2.5-3 seasons. “This is Cain and Abel type stuff between these two; this is a fight that goes back to literally their inception, through them, as alpha males, growing up during exactly the same period of time, both with widely different skillsets.”</p>
<p>Ron Batzdorff/NBC</p>
<p>While exiled from the rest of the Peterson clan, Randall will hold incredibly tight to his immediate family who will rally around him, Fogelman said.</p>
<p>As bad as the falling-out was, the good news is that the brothers eventually will repair the rift. Tonight we saw the continuation of the flash-forward scene in the Season 3 finale. To recap: last year, we saw Toby (with no wedding ring) coming to Kevin’s house for some sort of family gathering, saying of Jack that “they are on their way,” which could be referring to Hailey, Kate or both. (Fogelman would not say who.) We also saw Kevin’s son before Randal went up to a room where Rebecca was lying in a hospital bed with Nicky by her side.</p>
<p>Tonight, we saw Kevin join Rebecca and the two men for a touching moment of brotherly love between him and Randall, as well as both of Kevin’s twins. But we are yet to find out: what is Nicky doing by Rebecca’s bedside, why is Miguel MIA and most importantly, where is Kate?</p>
<p>Fogelman declined to reveal when we will get answers. “I can’t tell you if it happens next season or the season after, but definitely the answers will come by the end of the series,” he said.</p>
<p>As to when the end of the series is, Fogelman indicated that the plan remains for This Is Us to wrap its run with Season 6. “That’s when the Pearson story will basically come to a close,” he said.</p>
<p>Until then, the series may introduce new future time periods as it starts to rely more on flash-forwards and a little less less on flashbacks. “The series will be tilting into different timelines that go past present time a little bit more as we move forward,” Fogelman said. “More of that is coming, and not just in that deep deep future.”</p>
<p>He hinted that there may be a big flash forward-related reveal in the Season 5 premiere, which he already has written.</p>
<p>Next season will be about birth and rebirth as a main theme. “I’m very excited, especially with where the world is right now, about the uplift and rebirth, as I call it, that come next season,” Fogelman said.</p>
<p>Parallel to that, “It’s going to be a challenging chapter for Rebecca moving forward,” he said. “We have a big story arc planned for Mandy (Moore) next season as an older woman with Alzheimers in present time and a past timeline.”

<h3 id="this-is-us-did-sterling-k-brown-just-drop-a-gigantic-clue-about-season-5">‘This Is Us’: Did Sterling K. Brown Just Drop a Gigantic Clue About Season 5?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sterling-K.-Brown-Justin-Hartley-and-Chrissy-Metz.jpg" alt="img">
The season finale of This Is Us aired just last night and already fans are wondering what’s next for season 5. While the season 4 finale answered a lot of fans’ burning questions, it also left room for a ton more theories and speculations. One of the most devastating theories involves the future of Kate Pearson. But, nothing sparked as many questions or theories as Sterling K. Brown did with a recent Instagram post.</p>
<p>[Spoiler Alert: This article contains spoilers for the This Is Us season finale.]</p>

<p>Sterling K. Brown’s cryptic Instagram post</p>
<p>Earlier today, on March 25, 2020, Brown took to his Instagram page to post a video with one of the younger members of the This Is Us cast. Though we don’t know the name of the character just yet, it is Kevin’s daughter. Brown joked that the young actress was trying to teach him the popular dance, The Renegade. “The renegade is still around in the year 2045. Kevin’s kid just taught me. How’d I do?😂 #ThisIsUs” Brown joked.</p>
<p>While some people were quick to comment on Brown’s dancing skills (including his This Is Us castmates) others were more concerned about the year that Brown referenced. As 2045 is 20 years in the future and Kevin’s kids looked to be around 12 to 13 in the flash-forwards, the timeline seems to be off. “Wait! 2045? Kevin’s kids aren’t 25. More like 2030,” one fan wrote. “Wait…if she’s one of the twins, wouldn’t this be the 2030 timeline? SKB, ARE YOU TRYING TO THROW US OFF THE TRAIL?! ❤️” another fan chimed in.</p>
<p>Fans are confused by the timeline</p>
<p>But while some people feel that Brown simply said the wrong year, others feel that this timeline makes more sense. Randall, Rebecca, and Kevin all seemed to have aged more than 12-13 years in the flash-forward. A 20-year timeline, on the other hand, could allow for a lot more possibilities. First and foremost, it could allow for more time for Randall and Kevin to truly mend the rift between themselves. But, it could also mean that Kevin gets his happily ever after with Sophie.</p>
<p>Is Kevin engaged to Madison or Sophie?</p>
<p>During the season four finale of This Is Us, it is revealed that Madison is pregnant by Kevin with not just one baby, but two. After some reflection, Kevin decides that he’s done chasing ghosts and that he is all in with Madison. While some fans are convinced this means the couple will eventually fall in love, others aren’t so sure. Some people think that while Kevin will be a great father to Madison’s twins, romantically he’ll go back to Sophie and have another set of children.</p>
<p>Does Kevin have two sets of twins?</p>
<p>“My theory is those are not Madison’s twins or maybe not even twins at all, they could just be siblings. I think that Rebecca, Kevin, and Randal all look as though they have aged at least 20 years there which would make Madison’s children adults,” one This is Us fan wrote on Instagram. “Was thinking the same thing! He ends up marrying Sophie and has twins with her as well,” another person chimed in.</p>
<p>Other fans have similar theories, but they’re a bit more complex and sad. Some diehard This Is Us supporters believe that Madison will die in childbirth leaving Kevin to raise his twins with Sophie. Others feel that Madison will suffer a miscarriage similar to Rebecca. “So after thinking about it again. I think the boy and girl are Sophie’s and Kevin’s. Madison is going to lose the twins and then have another daughter with the doctor. And their little girl is Sadie. Cause otherwise, what was the point of introducing her and telling us her name? And showing the scenes with the horse?” one fan questioned.</p>
<p>Will we find answers in ‘This Is Us’ season 5?</p>
<p>Who knows if any of these theories are true. Only time will tell if Brown truly did drop a massive hint for what’s to come. But, we can’t wait to see how season 5 of This Is Us shakes out.

<h3 id="this-is-us-fans-react-to-madison-kevin-season-4-finale-revelation">&lsquo;This Is Us&rsquo; Fans React to Madison-Kevin Season 4 Finale Revelation</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/this-is-us-season-4-finale-madison-kevin-revelation-reaction-1585145437.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
The This Is Us season 4 finale aired on NBC Tuesday night.</p>
<p>During the episode, Kevin finds out that Madison is pregnant with twins and that he is the father.</p>
<p>This Is Us fans who were hoping for Sophie and Kevin to fall in love again were furious, though many think there&rsquo;s still a chance they wind up together.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what folks believe will happen in season 5 of the hit NBC drama.</p>
<p>Last night&rsquo;s This Is Us season 4 finale was a hard one for Sophie and Kevin shippers to process.</p>
<p>Despite it looking like This Is Us writers were going to reignite the two characters&rsquo; love story, they instead threw a curveball that included Kate&rsquo;s BFF Madison announcing she was pregnant with twins &hellip; and that Kevin was the father. What&rsquo;s more, Kevin and Madison&rsquo;s future appeared solidified when the ominous flash-forward scene showed the Pearson brother wearing a wedding band and greeting his two preteen twin kids.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this utterly devastated viewers, who were all but certain high school sweethearts Kevin and Sophie would end up together.</p>
<p>KEVIN IS MEANT TO BE WITH SOPHIE- ITS ALWAYS BEEN HER 😭 so upset it’s Madison #ThisIsUs — Giovanna Panameno (@giovannaaaa94) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>I just feel so betrayed honestly, so disappointed, so full of it, Kevin doesn&rsquo;t deserve this, he doesn&rsquo;t and we as an audience don&rsquo;t deserve it either and it&rsquo;s not even fully closed, just to make us be in pain even more they&rsquo;re showing us Sophie AGAIN, this is torture #ThisIsUs — 𝓛𝑜𝓋𝑒, Serena (@holdontoyou13) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>Then again, there were quite a few who were straight-up refusing to accept this plot twist. In fact, many interpreted Madison&rsquo;s pregnancy news as the writers&rsquo; attempt to throw viewers off, rightfully pointing out that it&rsquo;s still possible for Kevin and Madison to have kids and for him to end up marrying Sophie in the future.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Who did Kevin marry? I don’t believe, for a second, he married Madison. For my money, he and Sophie got back together and kept talking about Good Will Hunting. She’ll raise the kids as her own. The little girl looks like her. Madison is a Sophie proxy. #ThisisUs pic.twitter.com/dVqCqiYroa — TDV, First of Her Name&hellip;🇸🇱🇱🇷🇬🇼🏳️‍🌈 (@dowellvest) March 25, 2020</li>
</ol>
<p>#ThisIsUs I&rsquo;m calling it. Kevin gets his own big 3, twins with Madison and a baby with Cassidy, AND marries Sophie. He literally wins the show! @Dan_Fogelman @justinhartley — Kissy_Estilos (@Kissy_Estilos) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>@justinhartley I sense that in that last scene Kevin is married to Sophie again, not Madison. #ThisIsUs — Lu ⊱✿ (@LandOfLakesGirl) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>How can Sophie and Kevin end up together? Even though we know by the time The Big Three&rsquo;s 40th birthday rolls around that Kevin has a &ldquo;pregnant fiancée,&rdquo; Madison acknowledged during the season 4 finale that she didn&rsquo;t know a thing about the Pearson brother, except that he was madly in love with Sophie. Madison also made it clear that she wanted to have the babies for herself and told Kevin she could take care of the twins on her own if he wanted (though, he later told her he was &ldquo;all in&rdquo;). Knowing all of this, perhaps Madison and Kevin end up in a scenario where they parent their children, but don&rsquo;t get married.</p>
<p>Then again, neither Madison nor Sophie have yet appeared in the flash-forward scene at Kevin&rsquo;s home. Whether this is deliberate or not, hopefully we&rsquo;ll get more clarity on their absences right away when season 5 begins to air this fall.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sophie-Kevin fans should take comfort in what show creator Dan Fogelman told People following the season 4 finale: “There are many more chapters in Kevin’s romantic story &hellip; Kevin has a journey ahead of him.” Bottom line: more twists and turns are coming up, so don&rsquo;t assume Madison and Kevin are the endgame. There&rsquo;s still hope.
