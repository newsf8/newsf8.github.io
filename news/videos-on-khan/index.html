Volume 37, Number 3 / Summer 2012
ASCOTech
Khan Academy and
“Flipping the Classroom”
he very first time that
you’re trying to get your
brain around a new con-
cept, the very last thing
you need is another human being say-
ing, ‘Do you understand this?’”1 This
radical quotation is from Salman Khan,
an MIT and Harvard graduate, former
hedge fund analyst, and founder of
Khan Academy.
Recently featured on 60 Minutes, Khan
Academy is a nonprofit educational or-
ganization that is doing some very ex-
citing things. It has a repository on You
Tube of more than 3,100 video “micro
lectures” covering subjects from math
and science to healthcare and medicine.
The videos are for students to watch at
home and are meant to be paired with
computer exercises found on the Acad-
emy’s Website.2 The strategy of sending
schoolwork home in the form of short
video lectures and doing homework
at school is called “flipping the class-
room.” Should the schools and colleges
of optometry adopt a similar strategy?
For many of us, the volume of mate-
rial we must present to increasingly
large numbers of students can be over-
whelming. Prior to the Information
Age, the most efficient way to present
copious information was the lecture
format. The lecture format was how we
were taught, the same way as our teach-
ers before us, stretching back to ancient
times. We would listen and take notes.
Some optometric education programs
now use a transcription service so tak-
James Kundart OD, MEd, FAAO
“T
ing notes may be unnecessary, as it may
also be for courses that are built around
a good textbook.
Before laptops and tablets were the
norm in classrooms, textbooks were the
tool we used to flesh out the material we
did not understand. Our teachers en-
couraged us to read them before class,
but time constraints often prevented
it. Besides, much benefit could be had
from reading a good text even after the
lecture was presented. For those of us
who did not have an eidetic auditory
memory, it was during the reading of
the textbook that real learning took
place. The lecture was the warm-up.
With our students today, surprisingly
little has changed, except for the very
important fact that textbooks are in-
creasingly irrelevant to today’s class-
room learners. It is one of the ironies
of the computer revolution that in-
formation is more available than ever,
but as more students avoid traditional
print media, they rely largely on what
is presented in the classroom. To many
educators, relying on lecture and class
notes almost exclusively is an inefficient
and limited way to secure information
into long-term memory, which is a ne-
cessity for future patient care.
If there is one source that could replace
textbooks for today’s students, it is on-
line video. Enter You Tube and programs
like Khan Academy. Microsoft founder
Bill Gates was so impressed when he
discovered Khan that he used the free
courses in topics like math and science
to teach his own kids. Subsequently,
both the Gates Foundation and Google
have backed Khan Academy with mil-
lions of dollars in support.
These sorts of financial endorsements
should command the attention of op-
tometric educators. Can flipping the
classroom help to improve graduate
school the same way it might improve
elementary school? While Khan does
not (yet) offer many of its videos on
topics of interest to optometric educa-
tion, several of its principles are poten-
tially of use to us as we teach the eye
doctors of the future.
Principle #1: Asking
Questions About
Something They Should
Already Know is
Embarrassing to Students
Even our best students have holes in
their understanding. Often, this in-
cludes some basic concepts. Without
using textbooks for reference, concepts
that are missed the first time (or forgot-
ten since) may become more and more
shaky. As students progress through
a lecture-based curriculum, one that
doesn’t encourage interrupting to ask
questions to begin with, these missed
concepts can interfere with adding new
knowledge. Avoiding embarrassment is
human nature, so questions remain un-
asked all too often.
Dr. Kundart is the Chairman of the Educational Technology Special Interest Group for the Association of Schools
and Colleges of Optometry. He is a researcher and author and an Associate Professor at the Pacific University
College of Optometry. He can be contacted at (503) 352-2759 or <a href="mailto:kundart@pacificu.edu">kundart@pacificu.edu</a>.
Optometric Education

Volume 37, Number 3 / Summer 2012
Now, consider the possibilities when a
lecture – or better still, a micro lecture
– is recorded for the student to play and
pause at will. This condensed presenta-
tion needs only the basic concepts on a
PowerPoint slide with voice-over audio.
Khan Academy uses a digital whiteboard
(SmoothDraw 3) but no video of the
presenter.3 Now, the student can take in
the lecture when and where he or she is
ready to learn, pausing and rewinding
when a concept does not make sense.
These micro lectures are not hard to make
with a podcast. Many university pro-
grams are already podcasting. At Pacific
University College of Optometry, we use
Camtasia Relay for classroom capture of
video and audio, and iTunes University
to collect the podcasts. However, pod-
casting can be done in a quiet home
office (or closet as Sal Khan reportedly
uses) and doesn’t require a live audience
present, just one to listen to it on their
computers, tablets or MP3 players.
How these targeted podcasts can reach
more students than a traditional lecture
is the subject of the second principle.
Principle #2: One-On-One
Tutoring is More Effective
Than Teaching to the
Middle
One challenge that optometric educa-
tors face is reaching students at differ-
ent levels of achievement. Like all edu-
cators, out of necessity the instructor
often has to adopt an almost utilitarian
philosophy. With the aim of reaching
the most students, many educators
“teach to the middle,” or somewhere be-
tween the most advanced and least ad-
vanced students on the topic. This may
work for the middle of the class but has
the distinct disadvantage of leaving the
upper quartile unchallenged, and the
lower quartile potentially unreached.4
While many other strategies exist, such
as “teaching to the top,” all have the
limitations of the one-size-fits-all lec-
ture style. Yet there is one educational
strategy that is orders of magnitude
more effective than standard classroom
lecture: one-on-one tutoring. While ex-
traordinarily effective, individual tutor-
ing is inefficient, and therefore expen-
sive. It has traditionally been limited to
those who can afford to pay for it for
themselves or their children. However,
in the computer age, must efficiency be
inversely proportional to effectiveness?
Not necessarily. When delivered by a
talented teacher, the recorded micro
lecture is like having a personal tutor.
When done well, the student feels as if
the teacher is right there giving a per-
sonal lesson. This is partly because the
micro lecture can be given at the time
and place of the listener’s choosing.
Also, micro lectures can fit into small
chunks of time.
By definition, the micro lecture is short.
Khan Academy lessons last 10 minutes
on average, which may be approaching
the attention span of the typical student
these days. Thus, it needs to distill infor-
mation to its essence, while not skipping
any critical subtleties. It can and should
be heavy in illustrations as necessary to
teach the salient points. It should also
be unscripted and certainly not read
from a slide. Sal Khan does no video ed-
its. Instead, he re-records each take that
doesn’t come out well in one try. This
preserves the one-on-one nature.
The short, home-based lecture is one half
of flipping the classroom. The other half
is assessment. This takes the form of class-
room-based homework, when students
get to ask questions one-on-one rather
than in front of all their classmates, as
explained in the next principle.
Principle #3: Students
Prefer Self-Paced Learning
to Instructor-Paced Lessons
While listening to micro lectures on an
MP3 player, a student is typically alone,
be it at home, in the car or at the gym.
This should happen before class, when a
student of the flipped classroom will be
expected to practice what was learned.
Khan Academy students are often
ones who have not yet graduated high
school, but here’s how the principle of
self-paced learning might be applied to
optometric education.
Imagine geometric optics lab taught
with a flipped classroom. As currently
taught, the students may work on an
optical bench and may keep hard copy
or virtual lab books in order to learn
how light is affected by lenses, prisms
and filters. Although the emphasis on
some age-old topics (like mathemati-
cal ray-tracing) may be changing, other
things are not. For instance, in many
cases students must still complete their
labs in the assigned lab period, whether
or not they have mastered the principles
being taught. Those who struggle may
go through the motions but be carried
along in part by their lab partner when
they do not understand.
If the classroom is flipped, both lec-
tures and assessments will occur at the
student’s own pace. The latter are done
with computer-based drills given on-
line. The instructor has access to graphs
showing the speed and accuracy of each
student’s answer, and is free to answer
questions even before they arise. The
clock on the wall doesn’t determine how
far each student progresses during class
time, but instead progress is dependent
on each individual student.
Another key to the success of the Khan
techniques is constant assessment.
While every topic comes with exercises
to be practiced in class the next day,
there is some modularity to each lesson.
In other words, in many non-linear top-
ics, students may choose to tackle the
middle or the end of the material first.
For example, a lecture on five related
congenital conditions affecting the eyes
might be flexible as to which order a
student masters them. However, they
must all be mastered.
One might inquire why a student would
need the teacher – or classmates – at all
in this type of model. The answer is that
the flipped classroom encourages col-
laboration. Classmates are encouraged
to assist each other when one is stuck.
Also, the teacher plays the important
role of providing “surgical instruction”
for any students who are stuck on a
concept.5 An instant study group can
be assembled (to the extent allowed by
the Family Educational Rights and Pri-
vacy Act). This is because in the flipped
classroom, it is critical to master one
concept before proceeding, the topic of
the next principle.
Principle #4: Old Concepts
Should be Mastered Before
Moving on to New Ones
Think about the way American educa-
tion traditionally works. First, informa-
tion is delivered in traditional lecture
format with spot checks in the form
of quizzes, midterms and final exams.
Except where practical exams are given,
Optometric Education
106
Volume 37, Number 3 / Summer 2012
such as in optometric procedures or
methods courses, we do not usually ex-
pect that all students will reach mastery
at each assessment. We may recheck as
many areas as we can on the final and
National Board exams, but because ev-
ery student is not required to get an “A,”
this still leaves something to be desired.
In Khan Academy courses, “mastery-
based learning” means students must
get 10 questions in a row correct to
move on to the next lesson.4 When they
do not, they continue to practice the
muddy points until they clear up, in
much the same way optometric proce-
dures or methods courses are taught.
How do optometric educators know
when their students need assistance?
Too often, students don’t know enough
to ask. How many of us have sat
through empty office hours the day
before an exam without seeing a single
student because they were studying
for the exam and did not know which
questions to ask?
For Khan Academy, the answer is the
teacher’s
dashboard.
Performance-
measuring apps, long-used and old hat
in the financial sector from which Sal
Khan came, are novel to educators at all
levels. Perhaps some have seen real-time
test results roll in on learning manage-
ment software like Blackboard or Moo-
dle. Using a tablet or other portable
interface, the instructor can circulate
around the classroom and know exactly
where each student may be excelling —
or struggling.
All too often, optometric educators may
find mathematics is the area of difficulty,
which is the topic of the next principle.
Principle #5: Math is a
Stumbling Block for Many
Students Today
Schools and colleges of optometry face
a challenge of homogeneity. Most in-
coming students, as high as 85%, were
biology majors as undergraduates. The
reasons for this are obvious when the
prerequisites of optometry school are
compared with those for various under-
graduate majors.
For all the strengths of the average biol-
ogy major in ocular anatomy, physiology
and disease, as a rule, mathematics is not
the strong suit. Fortunately, the Khan
Academy techniques are most easily ap-
plied to very concrete subjects like math-
ematics, including optics.3 In fact, most
of the existing 3,100 Khan Academy
videos on topics of interest to optometry
students are currently in optics.
For most students who struggle, the
problem in American education in
mathematics certainly precedes optom-
etry school. Many intelligent students
may not have ever been required to at-
tain mastery in basic arithmetic, algebra
or trigonometry. While the prevalence
of mathematical illiteracy in American
society is on the rise, there is some dis-
agreement as to the reason. Some blame
the use of calculators from an early age.
Others blame the use of manipulatives
like geoboards instead of paper-and-
pencil exercises.
Whatever the cause, it is not the sole
duty of optometric educators to bring
about a mathematical renaissance. How-
ever, if we wish our interns to be able to
quickly calculate a net add or conver-
sions from plus to minus cylinder, drills
to practice these conversions should be
done until the student attains mastery.
Principle #6: Be a Guide
on the Side, Not a Sage on
the Stage
This catchphrase of the flipped class-
room movement has been around in
educational circles since at least the
1990s.6 Pragmatists can legitimately
point out that it is a nice sentiment,
but may be much easier to say than to
implement. Proponents will admit it
is easier for educators to imagine con-
structing new courses in the flipped
classroom format than to imagine con-
verting pre-existing standard lectures.
While some topics in optometric educa-
tion may lend themselves to this format
better than others, with preparation of
micro lectures and practice problems,
the flipped classroom will come to life.
Personally, I plan to attempt some ver-
sion of these techniques in my 40-stu-
dent elective this summer. The long
nights of the warmer months may lend
themselves to both creating and listen-
ing to micro lectures, while the smaller
class size (for us) may work better for
me to be a guide on the side.
In the words of Bill Gates at the end
of the Technology, Education and De-
sign (TED) lecture by Salman Khan: “I
think you’ve just got a glimpse of the
future of education.”1
