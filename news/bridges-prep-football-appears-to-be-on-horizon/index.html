<p>We are halfway through June and as of this writing it does appear there will be a high school football season in Georgia for 2020. Everyone can exhale a sigh of relief at this moment, at least for now anyway.</p>
<p>Not that long ago I would not have been confident saying the chances were good we would have a season. Yet it seems our world has been turned on its ear since March. A health crisis which, like everything else in today’s world, has turned political. It’s hard to imagine we have reached that point.</p>
<p>We’ll stay out of politics for these musings and just be thankful we will have high school athletics this fall. That includes cross country, softball and volleyball in addition to the action on the gridiron.</p>
<p>High school sports are important for a variety of reason. For student-athletes, being involved in extra-curricular activities is a vital part of the education process itself. You cannot be a well-rounded student by simply showing up for class each day. That’s important, of course, but only a part of the formula.</p>
<p>Being a part of a group or team — whether they are centered around sports, drama, cheerleading, band or 4-H — is something all students should take advantage of. Each provides valuable lessons which add to the overall learning experience gained from the classroom.</p>
<p>In this part of the country high school football and fall go hand-in-hand. Football is the biggest revenue-generating event in high school and helps provide support for other sports.</p>
<p>It has been really difficult to comprehend that there might not be any games beginning in August. If that decision had been made it would have not only crushed the athletic department budgets for this school year — probably beyond — but it would have been a major setback in other ways.</p>
<p>This newspaper, for example, devotes a great deal of resources into covering high school football. The reason is simple. Those who run it understand how important football is to this community.</p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to find a community newspaper such as The Covington News which devotes more to high school football coverage on Friday nights. In a time when many daily newspapers don’t even feature high school football scores in their Saturday editions, the paper you are reading now not only provides scores but offers game stories, stats and numerous photographs from the games which were played just a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>Local football teams were able to begin some organized activities last week. It has not evolved back to full-scale workouts but at least there is something. Until June 8 there remained a great deal of doubt as to what was going to happen.</p>
<p>The 2020 season is shaping up to be an exciting one locally. Some teams have new head coaches. Some will look to continue their recent paths to the postseason. Some are simply trying to improve the overall state of their respective program.</p>
<p>Football is certainly one of the most demanding sports to take part in. It’s not easy and the workouts this time of year quickly test one’s inner desire to be part of a team.</p>
<p>Unless something unforeseen happens, we will have high school football in 2020. Players, coaches, fans, parents, school officials and even newspaper staffs are all breathing a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Timing is an important aspect of life. Had this health crisis landed on us in June or July then there likely would not have been a football season. While some things may be a little different in 2020, at least we are on track now to have games on Friday nights.</p>
<p>We are still approximately three months away but the players and coaches are back at work even with some limitations. It won’t be much longer before toe-meets-leather and an important part of Americana will begin again.</p>
<p>It’s funny. Most of us until recently probably have never given one thought to there not being football in the fall. It will probably make us appreciate it even more.</p>
<p>Chris Bridges has been a community newspaper journalist for three decades and is a former sports editor for The Covington News and The Walton Tribune. He welcomes feedback about this column at <a href="mailto:pchrisbridges@gmail.com">pchrisbridges@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="trailblazing-trainer-ronnie-barnes-next-challenge-is-giants-coronavirus-safety">&ldquo;Trailblazing trainer Ronnie Barnes’ next challenge is Giants coronavirus safety&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/rb_2121.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
He was one of 20 black students chosen to integrate an all-white middle school in Wilson, N.C., because if young Ronnie Barnes, so good and bright and tough on the inside, couldn’t weather the storm and inspire change, who could?</p>
<p>He was an intern in 1976 when Hall of Famer Harry Carson was drafted by the Giants. Sixteen months ago, he was recognized for a lifetime of achievement at the Fritz Pollard Foundation’s Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Salute to Excellence Awards, and it was only fitting it was Carson, the foundation’s executive director, who introduced him.</p>
<p>He cared for Wellington Mara at the end of the Hall of Fame Giants owner’s life, stayed by his bedside as if he were his son, has cared for football Giants from the time Mara made him the NFL’s first African-American head trainer in 1980 until now.</p>
<p>Ronnie Barnes, senior vice president of medical services/head athletic trainer, is revered and respected at 1925 Giants Drive and across the National Football League, and he has been revered and respected by Giants across the decades, from Carson to Lawrence Taylor to Bill Parcells to Tom Coughlin to Eli Manning.</p>
<p>With Manning retired, Ronnie Barnes, 68 years young, stands alone as The Pride of the Giants.</p>
<p>In his role for the New York Football Giants, Barnes is the one quarterbacking them through this pandemic. He is the one across the decades who has stood as an unwavering, towering symbol of fairness, compassion and integrity.</p>
<p>“I was one of the few students chosen to integrate our public school system,” Barnes told The Post. “It was referred to as the Freedom of Choice program. There was some attrition with my classmates from Charles I. Coon Junior High School and even more as we advanced to Fike High School.”</p>
<p>Young Ronnie Barnes never blinked.</p>
<p>“My parents and teachers told us it would not be easy, but that it would be an opportunity for a better education,” he said. “Funding at that time was not equal among the black and white schools. Resources were thin at the black schools, and I was aware of that even at my young age.</p>
<p>“My sixth-grade teacher took me and several other students to a meeting where they explained the Freedom of Choice program. They told us that because of our grades and state testing, we stood the best chance to succeed in this new program.</p>
<p>“Throughout the experience, I felt a tremendous responsibility to represent my race and my family in a positive light.”</p>
<p>And before long, he had a dream.</p>
<p>“I made friends with white students and became involved in every club and other extracurricular activities, including sports,” Barnes said. “I was introduced to athletic training in junior high school by Gus Andrews, a football coach. They sent me to summer camps to learn how to tape ankles and render first-aid care to athletes. I knew right away I wanted to go off to college to become a professional athletic trainer.</p>
<p>“On the first day at Coon Junior High School, the principal said, ‘It’s nice to see so many bright, shiny faces,’ and laughter erupted. That was probably one of my first and few uneasy moments. The administration and faculty were welcoming. I never had a single issue with the principals and teachers. I give them tremendous credit for embracing integration.”</p>
<p>Barnes, 20 years after Jackie Robinson endured a personal hell when he made his MLB debut in Brooklyn in 1947 as the sport’s first African-American, turned the other cheek to the racists.</p>
<p>“The only outlier was at the high school, where there were a few white students who resented us being there, but overall, besides some name-calling in the halls, it was not an unbearable experience,” Barnes said. “I really don’t recall any fights or conflicts. My parents did a great job in encouraging me to ignore the remarks and to realize that I was there for an education. My parents told me in later years they had feared for my safety.</p>
<p>“The worst thing that ever happened was we took a bus that we did not usually ride to the downtown area. A girl stood up on her chair and threw spitballs and called me and my friends names all the way to downtown.</p>
<p>“She said we should die.</p>
<p>“Needless to say, we got off the bus early and walked the rest of the way.</p>
<p>“In high school, we had a drama teacher who wore a full confederate uniform, including the hat, and strutted the halls daily, and that was unnerving.”</p>
<p>Barnes would become the first certified athletic trainer to graduate East Carolina’s sports medicine program before earning a master’s degree at Michigan State, where he was the head trainer and an assistant professor. Most of his Freedom of Choice classmates advanced to top universities.</p>
<p>“A few of the black students did not have the patience and tolerance, and they left the school or did not come back the next year,” Barnes said. “I understood why some of my classmates didn’t want to stay. I was there for one thing — a good education, and I received it. I worked my way through because I didn’t care what anybody said or thought. I was focused on the academics and the opportunity.</p>
<p>“It’s human nature to allow the negative and mean-spirited language to distract. Nobody wants to be where they don’t feel completely welcome. But I wasn’t going to let that distract me. And the truth is there were quite a few of my white classmates who were supportive. Several are my friends to this day.</p>
<p>“We made it our school.”</p>
<p>Young Ronnie Barnes in 1968 befriended a man named Dr. A. Tyson Jennette, who would become his mentor and lifelong friend, and was an orthopedic surgeon for 55 years before retiring last year. Jennette was the Fike High School team physician and Barnes was a student trainer.</p>
<p>“He taught me medicine at a very early age,” Barnes said. “He has been a real inspiration for me. He practiced medicine in a small town but went back to Duke University Medical Center every week for grand rounds. He taught me the important lesson, that you must continue to learn every day in medicine. We roomed together the night before one of our high school championship football games. We joked that might be the first time a black person and a white person had ever shared a hotel room.</p>
<p>“I cannot say enough about his incredible belief and trust in me. My parents have passed away. I have the same love and affection for him and his wife Peggy as I had for Ann and Wellington Mara.”</p>
<p>The feeling has always been mutual.</p>
<p>“He was like a sponge,” Jennette recalled. “He wanted to learn everything.”</p>
<p>Jennette understood perfectly why young Ronnie Barnes was selected to be part of the beginnings of historic change.</p>
<p>“I think it was because of his personality and his determination,” Jennette said. “He’s the son of a minister, and he was a perfect kind of guy to begin integration. He didn’t tell me it was easy for him, but everybody liked him, and he was accepted, and I think that was pretty nice for a troubled time back then.”</p>
<p>Today’s protests make Barnes hopeful that together we can yet make this our country:</p>
<p>“What is happening across our country is inspiring,” Barnes said. “I have lived through a couple of important moments. This is another extremely important moment in our nation’s history. We all have an opportunity to create real change. Having gone through segregation and integration and witnessed those changes, I have hope that this generation of all races will help us make positive changes to our society.</p>
<p>“I have traveled to 70 countries. There are racial disparities all over the world. I have confidence that we can work through this as a nation.”</p>
<p>Barnes also has confidence the NFL can work through COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Coronavirus is a dangerous and often deadly virus,” he said. “I believe through education and safeguards we can have a football season. It is a challenge since the spread of the virus is not over. The great people of New Jersey and New York have done an outstanding job of adhering to the protocols that the scientific and medical community outlined. That is why we have been able to get back to this point. We have to continue to be vigilant. We all will continue to discuss what is the smartest, best next step.</p>
<p>“I started working on a plan for this virus the week after I came back from the [early-March draft] combine. We assembled key employees and educated them on the approaching novel coronavirus. We taught them how epidemics can spread into pandemics. We went to work right away to protect our players and employees. They did find it daunting that I took their temperatures at the meeting with a temporal scanner. We are still working to make a safe environment for our players and staff.”</p>
<p>Members of the organization will notice 6-foot social distancing markers on the sidewalk outside Quest Diagnostics Training Center. Inside the sanitized facility, there will be signs urging those who feel sick to stay home, there will be masks and mask instructions and gloves and arrows on the floor.</p>
<p>Ronnie Barnes’ work never ends.</p>
<p>“I’ve got the utmost confidence in Ronnie Barnes in all the decisions we make as a team,” Joe Judge told The Post. “He works hand in hand with us as coaches, he has the players’ interests at heart, and he’s been here through a long history of the organization and knows a lot of the progression of the years and how they piece together. He’s been a great resource for me.”</p>
<p>The Giants are in good hands.</p>
<p>“I have no doubts that the Giants will go above and beyond all protocol to keep everyone in the Giants facility safe,” Eli Manning told The Post, “from the players, to the coaches to every administrator. Every employee that comes through the building will be in good hands.</p>
<p>“And I know that because I’m sure that Ronnie Barnes will be making a lot of the decisions to keep that place and keep the people safe, and no one cares more about people and their well-being than Ronnie.</p>
<p>“I know that firsthand from how helpful he was to me over my career, and also to my wife, my kids, my parents, my mother- and father-in-law — anybody who was going through any sort of medical issues — Ronnie was the first person that I talked to about it, and he went above and beyond what a trainer should do to make sure that they were getting the best treatment in the best hands.</p>
<p>“So I know that the Giants will handle this pandemic as smoothly as possible.”</p>
<p>Barnes won’t be wearing No. 10 … no Giant will again. But the franchise is counting on him being every bit as clutch as Eli Manning.</p>
<p>Once Giants, Only Giants.

<h3 id="face-masks-hybrid-schooling-discussed-by-reopening-working-groups---delaware-state-news">&ldquo;Face masks, hybrid schooling discussed by reopening working groups - Delaware State News&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://delawarestatenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/school_backpack.jpg" alt="img">
Conversations spanning children wearing face masks, managing athletics and keeping hybrid schooling possibilities equitable continued as the reopening schools working groups wrapped up their third week of discussions.</p>
<p>The working groups were continuing conversations from last week about what school would look like under a minimal to moderate spread scenario, which could see significant changes to typical operations.</p>
<p>In this scenario, schools opening would be situation dependent and could include temporary closures or hybrid scenarios — where students are learning through in-person and virtual components.</p>
<p>In the Health and Wellness group, discussions focused on considerations regarding screening students and responding to positive cases in both student and staff, in addition to dining and gathering and athletics.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the bigger changes would be dining, where it is suggested that students eat in classrooms if possible and school meals should be delivered to those classrooms. Otherwise, meals in cafeterias should be staggered, with six feet of distance between students.</p>
<p>“In the schools I’ve worked, they’ve been at capacity. Several of these things are going to be really difficult decisions for schools to make,” said Stacy Greenly, a counselor at Polytech High School. “In my school we already have three lunches, we may need to have six lunches to space students out.”</p>
<p>But, Dafne Carnright, family services program manager for Autism Delaware, pointed out that those extra time slots would need to be at fair lunch times.</p>
<p>“Adding extra lunches may mean that we either need to find other spaces for kids to eat lunch or kids will be eating lunch at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. and parents have long had concerns that, ‘In order to be ready for learning, my kid cannot be hungry,’” she said. “And so if you try to make extra lunches, amongst a bunch of other concerns to make that happen, we need to not forget that kids can’t eat lunch at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. and there’s only so much time in the school day and space within the building.”</p>
<p>Sue Smith, a nurse at Mispillion Elementary, noted that one of the biggest concerns is cleaning. If schools open up other alternatives, like having meals in classes, the gym, hallways or large entry ways, they still need staff to sanitize after the meals.</p>
<p>“There’s just a lot, without a lot of staff power,” she said.</p>
<p>Outside of dining, gathering in this scenario would see less than 50 students together at once, with no parents or grandparents permitted. Off-site field trips would be discontinued.</p>
<p>Athletics, and what would be feasible in this scenario, was debated. While the suggestions state that some sports can be permitted, like golf, track and field and non-close-contact sports, others like football, wrestling, basketball would not.</p>
<p>“Athletics and mental health go hand-in-hand for a lot of students,” said Ms. Greenly. “There’s a lot of students who are really depressed right now, they lost maybe their senior season of high school, they lost some time, they have goals and ambitions and not getting to do athletics is affecting their mental health.”</p>
<p>Others pointed to the disparate rules between different sports. State Rep. Mike Smith noted that some students rely on scholarships in their athletics and this could have an impact. Whatever the outcome of recommendations, though, State Sen. Anthony Delcollo said that he defers to science and data for whether sports should be permitted, but this can’t be an arbitrary process for determining what can and can’t happen in this scenario.</p>
<p>“The reason I say this is because I’ve heard the examples, and I can’t respond critically to these examples because there’s certainly logic to them, that people can golf but that a very, very large facility like some furniture outlets couldn’t at the same time have appointments and aggressive cleaning and social distancing does not hold up to scrutiny from the view of the public or from the view of just basic common sense,” he said.</p>
<p>Having children wear masks was another hurdle in the discussion. Suggestions would be that students wear them at all times, except for meals. Privacy or barrier screens should be placed on desks.</p>
<p>Policing facemasks and potential disciplinary action will be difficult, noted Caesar Rodney School District Superintendent Kevin Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>“I certainly understand the science behind this and I certainly support the science behind the facemask and understand it, but I think that this particular recommendation is almost impossible to enforce. I think that it puts schools and administrators and teachers in a very difficult position,” he said. “We’ve heard the challenges of perhaps a kindergarten student having a facemask, we hear about our special needs students who may not be able to wear facemasks. What recommendation will the committee make when a student at the middle school or high school level simply says, ‘I’m not going to wear a facemask,’ or ‘I don’t want to do that’?”</p>
<p>On the other side of things, the Operations and Services working group’s conversation kept cycling to what to do about students having to leave the building for extended closures or splitting into a hybrid schedule.</p>
<p>Jeff Taschner, executive director for the Delaware State Education Association, said that there are certain items educators take for granted that their students may have: pencils, paper, etc.</p>
<p>“It would probably be smart to prepare ahead of time to have educators and districts identify, if we have to go from in person to a moderate community spread situation where we’re having short term dismissals and/or we’re going to remote learning, what are the consumables we’d normally be giving kids in school that they’ll need at home? Do we have them readily available and how do we deliver them?” he said.</p>
<p>“I think about this year when we were in school and on March 13 people went home for a weekend and they never went back and the difficulty in making sure kids had the consumables and the support and resources,” he continued.</p>
<p>Oliver Gumbs, co-chairman of the committee and director of business operations for Cape Henlopen School District, said that perhaps school leadership should meet with their chief financial officers to determine the budgeting because this year could mean different financial demands.</p>
<p>Creative solutions of how to teach students if half are in school and half are at home were also at play. Stacey Clark, director of instruction and student services at First State Military Academy, and Kristine Bewley, manager of information systems at Red Clay Consolidated School District, suggested alternatives: teachers utilizing webcams for streaming, DVDs for giving out class instruction or thumb drives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Academics and Equity weighed what a strong instructional start to the year would look like for students and teachers.</p>
<p>Members pointed to making sure the start of school is individualized for the students, building in more instruction time for educators and diverse instructional materials and delivery methods.</p>
<p>“I hope we think about process and what I mean by that is we have really solid orientation for parents, for teachers, so that they understand the rules, the expectations at the beginning of the year because it’s going to be a rolling kind of year and I hope we really give time to process which means we need to be connecting, communicating and consistent in whatever we decide,” said Maria Alonso, board president for Academia Antonia Alonso Charter School.</p>
<p>Allison Castellanos, an ESL professor at Delaware Technical &amp; Community College, agreed, noting that open house opportunities for parents where they can learn the different online models teachers turned to during remote learning would be helpful.</p>
<p>Caitlyn Thomas, the student representative, said that support for students goes miles.</p>
<p>When conversation turned to which students would stay home and which would return to school in a hybrid scenario, Ms. Thomas asked how do they choose?</p>
<p>“That’s not equitable itself,” she said. “Personally as a student of course I want to be back in class. I would feel a certain type of way if I knew some of my classmates were and I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>She said that, in her school, there were even and odd days and students could have corresponding days where they are in the building and home.</p>
<p>Ashley Giska, assistant superintendent of Laurel School District and co-chairman of the committee, said other groups are certainly considering that.</p>
<p>“Those synchronous learning experiences are valuable for students — every student — and that’s something that does have to be factored into our equity conversations,” he said.</p>
<p>Health and Wellness meets Tuesdays, the Academics and Equity meets Wednesdays and Operations and Services meets Thursdays. All meetings are scheduled for 5 to 7 p.m. and can be streamed on DOE’s Youtube channel.</p>
<p>Public participation is encouraged, though it will be done virtually. Participants may submit public comments to an email address, <a href="mailto:reopeningideas@doe.k12.de.us">reopeningideas@doe.k12.de.us</a>, or by voicemail to 302-735-4244. The department will transcribe the comments and post them online, to the department’s website (<a href="http://www.doe.k12.de.us">www.doe.k12.de.us</a>). The comments will be shared across the working groups.

<h3 id="acac-ceo-provides-update-on-leagues-fall-season-plan-following-u-sports-fall-season-cancelation">&ldquo;ACAC CEO provides update on leagues fall season plan following U-Sports fall season cancelation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/socast-superdesk/media/20200608180616/163a63f1-e4a3-430a-8a98-dac931ae9586.jpg" alt="img">
League CEO Mark Kozak says that they have not made any decisions on what to do with their fall sports calendar in 2020, and there is still lots of time before they have to decide on how to proceed.</p>
<p>“We certainly pay attention to what Canada West and U-Sports are doing. We are two different organizations and we don’t necessarily always do things the exact same way. The ACAC is in the middle of a planning process and we haven’t ruled anything out, but that doesn’t mean that we’re going to immediately announce that we are going to forego the fall season.”</p>
<p>“If we can offer our fall sports in some manner, that’s the approach that we’re taking and we’re working through all the different factors that have to be considered. We think it’s a little premature to immediately announce that the fall season is out of the question.”</p>
<p>One of the advantages that the ACAC has that Canada West and U-Sports do not, is that all games in the ACAC take place within Alberta. Canada West teams that play in U-Sports have to play games throughout the year against schools from BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.</p>
<p>Kozak noted that the biggest thing that has to happen in order for them to have a fall season has to do with the province and their re-opening plan. There is hope that by September, sports will be allowed to resume in the province.</p>
<p>“Obviously, there are some changes in the way that education is going to be delivered this fall and we understand that athletics goes hand in hand with that,” said Kozak. “If our senior administrators are supportive and believe there’s some value to having athletics offered this fall then that certainly helps our cause.”</p>
<p>A fall season is key for student-athletes that attend Grande Prairie Regional College as the school has both a men’s and women’s soccer team and a cross-country team.</p>
<p>Kozak says that if there is a cancelation of a fall season, he expects that the schools will honour scholarships for students, but each school has to make its own decision in regards to that.</p>
<p>Kozak adds that the ACAC will be holding be a special general meeting held on June 25, where the ACAC intends to present options for schedules, formats, and a start date and have its members vote on it.</p>
<p>There is also an opportunity for some schools to bow out of a sport for the season if they feel that they cannot deliver it in 2020-2021.</p>
<p>“We know that coaches and athletes want to know the plans for 2020-2021 as soon as possible because people’s lives are in the balance. They want to know whether they should return to their institution or want to pursue their sport. We hope that they are attending for their educational purposes primarily, but we know that sport will influence some student’s decisions, so we want to have that information out and circulating as soon as possible, and June 25 is that date.”</p>
<p>If the fall season is canceled, Kozak said that he and the rest of the ACAC schools are confident that sports like basketball and hockey could be completed within the winter semester. However, as of now, they are still focused on the fall season going ahead.

<h3 id="top-rutgers-sports-booster-lands-powerful-role-at-the-university">&ldquo;Top Rutgers sports booster lands powerful role at the university&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/k99Ci_92_lJ-FLNED7UjUKd3X3o=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/BCM52TKO6ZEZFEPVMKPRRVZHQ4.JPG" alt="img">
Amy Towers, the wealthy philanthropist whose family has donated millions to Rutgers University athletics, is officially a member of the university’s Board of Governors.</p>
<p>Towers was confirmed Monday by the state Senate, putting her in a position to influence nearly every major decision made at the state university.</p>
<p>Her appointment by Gov. Phil Murphy last year was criticized by some faculty members who questioned Towers’ higher education acumen, despite her experience in business and philanthropy. But Murphy’s office said Towers will bring “incredible value” based on her experience running a multi-billion dollar financial institution and managing philanthropic and humanitarian aid programs across the globe.</p>
<p>“I am appreciative of everyone who has supported my nomination and I look forward to serving Rutgers,” Towers said in statement.</p>
<p>Power, money and influence typically go hand-in-hand with seats on college governing boards. It’s common for big donors, or prospective donors, to fill those roles at Rutgers and other colleges, even if they have little or no experience in higher education.</p>
<p>Rutgers’ 15-member board is primarily filled by business executives, lawyers and financial managers, including major donors like Greg Brown, the Motorola CEO who served as board chair and remains on the board.</p>
<p>Towers has gradually become more influential at the university. She already served on the board that oversees Rutgers’ fundraising and recently was on the search committee that helped find incoming university President Jonathan Holloway.</p>
<p>Rutgers’ faculty union has opposed many nominees in the past, instead asking for leaders who know more about higher education and can challenge the administration’s academic decisions. The board approves tuition increases, controls the budget and has the authority to hire and fire the university president.</p>
<p>“Somebody who has been so useful in the sideshow is now promoted into running the place,&quot; said David Hughes, then-vice president of the Rutgers faculty union, last year. &ldquo;That doesn’t make any sense to us.”</p>
<p>Richard Ebright, a decorated microbiologist and prominent Rutgers professor, tweeted that Towers’ donations to Rutgers’ athletics make her “a parasite and an idiot.” He later said his intent was to question whether she is truly interested in the academic mission of the university.</p>
<p>Towers was previously married to hedge fund billionaire Larry Robbins and was chief operating officer of Glenview Capital Management, the firm the couple led. She and new husband Jeff Towers, a business executive, were living in New Jersey when Rutgers joined the Big Ten, and they adopted the Scarlet Knights.</p>
<p>Jeff Towers was nearly hired for a recruiting job by former football coach Kyle Flood before NJ Advance Media reported that Towers had anonymously donated $1 million to hike Flood’s salary by $200,000 a year.</p>
<p>The following year, his name was in the headlines again after NJ Advance Media reported he violated NCAA rules by tweeting at three potential recruits. Rutgers itself reported the incident as a recruiting violation, albeit a minor one, because boosters are barred from direct contact with recruits.</p>
<p>The controversy has been often overshadowed by the couple’s contributions though. Notably, the Towers’ $5 million gift helped Rutgers build an $8.5 million sports practice facility.</p>

<h3 id="savannah-country-days-lamar-kirkley-wins-teacher-of-the-year-award">&ldquo;Savannah Country Day’s Lamar Kirkley wins Teacher of the Year award&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.savannahnow.com/storyimage/GA/20200617/SPORTS/200619299/AR/0/AR-200619299.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Savannah Country Day’s Lamar Kirkley was recently honored for his work with students and athletes as the recipient of the 2020 Teacher of the Year Award. The award was sponsored by Grainger Nissan and presented by the Exchange Club of Savannah.</p>
<p>Kirkley was a standout basketball player at Armstrong State in his playing days and has coached a bit of everything during his 45-year career at SCD. He was the head boys basketball coach for the Hornets for 24 years, coached the cross country squads for 21 seasons, and has been the school’s tennis coach for the past two decades. He also served as the SCD athletic director for seven years.</p>
<p>Kirkley has won 43 region titles as a coach and has taken home region coach of the year honors in various sports more than 40 times. The Savannah Athletic Hall of Fame inductee has been named the Savannah Morning News coach of the year multiple times in multiple sports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the awards I’ve won have to do with sports, so to get one for teaching is special,&rdquo; said Kirkley, 68, who still teaches physical education at SCD for pre-K through fifth grade. &ldquo;To me, coaching is teaching and teaching is coaching — the two go hand in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirkley said he enjoys working with the younger students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love the little ones because it gives you a chance to see them grow and develop. You see them move up to middle school, high school and then graduate from college. And I’m old enough that I’m teaching some of my former students kids now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Known for his ability to relate well with students, colleagues, parents and players, Kirkley said he has no plans to slow down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be singled out for this award means a lot to me,&rdquo; Kirkley said. &ldquo;I still have a desire to teach and I have no plans to give it up as long as it stays fun for me. I always say I haven’t worked a day in my life since I left the farm — I get to play at work every day.&rdquo;
