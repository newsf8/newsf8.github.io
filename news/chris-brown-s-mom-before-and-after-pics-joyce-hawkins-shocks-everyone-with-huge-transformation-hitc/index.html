<h3 id="royalty-brown-6-reunites-with-baby-brother-aeko-11-mos-after-chris-brown-takes-them-on-vacation">&ldquo;Royalty Brown, 6, Reunites With Baby Brother Aeko, 11 Mos., After Chris Brown Takes Them On Vacation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/chris-brown-daughter-royalty-son-aeko-ammika-harris-mega-ftr.jpg" alt="img">
Chris Brown shared two new pics, including one of a smiling Royalty posing with her little brother Aeko, to his Instagram and playfully called them ‘double trouble’.</p>
<p>Chris Brown, 31, showed off a reunion between his eldest daughter Royalty, 6, and his 11-month-old son Aeko on Oct. 25 and it was adorable to see! The proud dad took to Instagram to share two brand new vacation photos, including one that showed the two siblings posing together for the camera. In the cute snapshot, Royalty is sitting outside with her feet in a pool while wearing a white T-shirt and denim shorts and she is holding onto her baby brother’s arm as he stands in the pool in a gray, orange, and green Gucci T-shirt.</p>
<p>In another pic, Chris is standing on top of an outdoor mattress at the beach while wearing a white graphic T-shirt, red shorts, a red hat, white socks, and white sneakers. He is standing next to a smiling Royalty, who is wearing a pink sleeveless top with stripes and red shorts, as she stands in the opposite direction and holds onto the top of his hand. “DOUBLE TROUBLE 😊❤️,” Chris playfully wrote in the caption for the photos.</p>
<p>Chris’ latest post featuring Royalty’s reunion with her little brother comes after he’s been taking in the precious moments of his own reunion with the tot. The doting dad was separated from Aeko and his mother Ammika Harris, who have been living in Germany, for several months due to the coronavirus, so when he confirmed that they were together once again with a snapshot earlier this month, it was truly endearing. “Made it,” he confidently wrote in the caption.</p>
<p>On Oct. 22, Ammika also shared a sweet photo of Aeko meditating on a beach during the tropical vacation they’ve been on with Chris and Royalty. The mini-me was wearing red shorts in the photo as he closed his eyes and held one hand up. “Meditating and you?” the cheeky mom wrote alongside the pic.</p>
<p>Chris is taking in the joys of spending time with Aeko and a source told us earlier this month just how much he loves his second child. “Chris is obviously thrilled to be reunited with Aeko after all this time,” the insider EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Chris loves Aeko with all his heart and he’s been keeping updated on every aspect of his life along the way while they’ve been apart with videos, photos, and by FaceTiming with Ammika. But to be reunited in person and to be able to hold Aeko, play with him, hug him, and kiss him means even more.”

<h3 id="chris-browns-fans-notice-wedding-ring-on-his-finger-in-a-photo-hugging-his-son--see-reactions">&ldquo;Chris Brown&rsquo;s Fans Notice Wedding Ring on His Finger in a Photo Hugging His Son — See Reactions&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.amomama.com/42a4c81b04660f69dda385d1ed736efc.jpg?width=650&amp;height=340" alt="img">
When Chris Brown shared an innocuous photo of himself with his baby boy, Aeko on his Instagram stories, he might not have expected his eagle-eyed fans to notice a sparkler on his ring finger. Here is the photo that had fans speculating that he is engaged.</p>
<p>Chris Brown might be officially off the market. Recently, the singer took to his Instagram stories to share a photo of himself holding his cute baby son, Aeko, but there was something else that stood out.</p>
<p>In the candid photo, Brown held the little one close as he looked away from the camera. Dressed in a hoodie, Aeko looked super cute as usual and was sucking on one of his fingers.</p>

<p>FANS FLOODED THE COMMENTS SECTION</p>
<p>The official Instagram page of The Shade Room shared the snapshot. Almost immediately, the post was flooded with hundreds of comments. Most of them gushed about how cute the father and son duo looks.</p>
<p>There were many who said that Aeko is his father&rsquo;s mini-me. Meanwhile, some users shared that they see no resemblance between the two, but all in all, it was a popular opinion that the little one is in fact Brown&rsquo;s copy.</p>

<p>FANS NOTICED THE RING</p>
<p>Aside from the cute baby face and father-son bonding moment, there was one other thing that Brown&rsquo;s fans noticed. On his ring finger, he had a big sparkling diamond ring that very much resembled the kind that people exchange when they say &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there is one thing that his fans know, it is that the singer will speak when he wants to.</p>
<p>STICKING WITH THE OBVIOUS</p>
<p>Now, it is possible that Brown chose to wear the ring on that particular finger just because he felt like it. Or he might have been subconsciously fiddling with it and it just so happened that the ring ended up in that finger.</p>
<p>But fans were not ready to entertain or even imagine those scenarios, because the only obvious thought that would cross anybody&rsquo;s mind upon seeing a person with a sparkler on the ring finger is that they tied the knot or someone proposed to them.</p>
<p>NO COMMENTS FROM CHRIS YET</p>
<p>As fans continue to speculate, Brown himself has not commented on the matter. This is not the first time that eagle-eyed fans expressed their curiosity over the singing sensation&rsquo;s marital status.</p>
<p>When Brown shared a photo of himself cuddling his baby son back in December, it gave his fans a perfect opportunity to zoom in on the ring on his finger and check it out. Excitedly, they swarmed the comments section to ask whether he had a wife and who that is.</p>

<p>NO STRANGER TO RUMORS AND SPECULATIONS</p>
<p>Brown and his baby mama, Ammika Harris may have parted ways many months ago, but the duo&rsquo;s occasional flirty messages on Instagram have led their fans to believe that they might still be an item.</p>
<p>The R&amp;B star is no stranger to rumors and controversies. If there is one thing that his fans know, it is that the singer will speak when he wants to. Until then, the only thing fans can do is guess.

<h3 id="chris-browns-mom-joyce-hawkins-shows-off-a-makeup-free-selfie--see-fan-reactions">&ldquo;Chris Brown&rsquo;s Mom Joyce Hawkins Shows off a Makeup-Free Selfie — See Fan Reactions&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.amomama.com/386c2fb62af7a98607c32d2ae8186496.jpg?width=650&amp;height=340" alt="img">
Joyce Hawkins, mother of American singer-songwriter Chris Brown showed off her makeup-free face in a selfie, and fans could not get over the look.</p>
<p>In a new post on her Instagram feed, Joyce Hawkins, mother of American singer, dancer, and actor, Chris Brown, showed off her bare face in a makeup-free selfie, and fans could not stop gushing.</p>
<p>In the photo, Hawkins was seen standing by a clear blue swimming pool as she posed. She had her curly black and red hair packed into a messy bun with the locks cascading down the sides of her face.</p>

<p>Hawkins&rsquo; face was also partially hidden behind a matching red and black face mask. She was clad in a red attire that matched her whole look, but the rest of the view was hidden outside the picture frame.</p>
<p>She also had no makeup on and the sun did a great number on her smooth skin as it shone through the trees overhead. Some fans praised her beauty while others expressed their love for her hair. Beneath the picture, she wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;ALL MASK IN ALL STYLES SOLD OUT!!! THANK YOU SO SO MUCH. I STILL HAVE A FEW OF THE BUNNY MASK LEFT IN KID SIZE ONLY!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawkins is not new to dazzling her fans with beautiful pictures of her age-defying look. Over the last months, her youthful look has continued to remain a topic of discussion among her followers.</p>
<p>Last month, she posted a stunning selfie on her Instagram feed that left her fans gushing. In the photo, she had her dark luscious curls packed up into her signature bun with the rest of the locks cascading down the sides of her face as she gazed into the camera.</p>
<p>After Brown&rsquo;s home got robbed in 2015, the concerned mother voiced her opinion about the incident.</p>
<p>Hawkins had on hot but simple makeup that completely accentuated her features. She also wore large dangling earrings and a low necked dress. However, what struck her fans the most was how young she looked in the selfie.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, fans soon speculated that she had gotten fillers while others concluded that she went under the knife for cosmetic surgery. Whether or not the speculations are correct, Hawkins continues to remain at the top of her game.</p>
<p>The grandmother of two has successfully joined the ranks of celebrity mothers who have still got it going. On the list are actress Taraji Henson, socialite Kris Jenner, and many others.</p>
<p>Besides being a glam Hollywood mama, Hawkins never fails to look out for her son. Over the years, Brown has been at the center of several controversies and drama due to his erratic behavior.</p>
<p>In an interview in 2011, Hawkins opened up to discuss his past and her support for him. She revealed that despite his grave mistakes, he was still a human being and he needed to own them and move on with his life.</p>
<p>After Brown&rsquo;s home got robbed in 2015, the concerned mother voiced her opinion about the incident. She implied that one of his friends was responsible in a social media post. It was unsurprising because she always spoke about how much she disliked his friends.

Chris Brown captured a candid photo of his son, Aeko looking quite shocked while playing with his colorful shoes.</p>
<p>After being away from his only son, Aeko due to the cross-border restrictions in America, Chris Brown is finally reunited with his youngest child amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Go Crazy&rdquo; artist recently shared a photo of his mini-me looking at the camera with a serious yet surprised face while playing with a pair of little sneakers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mood,&rdquo; the proud dad captioned the post. Brown also shared his son&rsquo;s photo on his Instagram stories but this time Aeko was standing with his hand clenched into a fist while rocking an all-gray ensemble.</p>
<p>Aeko&rsquo;s life has been documented on social media by both his parents, allowing the world to have a glimpse of his milestones. His mom, Ammika Harris shared adorable photos and videos of Aeko from when he was only an infant, up until his first walk.</p>
<p>In her Instagram stories, Harris featured her only child standing up in the living room and making his first steps towards a drawing board which she moved away from him.</p>
<p>Brown shared a sweet family photo with Harris and Aeko sitting on a bench in what seems to be an outdoor park.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the pop star was not there to witness his son&rsquo;s first strides. Brown could not travel to Germany where Harris and Aeko were due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The father and son were only able to reunite recently when Brown traveled to the UK. In fact, the &ldquo;With You&rdquo; artist was spotted in London carrying his son after a night out with Harris and Rita Ora.</p>
<p>The singer wore a black thermal jacket, jeans, and a yellow cap in the captured photos. Following the preventive measures against the virus in London, Brown also wore a black face mask.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Grammy Award-winning artist was banned from the UK after an arrest for assaulting his former partner, Rihanna. He faced charges then and is now allowed foot in the country.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Brown shared a sweet family photo with Harris and Aeko sitting on a bench in what seemed to be an outdoor park. The father-of-two was casual in jeans and a jacket while his ex rocked a red coat and black leather pants.</p>
<p>Both parents were in masks but from the looks on their faces, they were having one of the best moments this year while enjoying the company of their little bundle of joy.

<h3 id="chris-browns-mom-joyce-hawkins-fits-her-curves-into-a-sheer-black-dress--high-heels-photo">&ldquo;Chris Brown&rsquo;s Mom Joyce Hawkins Fits Her Curves into a Sheer Black Dress &amp; High-Heels (Photo)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.amomama.com/d77d15b55a9eb22f881f18100a6d37e6.jpg?width=650&amp;height=340" alt="img">
Joyce Hawkins, the mother of famous American singer-songwriter Chris Brown showed off her fit figure in a sheer black dress as seen in a recent picture on her Instagram feed.</p>
<p>In a recent post on her Instagram feed, Joyce Hawkins, mother of American singer Chris Brown, gave the world a great view of her trim figure in a sheer black dress.</p>
<p>The photo earned Hawkins several praises from her fans as they could not get enough of her elite sense of style, especially since her age-defying looks have been a constant topic of discussion.</p>

<p>In the picture, Hawkins was standing in her cream-colored living room clad in a sweeping see-through black dress with no sleeves. Her trim legs were on full display as the gown had a slit that went all the way up her thighs.</p>
<p>She had her luscious dark curls packed up into a messy bun and completed the look with a stylish pair of white glasses and a designer handbag. Beneath the picture, Hawkins captioned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;ITS SATURDAY AND IM OUT!!! ♥️.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the years, Hawkins&rsquo; remarkable sense of style and youthfulness has placed her among the ranks of celebrity moms who still have it going. She has made it clear to her fans that age would not stop her from being her best self.</p>
<p>Among the many celebrity mothers on the list are American model Nicole Murphy, rapper Lil Yachty&rsquo;s mother, Venita McCollum, socialite Jordyn Woods mother, Elizabeth Woods, and business mogul Kris Jenner.</p>
<p>Many listeners felt Brown was colorist when he rapped that he only liked black girls with nice hair.</p>
<p>Besides being up to date with the world of fashion, Hawkins has also successfully played the mother&rsquo;s role and kept an eye out for her son, Brown. Through the thick and thin of his career, she has always been a pillar of support.</p>
<p>During his time in rehab, the grandmother of two never failed to show her son how much she loved him as she stood by him through the rough patch. After he completed his three months of anger management rehab, the singer expressed his profound gratitude.</p>
<p>When the singer dropped his hit album, &ldquo;Indigo,&rdquo; last year, several controversies sprung up about a particular song&rsquo;s lyrics on the tracklist. Many listeners felt Brown was colorist when he rapped that he only liked Black girls with nice hair.</p>
<p>Despite all the backlash he received, Hawkins stood up for her son with a post on her Instagram feed. She opined that people were just blowing the whole thing out of proportion, and she felt it was just ridiculous.</p>
<p>Though the singer has had to fight to keep himself out of the bad light, he is undoubtedly a grateful father. Last December, he welcomed his second child, Aoki Brown, with his recent ex, Ammika Harris.</p>
<p>Brown has also had his fair share of Hollywood relationships as he used to date singer Rihanna. Earlier this year, when she spoke about her desire to have kids, Brown opined in a recent interview that he felt she would make a wonderful mother.
