<h3 id="donning-a-new-avatar-kannada-actress-anusha">&ldquo;Donning a new avatar; Kannada actress Anusha&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2019/09/28/220985-1.jpg" alt="img">
Anusha Hegde became a household name in two Telugu States as Mansi in the Telugu show &lsquo;Ninne Pelladatha&rsquo;. The Kannada lass since then has wooed the audience with her looks and performance. Currently, Anusha is seen in the serial &lsquo;Suryakantham&rsquo; on Zee Telugu.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Mangalore, Anusha informs that pursuing acting as a career was never on cards. She was preparing to write Civils and become an IPS officer. Anusha had also completed a year of training for the exams. She shares that an editor of a Kannada TV show checked Anusha&rsquo;s Instagram profile. He liked her pictures and shared with the director of the serial. A few days later she got a call for an audition and after that, there was no looking back for this petite girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a classical dancer. I have completed my MA in Bharatanatyam. I was doing choreography for serials and was getting opportunities to work in serials, however, I wanted to complete my education. I was not interested to get into the field of acting as I was preparing for my Civils. Due to an accident, I could not clear my exam as I fractured my hand. I got a call from a producer for an audition later I came to know that someone recommended to him after stumbling upon my social media profile. I was not attending the audition initially as I have no background in acting, however, my family and friends encouraged me and I attended the audition and I am here now,&rdquo; she shares.</p>
<p>About her stint in Telugu TV industry, she says: &ldquo;As I gained popularity for my works in the Kannada industry; Prabhu sir from Annapurna Studios called me for a new project titled &lsquo;Ninne Pelladatha&rsquo;. I was not ready for it as I was doing Kannada serials. I received a call from him again. So, I wanted to give a shot and I auditioned for the role and got selected. I worked in &lsquo;Ninne Pelladatha&rsquo; for eight months and I had to quit because of health issues. After seven or eight months I got a call from the same channel for &lsquo;Suryakantham&rsquo;, where I am playing the role of a boy named Surya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was tensed as it was a boy&rsquo;s character as it is difficult to play the role of a boy when you are a girl. Every person in the serial supported me; I had to learn how to ride a bike. I was doubtful if I could play this character, but still, I manage to do my best. To portray a boy is tough as I am girlish and a sensitive person. I was scared to play the role as I was not sure if the audience would accept me for my character. After two to three shoots I portrayed the role accurately. My parents and my friends have been a huge support for me. My friends, who are boys also helped me to get the right posture, mannerism, etc, to fit into the character. It was difficult for a week, but I have managed to push through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does Anusha regret not becoming an IPS officer? &ldquo;I did…in the beginning. I was interested in social service and I was fixed to study for Civil. My mother does a lot of social services and I was influenced by her. I realised that being an actress also I could contribute to society by doing social activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anusha says that she wants to start dance academy. &ldquo;I started dancing from the age of three and I still practice it. So, in the near future I will be starting a dance academy,&rdquo; she signs off.

Telugu television shall soon witness a new daily soap. Unlike the routine, the lead lady is happy-go-lucky, kind, gutsy with her attitude on her sleeve. She is the head of her family and doesn’t mind kicking out a prospective groom, whom she disapproves of. And Suryakantham ’s mother is indeed proud of her.As per the latest update, Suryakantham is all set to premiere in July. The show is an official remake of the Tamil serial Sathya that was launched in March, 2019. And Anusha Hegde plays the titular role of Suryakantham in the show. While Sathya features Ayesha and Vishnu Kumar in the leads.Sathya is about the tomboyish girl named Sathya. Under unexpected circumstances, she gets married to a guy who is quite opposite to her. Though he finds it difficult to accept her, he eventually falls in love with Sathya and helps her achieve her goals.The promo of the show that surfaced online recently introduces Suryakantham to us. While a few fans appreciated the channel for a refreshing plot line, a few others criticized the makers for not roping in Ayesha for the role. However, further details of the cast and telecast are expected very soon.Interestingly, Sathya is the Tamil remake of Bengali serial Bokul Kotha which is indeed a remake of Odiya serial Sindhura Bindhu. It remains to be seen how the new daily soap fares on the TRP charts.
