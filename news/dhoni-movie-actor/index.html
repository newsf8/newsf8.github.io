<p>The actor&rsquo;s domestic help informed the police which arrived at his residence and started an initial investigation. His body was taken for autopsy. Manoj Sharma, the additional commissioner of police, Western Region, told PTI, &ldquo;He has committed suicide at his residence in Bandra. Our team is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sources from the Bandra Police said on the basis of primary information, a case of accidental death report will be registered. No suicide note was found from the spot, they said.</p>
<p>Sushant is widely known for his work as the protagonist in the biopic based on former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Directed by Neeraj Pandey, the biopic titled &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo; was released in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant was joined by actors Disha Patani and Kiara Advani in the lead roles. Shushant was praised by the critics, as well as fans, for brilliantly essaying the character of the two-time World Cup-winning Indian captain. The movie traced the journey of Dhoni from a boy in Ranchi to the biggest name in the world of cricket.</p>

<p>Shushant&rsquo;s last Bollywood film was &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo; which was directed by Dangal-fame Nitesh Tiwari. Chhichhore was a multi-starer movie.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took to his Twitter handle to offer his condolences to the family of the actor. Meanwhile, people have also started gathering outside his family&rsquo;s residence in Patna.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput&hellip;a bright young actor gone too soon. He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>The last social media post shared by the actor, who hailed from Patna, was dedicated to his mother, who passed away in 2002 when he was a teenager.</p>

<p>Earlier last week, Rajput&rsquo;s ex-manager, Disha Salian committed suicide by jumping off a building in Mumbai. Disha jumped off the 14th floor of a building in Malad, Mumbai. She was rushed to a hospital in Borivali where she was declared dead.</p>
<p>It is being said that the rising star of the Hindi film industry was going through stress and depression. His last Instagram post on June 3 was highlighting his pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops. Unending dreams carving an arc of smile. &ldquo;And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; read the Instagram post shared on June 3 with his mother&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>An engineering dropout, Rajput was inclined towards dancing when he was a student at Delhi Technological University. He soon enrolled in choreographer Shiamak Davar&rsquo;s dance classes and later joined acting guru Barry John&rsquo;s classes. He also performed as a background dancer in the song &ldquo;Dhoom again&rdquo; with Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the 2006 film &ldquo;Dhoom 2&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Very very sad to hear about this. RIP #sushantsinghrajput https://t.co/28BiK4Li0l — David Warner (@davidwarner31) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>People from the film industry, as well as the sportspersons, took to their social media handles to express their shock and dismay.</p>
<p>Shocked to learn that super talented actor #SushantSinghRajput is no more.He was from my city Patna. Remember meeting him in Rashtrapati Bhawan during oath taking ceremony last year. He had told me that his family lived in Rajiv Nagar,Patna. He had miles to go. He left too soon. — Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; director Tiwari said he had spoken to Rajput last week. &ldquo;I had to call people to confirm. It&rsquo;s so shocking and unfortunately true. I am at a loss for words. I spoke to him last week over messages. We would text each other on and off. Now, this is what I get to hear. He was like a younger brother to me,&rdquo; Tiwari told PTI.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted, &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan also expressed his shock and wrote on his Twitter handle, &ldquo;He loved me so much&hellip;I will miss him so much. His energy, enthusiasm and his full happy smile. May Allah bless his soul and my condolences to his near and dear ones. This is extremely sad&hellip;.and so shocking!!&rdquo;

<p>MS Dhoni: The Untold Story was released back in 2016. During an interview with Bollywood Hungama during the course of promotion of the biopic, Disha Patani was asked by the interviewer to rate some of the Indian cricketers based on their &lsquo;hotness quotient&rsquo;. Players like Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja were mentioned to the actress. Much to the surprise of her fans, Disha Patani rated Dhoni 10/10, while the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja received an 8 rating. Indian skipper Virat Kohli received a great score of 9 from the actor.</p>

<p>Disha Patani was also asked about her perfect date with an Indian cricketer. In no time, she mentioned the now married Virat Kohli as the ideal cricketer she would go on a date with. Patani is thought to be an avid cricket lover, which was visible in another of her several interviews. She was asked about the biggest match-winner in Indian cricket. And she didn&rsquo;t disappoint with her witty response, snubbing the likes of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli and picking Jasprit Bumrah instead.</p>

<p>During the promotional interview for her movie Malang earlier this year, Disha Patani claimed that Jasprit Bumrah was one of the finest cricketers that the country has. She also hoped of a magical performance from the bowler against New Zealand on February 2, which India did win by seven runs. Bumrah picked three wickets in that match while conceding 12 runs in four overs.</p>
<p>Disha Patani is said to feature in several movies this year. The Malang actress has been roped in for Ek Villain 2 and Radhe. But the shooting of the two projects have been on a halt due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने अपने करियर की शुरुआत 2008 में आए टीवी सीरियल ‘किस देश में है मेरा दिल’ से की थी। फाइल फोटो</p>
<p>साल 2020 बॉलीवुड के लिए अब तक शुभ नहीं रहा है। ऋषि कपूर, इरफान खान, संगीतकार वाजिद अली खान, चिरंजीवी सरजा की मौत के बाद रविवार यानी 14 जून को एक और बुरी खबर आई। सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने बांद्रा स्थित अपने घर पर फांसी लगाकर जान दे दी। उनकी आत्महत्या की वजह अब तक सामने नहीं आई है। पुलिस को सुशांत के नौकर ने उनकी आत्महत्या की जानकारी दी है।</p>
<p>कुछ दिन पहले ही उनके पूर्व मैनेजर की मौत हो गई थी। तब वह काफी भावुक हो गए थे। उन्होंने तब इंस्टाग्राम पर पोस्ट किया था, ‘यह बेहद दुखद खबर है। मैं दिशा के परिवार और दोस्तों के प्रति संवेदना व्यक्त करता हूं। भगवान दिशा की आत्मा को शांति प्रदान करे।’ कौन जानता था कुछ दिन बाद वह भी इस दुनिया को छोड़कर चले जाएंगे।</p>
<p>सुशांत ने अपने करियर की शुरुआत 2008 में आए टीवी सीरियल ‘किस देश में है मेरा दिल’ से की थी। हालांकि, सीरियल ‘पवित्र रिश्ता ने उन्हें टीवी इंडस्ट्री में पहचान दिलाई। सुशांत ने बॉलीवुड में एंट्री 2013 में आई ‘कोई पो चे’ से की थी। उसी साल वह शुद्ध देसी रोमांस में भी नजर आए। आमिर खान की 2014 में आई पीके में भी उन्होंने अभिनय किया था। पीके में वह सरफराज यूसुफ के किरदार में थे। 2015 में आई डिटेक्टिव ब्योमकेश बक्शी में उन्होंने लीड रोल निभाया।</p>
<p>हालांकि, बॉलीवुड में उनको भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम के पूर्व कप्तान महेंद्र सिंह धोनी की बॉयोपिक ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’ नई पहचान मिली। यह उनके करियर की सबसे बड़ी हिट फिल्म साबित हुई। उन्होंने सार्वजनिक तौर पर भी स्वीकार किया था कि इस फिल्म से उनका फिल्मी करियर काफी बूस्ट हुआ। महेंद्र सिंह धोनी ने भी फिल्म के प्रमोशन के दौरान बताया था कि धोनी की भूमिका निभाने में सुशांत ने उनसे बहुत सी चीजें जानीं। सुशांत अक्सर कुछ न कुछ पूछा करते थे।</p>
<p>सुशांत ने फिल्मी पर्दे पर धोनी बनने के लिए कड़ी मेहनत की थी। धोनी की चाल से लेकर बाल तक। बोलने के लहजे से बल्लेबाजी शैली तक, सुशांत ने सब कुछ आत्मसात कर लिया था। सुशांत ने कहा था, ‘मंजिल से ज्यादा यात्रा मायने रखती है। धोनी और मेरे ख्यालों में यही एक चीज सामान्य थी। फिल्म की शूटिंग शुरू करने के बाद मुझे इसका अहसास हुआ। मेरा कोई लक्ष्य नहीं है। मैं खुद को गंभीरता से नहीं लेता।’</p>
<p>सुशांत महेंद्र सिंह धोनी की तरह कार और बाइक के भी काफी शौकीन थे। उनके पास बीएमडब्ल्यू K1300R बाइक थी। 170 बीएचपी पावर जनरेट करने वाली इस बाइक की कीमत करीब 25 लाख रुपए है। इसके अलावा उनके कार कलेक्शन में मसेराटी क्वाट्रोपोर्टो (कीमत 1.5 करोड़) जैसी लग्जरी कार भी शामिल है।</p>
<p>सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने एक इंटरव्यू में बताया था कि करियर के शुरुआती दिनों में उन्हें एक प्ले के 250 रुपए मिलते थे। बाद में सीरियल में काम मिलने के बाद उन्होंने मुंबई के मलाड स्थित 2 बीएचके फ्लैट खरीदा। फिर 2015 में पाली हिल में एक पेंटहाउस खरीदा। इसके लिए उन्होंने तब 20 करोड़ रुपए कीमत चुकाई थी।</p>
