We are being told about the need to practice social distancing with other humans, but here&rsquo;s a reminder to practice it with the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Deion Broxton, a reporter with KTVM, the NBC affiliate in Butte, Montana, shared this clip of himself Wednesday in which he realizes a herd of bison were heading his way while doing a story at Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>There was a herd of bison walking right toward me at @YellowstoneNPS today! pic.twitter.com/sdrBvojpwF ‚Äî Deion Broxton KTVM (@DeionNBCMT) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a herd of bison walking right toward me at @YellowstoneNPS today!&rdquo; he captioned the video.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God. Oh, my God,&rdquo; Broxton says in the clip as he looks off-camera with a nervous eye roll before he quickly walks away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I ain&rsquo;t messing with you,&rdquo; he says as he walks out of the frame. &ldquo;Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I&rsquo;m not messing with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Broxton then posted a video of the bison he saw, once he was safely removed from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the video of the bison I shot once I got a safe distance away lol,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>The Twitterverse couldn&rsquo;t help but have some fun with the moment, poking fun at Broxton&rsquo;s eye roll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I see someone cough in the grocery store,&rdquo; one person wrote along with a clip of the reporter, in reference to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Another person was inspired to write poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roses are red Violets are blue Oh my god oh noooo I‚Äôm not mess w u,&rdquo; the poem read.</p>
<p>Someone else chimed in to capture the scene ‚Äî and Broxton&rsquo;s reaction ‚Äî in all its glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are what America needed right now. God bless you, sir,&rdquo; another person commented, along with a GIF of Chris Evans as Captain America.</p>
<p>Broxton&rsquo;s reaction may have caused some chuckles, but it&rsquo;s a good reminder of the dangers posed by bison.</p>
<p>Last July, a 9-year-old girl was tossed in the air by one at Yellowstone. That same month, a 17-year-old was gored by a bison in North Dakota.</p>
<p>In August, Yellowstone officials had strong words when a man pet one of the animals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe individual who recently was captured on video touching a wild bison along a park boardwalk showed an incredible lack of judgment and common sense,‚Äù Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said at the time. ‚ÄúNot only did he put himself and others at risk, he violated regulations designed to keep these animals wild. We expect better from our visitors.‚Äù</p>
<p>The park was also the site of a bison stampeding a car in August. A Utah woman was also attacked by one of the animals last September at Antelope Island State Park, just three months after her date during that excursion was gored in the same location.</p>
<p>The National Park Service tweeted a reminder Wednesday about the importance of not getting too close to wildlife.</p>
<p>Social distancing means avoiding large gatherings and maintaining distance (6 ft) from others. While we&rsquo;re at it, remember to keep it at least 300 ft for larger wildlife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Social distancing means avoiding large gatherings and maintaining distance (6 ft) from others. While we&rsquo;re at it, remember to keep it at least 300 ft for larger wildlife,&rdquo; the park wrote.

<h3 id="bison-trails-announces-support-for-solana-protocol">Bison Trails Announces Support For Solana Protocol</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy82MWM1Y2RiNTRlZGU4YjM2Mzc1NGFmN2NkMDVkMDA3Zi5qcGc=.jpg" alt="img">
Blockchain infrastructure-as-a-service company and Libra association member, Bison Trails, announced support for Solana on March 26. Solana is an open-source project that implements permissionless blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Solana‚Äôs protocol uses a new approach to establish the order of blocks, called Proof-of-History, and will be available at mainnet launch on the Bison Trails platform.</p>
<p>As the company details, Solana currently supports 50-65K transactions per second and 400ms block times, with 50 nodes on its public testnet.</p>
<p>Benefits attached to the partnership</p>
<p>In dialogue with Cointelegraph, Joe Lallouz, CEO of Bison Trails, commented on the benefits of the feature:</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a Solana token holder, you can run your own validators or delegate to the Bison Trails validator at mainnet launch. As additional features like archiver clients and storage rent come online, Bison Trails customers will be able to run additional infrastructure to support the network and earn participatory rewards.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lallouz says that Bison Trails has been working with Solana for over a year, from running one of the first nodes in all testnets, to deploying infrastructure on both physical hardware and in the cloud.</p>
<p>Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana‚Äôs founder and CEO, stated the following:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt Solana, we‚Äôre developing a scaling solution for blockchains that can uniquely capitalize on improvements in hardware and bandwidth. Because of this approach, the upfront and on-going resources required to participate as a validator in the Solana network can be more demanding than other protocols.‚Äù</p>
<p>New projects ahead for 2020</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Bison Trails CEO told Cointelegraph that they will be opening the platform out of limited beta to a wider market. They announced a new network roadmap which includes: Cardano, Celo, Coda, ETH 2.0, Keep, Libra, Near, NuCypher, Oasis, Polkadot, Skale, and TON.</p>
<p>Lallouz also said that the funding round completed in Q4 2019 will allow them to grow as a team to seek new opportunities through new partnerships with exchanges.
