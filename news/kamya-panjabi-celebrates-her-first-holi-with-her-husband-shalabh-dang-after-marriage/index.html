The festival of colours, Holi brings back the zillions memories from our childhood. It was no less than war as our one wrong step can make us the target of a water balloon fight. It was a perfect time to gang up and create a team with the best shooters and planners, who would leave no chance to drench the enemy with water balloons, colours and pichkari. Ahh, those were the best days. But it is the first first Holi celebrated with our 'better-half' that holds a special place in our heart. And television actress, Kamya Panjabi turned a kid as she enjoyed her first Holi after marriage with her husband, Shalabh Dang.

On February 10, 2020, Kamya and Shalabh had united as a couple as they had taken the seven vows in front of the holy fire. On February 13, 2020, Kamya had shared a liplock picture with hubby, Shalabh from their wedding. Along with it, she had written, "So here is my fav one from the party. @shalabhdang", followed by a heart emoji.

In a post-marriage interview with the Bombay Times, Kamya had talked about her wedding and how she danced her heart out at her own wedding reception. She had shared, "I wanted my marriage to be an intimate affair with only our families and close friends in attendance, besides it was held in a gurdwara. However, I also wanted to celebrate the new beginnings of my life with all those who matter to me and so, I hosted a reception (which took place last night). I didn’t want it to be a typical affair where the newly-weds stand on stage and meet and greet the guests. I wanted to be as involved as possible and dance to my heart’s content."

Kamya had further talked about her honeymoon plans and had said that they haven't decided on any destination as they are still caught up with post-wedding rituals. She was quoted as saying, "We haven’t zeroed in on a destination, as we are still caught up with the wedding and post-wedding rituals. It will happen in March."
