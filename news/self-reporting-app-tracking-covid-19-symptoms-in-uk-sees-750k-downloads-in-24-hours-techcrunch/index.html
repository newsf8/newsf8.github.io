One of the big challenges (among many) with the coronavirus pandemic is that overwhelmed health services do not always know how best to deploy the limited resources they have to meet the demand of people falling ill with COVID-19. For example, we know that more ventilators and beds will be needed, but where specifically are the outbreaks happening and how can those local areas be served better?</p>
<p>Now, an app in the U.K. called the C-19 COVID Symptom Tracker, developed out of an unlikely corner of medical research — looking into the progression of medical conditions by tracking twins — is asking people to self-report their symptoms in an effort to start to gather more of that detail.</p>
<p>In line with how the public is trying to step up its efforts to get involved in the fight to contain the disease (some 405,000 people have also volunteered to help the NHS deliver medicine and other supplies to quarantined people, and help people home from the hospital) the Covid-19 app has itself gone viral, with 750,000 downloads since being launched on Tuesday morning. The app now is the third most popular app overall in the UK on the Apple App Store, and the number-one in the medical category, according to figures from App Annie.</p>
<p>Developed by a startup called Zoe in partnership with researchers at Kings College Hospital in London, the plan is to bring the app next to the U.S., where the latter group had already been working with colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford on a previous project (more on that below).</p>
<p>To be very clear, the app itself is not a diagnostic tool — these are being developed on a national level, linking people through to local services. Nor is it designed to give the public any clarity on where COVID-19 symptoms are cropping up. (As we reported earlier, there are a number of those being built and used already, too, providing maps and other data.)</p>
<p>Instead, it’s a research app designed to bring together information that could be useful to medical professionals to better plan their responses.</p>
<p>At first, the plan was to build an app to figure out where there were clusters of cases in order to better determine where testing kits, in short supply, might be better allocated.</p>
<p>“We were actively speaking to a multitude of companies that are making or have testing kits, and originally the idea was that if we identified people who were expressing symptoms, maybe we could get a testing kit to them faster,” said Sara Gordon, a spokesperson for the company. That proved to be too difficult, she added, because the testing arena is very fragmented and so it’s not clear whether they all reliably and consistently work the same (and work well).</p>
<p>Then, attention turned to where the data could be useful, and providing support to the NHS, the U.K.’s National Health Service, in determining the shape and evolution of the virus, in order to research it better and figure out how to deploy NHS resources, was where the team landed.</p>
<p>The ExCel conference center in the Docklands in East London is being set up as a field hospital now, “but there are many other places that will need hospitals opened,” she said, “and this could help figure out where.”</p>
<p>The app has a somewhat unlikely origin. It was created by Zoe, a spin-out from Kings College Hospital that is now backed by some $27 million in funding — investors include Daphni in France and Accomplice (formerly Atlas Venture) in Boston, among others — in partnership with a research group at Kings College that has been tracking twins.</p>
<p>“We’re a healthcare startup that has been running the world’s largest nutrition study,” Gordon said, spanning some 25 years (predating the startup materialising or getting spun out) and 8,000 groups of twins, and covering not just people through Kings, but also Stanford and Mass General.</p>
<p>Researching food intake as well as blood and stool samples, the idea was to “understand everything about how genes determine how we metabolise food, our immune responses, and more,” using twins with nearly identical DNA to do this, and using that input to determine new insights into cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other chronic conditions.</p>
<p>Last week, Zoe’s co-founder, Tim Spector, who is also Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London and director of the Twins UK study, spoke to the Zoe team about creating an app to reach out to the 8,000 twins in the study (who had already been using Zoe to track other parts of their lifestyles) to see how many of them were expressing signs of the novel coronavirus. It could have been a useful test pool also for determining what role age plays in this, as the long-term study means many of the people involved are older.</p>
<p>Events overtook those plans, too:</p>
<p>“From the conversations we were having with Kings” — the inner-city hospital (which happens to be my local hospital) has been very much at the front lines of the coronavirus response in London and the U.K. — “we decided that if we’re making this available to twins, maybe we should open it up to more people,” Gordon said. “One of the main issues here in the U.K. and other countries has been that governments haven’t been able to get good enough data about where the virus is spreading or how bad symptoms are.”</p>
<p>There are some major caveats with the app, which it seems are still a work in progress.</p>
<p>The biggest of these is that the app itself is self-reporting. That means that you are putting a lot of trust into people to be accurate and also consistent with each other in how they are describing their symptoms. (Is my idea of a continuous, unproductive cough the same as yours? And are our coughs even a reliable enough indicator of what is going on?)</p>
<p>“We’re relying on the public to be honest about their symptoms,” Gordon said more than once during my conversation with her. That would have been one reason too why tying the surveys to testing kits (the original idea) might have been problematic: so many people want some assurance that I’m guessing a lot would have reported just to get the kits.</p>
<p>The other is that it requires regular, habitual use: a person reporting one day is only really useful if that person reports for the rest of the days subsequent to that to get a picture of how and if symptoms progress. On the other hand, that could be a boost to self-reporting too: even if my version of a continuous cough is different from yours, at least I’ll now be showing how and if anything else gets added to that cough over time.</p>
<p>“What we’re trying to do is scale what we see and what scientists are classifying as severity of symptoms,” she said. “If someone has fever over a certain period, then that’s logged as red. Amber is feeling ill.”</p>
<p>Over the next few days she said the team is hoping to separate COVID-19 symptoms apart from those associated with a common cold. “We’re working to make sure that in reporting we’re being able to divide which are common cold or flu and which are COVID-19.”</p>
<p>A third issue is the data usage on the app. The privacy terms on Zoe note that the data is only there to be used by the researchers, but it also notes that it could travel outside of the EU not just for analytics but to be shared with other research partners.</p>
<p>Indeed, privacy experts and others are still debating the implications of how crowdsourced services like this one, built quickly for the crisis, are really walking a grey line when it comes to questions of privacy and data protection. For now, Zoe defends its position.</p>
<p>“The data policy we have is the one we have had legal advice on,” Gordon said. “It’s compliant with GDPR, and if and when we pass to others, people’s names are anonymised and switched to code. We feel we have super-strict data rules on our side.” She added that the compliance in the U.S. is even more strict because any research they do there has to go through a clinical process to make sure it is protected, “so there should be absolutely no concerns about data privacy.”</p>
<p>All the same, even with all the best intentions, there could also be a risk of your data getting misappropriated when handed off from one party to another and no longer under local jurisdictions.</p>
<p>That skepticism is possibly not helped by the fact that the co-founder and CEO of Zoe, Jonathan Wolf, is the former chief product officer of Criteo, the adtech company that happens to be getting investigated by France’s data protection watchdog for how it uses personal data (Wolf left the firm in 2016 before co-founding Zoe in 2017). Criteo is described simply as a “machine learning company” — no mention of advertising — in Wolf’s bio on the Zoe site.</p>
<p>(The third co-founder is George Hadjigeorgiou, who also doesn’t have any direct links to the medical industry, having been the CEO of HouseTrip and the co-founder of efood, a delivery startup.)</p>
<p>On a more positive note — and there is a lot to see that is positive here — Zoe itself is a business, but this project specifically was built without that in mind.</p>
<p>“Building this to meet the current need was just a decision we made,” Gordon said. “The team switched from the commercial product to this for the next few weeks, and the plan is to make it open source and to hand it off to the right people eventually. We just want to get the ball rolling.”</p>
<p>Remember to stay two meters apart from others when you go out, and stay at home when you can. Keep well, TC readers.

<h3 id="coronavirus-tracking-app-aims-for-one-million-downloads">Coronavirus: Tracking app aims for one million downloads</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1E0B/production/_111419670_zoe-app.jpg" alt="img">
Image caption The app is available on Apple&rsquo;s app store and Google Play</p>
<p>An app that tracks the symptoms of Covid-19 in the UK has become one of the most popular downloads.</p>
<p>Its creators aim to deliver insights into why some people get the disease more severely than others.</p>
<p>They also hope to create a map showing where outbreaks are happening and help distinguish cases from those of the common cold.</p>
<p>It is one of many such new apps. Experts have warned people to be cautious about which they download.</p>
<p>At present, Covid Symptom Tracker is the third most popular app in Apple&rsquo;s UK store and second in Google Play&rsquo;s new releases chart for the country.</p>
<p>Its developers are targeting one million downloads in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The program has been shared thousands of times via WhatsApp and other social-media platforms.</p>
<p>Created in just three days by researchers at Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; hospitals and King&rsquo;s College London university, in conjunction with the nutrition advice start-up Zoe, it has already reached 750,000 downloads and, according to its developers, is being installed at a rate of 50,000 times an hour.</p>
<p>Home-testing kit</p>
<p>The app was the brainchild of Prof Tim Spector, a genetic epidemiologist at King&rsquo;s College, who has specialised in the genetics and medical histories of twins for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was rather depressed as they were shutting down everything in the university and I thought that twins are the best studied people in the country, so how can we use that information in this crisis?&rdquo; he told BBC News.</p>
<p>Initially, the app was made available only to the twins taking part in his studies, who were sent a home-testing kit to better understand which symptoms corresponded to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But the professor realised it could be scaled up to the general public, without the testing element.</p>
<p>Temperature reading</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NHS hasn&rsquo;t come up with a better alternative and this app seems to be working,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are hoping to get to one million downloads by the end of the day and we will also be ready to release data by then for the NHS, data modellers and researchers to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The software requires users to share personal details, including their age, height and medical history.</p>
<p>It then asks them to describe symptoms, if they have any, on a daily basis, as well as to give a temperature reading.</p>
<p>Critically unwell</p>
<p>Prof Spector said it could potentially help the NHS:</p>
<p>learn how fast the virus is spreading in a particular area, as well as highlighting high-risk parts of the country</p>
<p>better understand the symptoms, including the differences between those of the virus and the common cold</p>
<p>explain why some people develop a mild illness while others become critically unwell</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Zoe told BBC News all shared data would be anonymised and not used for any commercial purpose. And users could delete all their records when the crisis was over.</p>
<p>But as spam and malware skyrocket on the back of the pandemic, one expert said people would be wise to be cautious about downloading other apps purporting to help tackle coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am concerned by the rash of websites and apps intended to allow people to report of their Covid-19 symptoms,&rdquo; said privacy expert Pat Walshe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dubious ethics&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it difficult or impossible to determine who is behind a number of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not adopt appropriate standards of compliance with data protection law and I see dubious ethics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could an app help? Yes, possibly. But I think we need the NHS to coordinate it in order to provide confidence, trust and protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Spector agrees people need to be careful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are lots of scams out there and bogus things trying to get your details,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>People wishing to download the Covid-19 tracker can do so from Apple and Google&rsquo;s app stores.

<p>READ MORE Police to interview victims through WINDOWS due to coronavirus Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College, is leading the work. He said: “The concept is that it is an early warning radar device because we are asking about non-classical symptoms as well, because many people are reporting non-persistent cough, or feeling unwell or a strange feeling of a lack of taste, or chest tightness that aren’t in the classical list but if we see it across the country in clusters we know they are probably real [symptoms of Covid-19], “Speaking to clinicians in the hospital, especially in the elderly you get very different symptoms to the young so this idea there is only two types of symptoms – fever and long-term cough – is wrong. “It can occur in many different ways,”</p>
