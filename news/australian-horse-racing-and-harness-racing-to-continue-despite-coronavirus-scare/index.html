Racing, including greyhound racing, is one of last organised sports still operating after shutdown rules put in place</p>
<p>Horse racing and harness racing will resume after a coronavirus scare, with the industry saying they will continue operating unless explicitly prohibited by health advice.</p>
<p>Racing, including greyhound racing, is one of the last organised sports still operating in Australia after shutdown rules – including the banning of mass gatherings, interstate border restrictions and recommendations against non-essential travel were put in place this week.</p>
<p>The NRL indefinitely suspended its season on Monday, the A-League on Tuesday and the AFL last Sunday due to coronavirus shutdowns. The Tokyo Olympics have been postponed to 2021.</p>

<p>On Friday, Harness Racing Victoria announced it would resume racing on Saturday after a steward with Harness Racing New South Wales, who officiated a race meeting attended by a number of drivers and trainers from Victoria, returned a negative test result for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Flat racing in Victoria resumed on Friday after Melbourne jockey Mark Zahra, who caught a flight 15 days ago with a person later diagnosed with Covid-19, also tested negative. Two NSW jockeys who had contact with Zahra also tested negative.</p>
<p>Zahra himself is scheduled to ride again in Bendigo on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Racing Victoria chief executive, Giles Thompson, said Zahra’s negative test “paves the way for racing to resume in Victoria tomorrow and for this we are extremely grateful”.</p>
<p>“We are acutely aware of the incredible hardship that many Australians are facing at this time through the loss of their jobs, which is why we are continuing to work so hard to protect the livelihoods of all those within Victorian racing who depend on it,” he said.</p>
<p>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to announce stage three lockdowns on Friday and has repeatedly said that people who can stay home must stay home. Andrews previously indicated shutdowns could be expanded to include everything that is not an essential service. Yet the Victorian government has declined to comment on whether racing should shut down.</p>
<p>Thompson said horse racing supports 25,000 direct and indirect jobs in Victoria alone. According to the Australian Skills and Industry Committee, about 11,400 people are employed directly in horse and dog racing in Australia.</p>
<p>Unlike other sports, racing has animal care requirements which cannot be shut down.</p>
<p>“In announcing the resumption of racing, I want to assure the Victorian community that racing will continue to operate under strict biosecurity protocols and where required act decisively, as we did when suspending racing yesterday, should there be any risk to the health of our industry stakeholders and the wider community,” Thompson said.</p>
<p>From midnight on Friday, people involved in the racing industry who cross state borders will have to stay away from a racetrack for 14 days afterwards. Horses will be allowed to cross state borders only with licensed transport companies, and providing no one involved in transport enters a racecourse.</p>
<p>Harness racing will resume on Saturday, and the Harness Racing Victoria chief executive, Dayle Brown, said he was “comfortable with the processes employed by [Harness Racing NSW] to investigate this situation”.</p>
<p>Greyhound racing in Australia will continue until organisers receive health advice telling them to shut down, a spokesman for Greyhound Racing Victoria told Guardian Australia.</p>
<p>The spokesman said there were 1,200 meets a year, with the calendar set 12-month in advance, and participants would stick to that.</p>
<p>Berejiklian urged to close NSW border after Queenslanders continue to visit state&rsquo;s north Read more</p>
<p>“We continue to race with our distancing policy in place unless advised otherwise,” he said.</p>
<p>All three industries have been racing without trackside crowds, reduced the number of people on course to “essential” personnel, and put social distancing rules in place intended to stop person-to-person contact.</p>
<p>Members of the horse racing industry have raised animal welfare concerns if meets are suspended, saying that horses need to be fed and exercised, even if the meets are not running.</p>
<p>The RSPCA has called on the federal government to declare work that involves caring for animals, including in the racing industries, as essential, to exclude it from any potential lockdowns. It has not called for racing to be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>“This includes if and when these facilities are no longer open to the public,” RSCPA chief executive Richard Mussell said. “There could be disastrous consequences for human health and welfare as well as animal health and welfare, if people are unable to care for, and are forced to abandon, the animals that depend on them for survival.”

<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/27/622379.jpg" alt="img">
BANGKOK (The Nation/ANN): Following the deaths of 30 horses in the Northeast region on Thursday (March 26), the Department of Livestock Development conducted an investigation and learned that the horses had had fevers, snots and breathing difficulties, but no signs of Covid-19 infection.</p>
<p>The animals also presented subconjunctival haemorrhage, fatigue and swollen faces which are symptoms of the African horse disease.</p>
<p>The department ordered horse farm owners to quarantine them to prevent the disease from spreading and confirmed that it poses no danger to humans. - The Nation/Asia News Network

<h3 id="horse-racing-doesnt-get-betting-windfall-amid-covid-19-sports-shutdowns">Horse racing doesn’t get betting windfall amid COVID-19 sports shutdowns</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/884dd44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6289x3302+0+445/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2Feb%2Fbb51f0d549e98857547430dabf1e%2Fla-photos-1staff-506898-sp-santa-anita-covid19-gxc-0099.JPG" alt="img">
As legalized ways of gambling have almost come to a stop, horse racing remains the only sport still open for business. Despite that unique position, it hasn’t led to a surge in popularity or revenue to the few tracks still operating.</p>
<p>The tracks that are still running &ndash; Santa Anita and Los Alamitos are among the four in California &ndash; are closed to the general public and open only to the most essential people. In fact, conducting a race card requires far fewer people than when horses have to get out of their stalls every morning if to do no more than jog or gallop.</p>
<p>Santa Anita gets about a third of its pari-mutuel business either on-track or through state inter-track wagering, sometimes called OTBs. However, the lack of other tracks running or no team sports to bet has shifted only about 10% to 20% of new revenue back to the mutuel handle.</p>
<p>This past Saturday and Sunday, Santa Anita had $13.2 million bet on its races. In a comparable weekend in February, there was $18 million bet, $6.4 million of that either on-track or through state inter-track wagering.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Other date comparisons this year showed the same trends, although figures vary day to day based on the number of races and horses that are entered. Last year around this time, Santa Anita was closed because of an increase in horse fatalities.</p>
<p>“No one really thought this would be a great windfall,” said Craig Fravel, chief executive for racing at the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields. “I think anybody who is looking at it from that standpoint is missing the big picture. What we’re trying to do is sustain the ecosystem in a responsible manner. … We want to make sure people are following all the protocols while giving them an opportunity to pay their bills.”</p>
<p>The Stronach Group is donating 100% of its profits during this time to people impacted by COVID-19.</p>

<p>If racing in California were to stop, the owners, trainers and jockeys would have to look to a jurisdiction that is running. Moving between tracks on the East Coast is easier because of geography. If people were to leave California they might never come back and the industry could collapse in the state.</p>
<p>The territories running are getting fewer. Racing is currently halted at Aqueduct in New York, Laurel in Maryland and Fair Grounds in Louisiana. However, racing continues at Gulfstream and Tampa Bay in Florida, Oaklawn in Arkansas and two Northern California tracks, Golden Gate Fields and Cal Expo, the latter of which is only harness racing track running in the country.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen any evidence that there is an amazing explosion of sports betting going to horse racing as of now,” said Alex Waldrop, chief executive of the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn. “But if we can continue to be responsible and race, we may start to draw some of those players who had been betting other sports.”</p>
<p>Racing has continued at Santa Anita without fans on hand. (David McNew / Getty Images)</p>
<p>As for the sport’s economic fuel, wagering, it’s estimated that as much as 90% is done online through advance-deposit wagering (ADWs). Money bet through an ADW while at the track counts as on-track handle, which explains why the math doesn’t always add up. And with at least 20 states having stay-at-home orders, it’s why so much money can still be bet.</p>
<p>“Horse racing is better off than other forms of gaming,” said Kip Levin, president of FanDuel and chief executive of TVG, the horse racing television channel. “Our new customers [to TVG’s online betting service] are up substantially. I don’t know if they are people who were betting retail at the tracks or OTBs or new overall. It’s too early to tell.”</p>
<p>The same is true at NYRA Bets, the ADW that is run out of the New York Racing Assn.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“We have seen an increase in new bettors, but we’re positive they are not big bettors,” said Tony Allevato, president of NYRA Bets. “A significant number are $2 bettors.”</p>
<p>There is also an increase of horse racing on television. Fox Sports partnered with NYRA to put on 15 hours of live race programming last weekend. NBC has an agreement with TVG to also provide programming. Both of those shows would contain racing from California.</p>
<p>The racing calendar remains a moving target. This is currently the time the last major prep races for the Kentucky Derby would be run. Last Saturday, Fair Grounds ran the Louisiana Derby and then canceled the rest of its meeting.</p>
<p>Saturday will be the Florida Derby at Gulfstream, and the following Saturday the Santa Anita Derby is scheduled to be run. Next Saturday would normally have the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland and Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, but both have been postponed.</p>
<p>The Arkansas Derby has moved to the first Saturday in May — a date reserved for the Kentucky Derby, which had to be moved to the first Saturday in September.
