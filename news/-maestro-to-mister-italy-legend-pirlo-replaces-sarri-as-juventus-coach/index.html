<p>Former Italy and Juventus star Andrea Pirlo was appointed the Italian champions&rsquo; new coach, just hours after Maurizio Sarri&rsquo;s sacking with the club promising a &ldquo;new chapter in world football&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sarri, 61, leaves Juventus after just one season, a day after the Italian giants crashed out of the Champions League in the last 16 to French club Lyon.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old Pirlo, with no previous top-level coaching experience, recently took over the Juventus U23 side and arrives on a two-year contract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The choice is based on the belief that Pirlo has what it takes to lead from his debut on the bench, an expert and talented squad to pursue new successes,&rdquo; Juventus said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, begins a new chapter of his career in the world of football: from Maestro to Mister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarri took over on a three-year contract last summer, after leading Chelsea to a Europa League triumph, but failed to deliver on the promised revolution in style on the pitch.</p>
<p>Pirlo&rsquo;s swift appointment, a day after their Champions League exit, is again a bold choice for club president Andrea Agnelli.</p>
<p>Other former players have turned to coaching such as Zinedine Zidane, Frank Lampard and Gennaro Gattuso, but Pirlo does so without experience.</p>
<p>The former midfielder does, however, know Juventus and its players well after an impressive four-year spell from 2011 to 2015.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirlo has had a legendary career as a player. In his four years at the centre of the Juventus midfield, he won as many league titles, a Coppa Italia and two Italian Super Cups,&rdquo; Juventus said.</p>
<p>He also won two Champions Leagues and two league titles with AC Milan.</p>
<p>Former Napoli boss Sarri paid for Juventus&rsquo;s failure to advance in a tournament they have won twice, but not since 1996.</p>
<p>Juventus also lost the Italian Cup and Italian SuperCup finals this season, and finished just one point ahead of Inter Milan to win a ninth &lsquo;Scudetto&rsquo; in a row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Champions League, it was a dream before, now it&rsquo;s a goal and going out like this is disappointing for us, for the players and for the fans,&rdquo; said Agnelli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a cold and lucid analysis, knowing that in a few weeks we will start from scratch and we will have to do it with the same enthusiasm and desire to win.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;I have to call you Mister?&rsquo; -</li>
</ul>
<p>Pirlo began his playing career at his hometown team Brescia in 1995 and went on to play for Inter, AC Milan and Juve before moving in 2015 for two seasons with New York City FC in the MLS.</p>
<p>Capped 116 times for Italy, he was a key figure in the team that won the 2006 World Cup.</p>
<p>Since the end of his playing career in 2017 Pirlo has been discreet in the world of football, mainly working as a television pundit.</p>
<p>But his lack of enthusiasm and often jaded air, have made him a popular figure on the internet with the slogan &lsquo;Pirlo is not impressed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>At Juventus, Pirlo will now find himself coaching some of his former teammates such as Juventus goalkeeper Giangluigi Buffon, a year older at 42.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now I have to call you Mister!?!?! Good luck for this new challenge Andrea!,&rdquo; wrote Buffon on Twitter.</p>
<p>He will also have to manage five-time Ballon d&rsquo;Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, the club&rsquo;s 100-million-euro ($115 million) signing two years ago.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old scored a double on Friday night but could not lift his ailing side into the Champions League quarter-finals in his native Portugal.</p>

Andrea Pirlo has been appointed as Juventus’ new manager on a two-year contract.</p>
<p>The Serie A champions sacked Maurizio Sarri on Saturday morning following their Champions League last-16 defeat to Lyon.</p>
<p>Now Pirlo, who became manager of the Juventus Under-23s just last week, is set for a quick promotion.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 3 Pirlo retired from playing three years ago</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 3 He was initially appointed as the Under-23s boss</p>
<p>A statement from the Old Lady read: “Andrea Pirlo is the new Juventus coach.</p>
<p>“41-years-old and born in Flero in the province of Brescia, Pirlo has had a legendary career as a player that has led him to win everything, from the Champions League to the World Cup in 2006.</p>
<p>“In his four years at the centre of the Juventus midfield, Pirlo won as many league titles, a Coppa Italia and two Italian Super Cups.</p>
<p>“Today, begins a new chapter of his career in the world of football, as it was said almost a week ago: from Maestro to Mister.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 3 Italian legend Pirlo won four league titles with Juve</p>
<p>“From today he will be THE coach for people of Juventus, as the club has decided to entrust him with the technical leadership of the First Team, after having already selected him for Juventus Under-23. “Today’s choice is based on the belief that Pirlo has what it takes to lead from his debut on the bench, an expert and talented squad to pursue new successes. “Andrea Pirlo today signed a two-year contract until 30 June 2022.”</p>

<p>Juventus held a press conference last week to announce Pirlo’s appointment to the Under-23s job.</p>
<p>That was set to be his first role in management, but he’s now jumped to the major hotseat without having managed a single game.</p>
<p>Sarri was sacked – despite winning Juve’s ninth consecutive Serie A title – because of defeats in the Champions League, Coppa Italia Final and Italian Supercup.</p>
<p>It’s claimed that Juventus President Andrea Agnell hopes Pirlo can emulate what Zinedine Zidane has achieved at Real Madrid.

Watch Now: Breaking: Juventus Hires Andrea Pirlo As Their New Manager ( 3:49 )</p>
<p>Juventus have sacked manager Maurizio Sarri after Friday&rsquo;s UEFA Champions League elimination, the club announced. It did not take Juve long to find Sarri&rsquo;s replacement. Andrea Pirlo was named the new Juventus manager just hours after Sarri was fired. Pirlo, a 41-year-old Italian legend and World Cup winner, played for Juventus from 2011-15 after a decade of brilliance at AC Milan. He doesn&rsquo;t have any top-level coaching experience but was named the manager of the Juventus U23 team last month.</p>
<p>Juventus earned a 2-1 win over Lyon on Friday in the round of 16 second leg (watch match replay on CBS All Access), but it wasn&rsquo;t enough as it finished 2-2 on aggregate with the French club moving onto the quarterfinals thanks to away goals. Sarri was sacked less than 24 hours after the result.</p>
<p>Sarri arrived at the club from Chelsea before the season in June of 2019 but did not last more than one campaign. He helped the team narrowly win Serie A, but lost the Coppa Italia final to his old club, Napoli. The lack of success in Champions League was the final straw with the board, especially after the €100 million transfer ($118 million) to snatch Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid back in 2018.</p>
<p>Juve struggled toward the end of the season, stumbling to the Italian league crown by one point over Inter Milan. Juve had won just two of eight games entering Friday&rsquo;s match.</p>
<p>Pirlo also played for New York City FC in Major League Soccer from 2015-17.

Reports: Pirlo to be new Juventus coach</p>
<p>By Football Italia staff</p>
<p>There are growing reports Andrea Pirlo will be announced as the new Juventus coach tonight or tomorrow, having sacked Maurizio Sarri.</p>
<p>Sky Sport Italia claim a decision could be made as early as tonight, at most tomorrow morning, a theory shared by the Corriere di Torino and Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p>According to Juventus reporter Gianluca Momblano, Sky Sport Italia, Sportitalia and others, Pirlo was spotted attending a meeting this evening at the Continassa headquarters.</p>
<p>He has no coaching experience and was only presented this week as the manager of the Juventus Under-23 squad, which plays in Serie C – the Italian third division.</p>
<p>However, he was presented in a huge press conference accompanied by President Andrea Agnelli and director Fabio Paratici, who said he would be groomed for a future role in charge of the main team.</p>
<p>It seems the decision has been sped up considerably by the Champions League Round of 16 exit.</p>
<p>Agnelli sees Pirlo as following in the footsteps of Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid, a creative midfielder with great vision of the game who is young enough to immediately connect with the players and be automatically respected by them for his career.</p>
<p>Pirlo won the 2006 World Cup with Italy, numerous Champions League and Serie A titles between Milan and Juventus.</p>
<p>He retired in January 2018 after a spell in MLS with NYCFC, but had played four years for Juventus from 2011 to 2015.</p>
<p>The other candidates to follow Sarri were all very difficult to secure, as Mauricio Pochettino wanted €12m per season wages, while Simone Inzaghi and Zidane were already under contract with Lazio and Real Madrid respectively.</p>
<p>Sarri was also right when he said his future did not depend on the Champions League Round of 16, because the speed of this development suggests the wheels were already in motion and a decision made based on the entire season.</p>

<h3 id="andrea-pirlo-juventus-hires-italy-legend-as-next-manager">&ldquo;Andrea Pirlo: Juventus hires Italy legend as next manager&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTc0MzMxNzAwMzQyNDMzMTI4/andrea-pirlo-juventus-u23-coach.jpg" alt="img">
It was just a week ago that Andrea Pirlo was brought back by Juventus to be the club&rsquo;s under-23 coach. So much for that.</p>
<p>On the same day that the club fired Maurizio Sarri, Juventus tabbed Pirlo to take over as its new manager. Pirlo, an Italy national team and club legend, has no previous managerial experience, and he&rsquo;s signed a two-year deal to lead the Bianconeri through 2022.</p>
<p>Serie A success won&rsquo;t be enough for the club&rsquo;s gamble to be validated, given that it&rsquo;s won nine straight domestic titles, and the last two have been followed by managers hitting the exit. Champions League success is the ultimate goal, and since Cristiano Ronaldo was acquired from Real Madrid two years ago to help Juventus return to Europe&rsquo;s summit, its Champions League performances have ended in a quarterfinal exit under Massimiliano Allegri and a last-16 exit under Sarri.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s choice is based on the belief that Pirlo has what it takes to lead from his debut on the bench, an expert and talented squad to pursue new successes,&rdquo; the club wrote in an unattributed statement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no questioning Pirlo&rsquo;s credentials as a player. The 2006 World Cup champion won six Serie A titles and two Champions League titles as a player, the latter achievement coming as a member of AC Milan. He finished his playing career in MLS with New York City FC alongside Frank Lampard, who now manages Chelsea–and coincidentally also followed Sarri&rsquo;s footsteps after the Italian was let go.</p>
<p>Whether he can replicate his success on the field as a manager on the sideline remains to be seen and is the question everyone in Turin will be asking for the next year. Juventus will surely be hoping he can replicate what Zinedine Zidane did for Real Madrid in jumping to the senior team and finding immediate European success–though Zidane did spend time coaching Real&rsquo;s Castilla team first.

<p>TURIN, Italy (AP) &ndash; World Cup winner Andrea Pirlo was named Juventus&rsquo; new coach on Saturday, hours after Maurizio Sarri was fired.</p>
<p>Pirlo was given a two-year contract, Juventus announced.</p>
<p>Sarri was fired after his first season in charge ended with the team&rsquo;s Champions League exit.</p>
<p>Despite winning the Italian title, Sarri paid the price for the round-of-16 elimination by Lyon on Friday.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, Pirlo had been appointed coach of Juventus&rsquo; under-23 team, which plays in Serie C. But he had not led a game yet in his first coaching job.</p>
<p>Nicknamed &lsquo;&lsquo;the maestro&rsquo;&rsquo; for his passing skills, Pirlo as a player helped Italy win the 2006 World Cup and also won Serie A six times - twice with AC Milan and four times with Juventus. He also won the Champions League twice with Milan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Today begins a new chapter of his career in the world of football, as it was said almost a week ago: from Maestro to Mister,&rsquo;&rsquo; Juventus said of Pirlo. &lsquo;&lsquo;From today he will be THE coach for people of Juventus. &hellip; Today&rsquo;s choice is based on the belief that Pirlo has what it takes to lead from his debut on the bench an expert and talented squad to pursue new successes.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The announcement comes three years after the 41-year-old Pirlo ended his playing career and five years after he left Juventus for New York City FC.</p>
<p>Sarri left Chelsea last year after only one season in charge &ndash; despite winning the Europa League with the London club.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The club would like to thank the coach for having written a new page in Juventus&rsquo; history with the victory of the ninth consecutive championship, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the divisions of Italian football,&rsquo;&rsquo; the team said of Sarri.</p>
<p>While he led Juventus to a record-extending ninth straight Serie A title, the Bianconeri never really adapted to Sarri&rsquo;s quick-passing style and lost four of 12 matches during the restart.</p>
<p>Amid so much dominance domestically, the true test for any Juventus coach comes in the Champions League &ndash; a competition the Turin club has not won since 1996.</p>
<p>Juventus was eliminated on away goals despite securing a 2-1 victory in the rearranged second-leg home match against Lyon.</p>
<p>Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo made no mention of Sarri in a message posted on Instagram after the Juventus announcement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The 2019/20 season is over for us, much later than usual but yet sooner than we expected,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ronaldo said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s time for reflection, time to analyse the ups and downs because critical thinking is the only way to improve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;A huge club such as Juventus must always think like the best in the world, work like the best in the world, so that we can call ourselves one of the best and biggest clubs in the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Winning the Serie A once again in such a difficult year is something that we are very proud of. &hellip; But the fans demand more from us,&rsquo;&rsquo; added Ronaldo, who scored both of Juve&rsquo;s goals against Lyon. &lsquo;&lsquo;May this short vacation break allow us all to make the best decisions for the future and come back stronger and more committed than ever.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next season&rsquo;s Serie A is scheduled to start Sept. 19.</p>
