<p>The number of coronavirus deaths in the UK has jumped by more than 100 in a day for the first time.</p>
<p>The death toll has risen from 475 to 578, health officials have confirmed, with 11,658 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>The latest figures came after Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled an aid programme to help the self-employed.</p>
<p>People across the UK have taken part in a national applause of thanks for NHS workers and carers helping in the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Queen said the UK was &ldquo;enormously thankful&rdquo; for the commitment of all those working in science, health and the emergency and public services.</p>
<p>In a message on Instagram, she said: &ldquo;We are enormously thankful for the expertise and commitment of our scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption UK applauds health workers fighting to battle the coronavirus</p>
<p>Thursday saw a change in the way NHS England and the Department of Health are reporting deaths.</p>
<p>The latest figures are for a 24-hour period, but Wednesday&rsquo;s were not - they were only for eight hours - from 0900 to 1700 on Tuesday 24 March.</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s figures are for a full 24-hour period, from 1700 on Tuesday 24 March to 1700 on Wednesday 25 March.</p>
<p>So Wednesday&rsquo;s rise of 28 reported deaths and the 107 reported deaths on Thursday cannot be directly compared.</p>
<p>Earlier, a senior hospital figure warned that London hospitals are facing a &ldquo;tsunami&rdquo; of coronavirus cases and are beginning to run out of intensive care beds.</p>
<p>Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said while critical care capacity had been expanded hospitals in the capital had seen an &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; in demand.</p>
<p>A third of the UK cases have been diagnosed in the city.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a further development, data collected via the NHS&rsquo;s 111 telephone service is to be mixed with other sources to help predict where ventilators, hospital beds and medical staff will be most in need.</p>
<p>The goal is to help health chiefs model the consequences of moving resources to best tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Ministers are being urged to step up testing for coronavirus, especially among health workers.</p>
<p>Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries was asked on Thursday why the UK did not order testing kits sooner.</p>
<p>She said that &ldquo;this is not an issue of a lack of foresight in planning, it is an unprecedented event&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dr Harries added that &ldquo;it is a brand new virus, so even to understand how you might test it you need to have the virus and understand a little bit about it before you can start&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope?</p>
<p>It was just a brief moment in the daily press briefing, but deputy chief medical officer for England Dr Jenny Harries did offer some positive news.</p>
<p>She said the coronavirus outbreak was &ldquo;starting to move in the right direction&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Other countries who have been on a steep curve have seen the number of new cases rise by a third every day.</p>
<p>But the UK trajectory is nowhere near that steep.</p>
<p>Five days ago 1,000 new cases were reported. On Thursday 2,000 were.</p>
<p>That may seem alarming, but if we had been on a steep upwards path today&rsquo;s figures would have been twice as high. It suggests some of the early social distancing measures taken before the lockdown have maybe started to have an impact.</p>
<p>We should be cautious. It is only a few days' worth of data - and Dr Harries was clear we must not take &ldquo;our foot off the pedal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Announcing his help for the self-employed, the chancellor said the steps the government had taken so far were &ldquo;making a difference&rdquo; but it was right to go further &ldquo;in the economic fight against the coronavirus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>Police have been given new powers to arrest people who break coronavirus lockdown</p>
<p>The government is facing a backlash from MPs for not joining an EU scheme to get extra ventilators during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Clarence House said Prince Charles was &ldquo;enormously touched&rdquo; by the hundreds of get-well messages he received following his positive test for coronavirus</p>
<p>Kensington Palace tweeted a short video of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis joining with many others around the UK in clapping as a tribute to frontline healthcare staff who are battling coronavirus</p>
<p>The UK has become the largest contributor to the international coalition to find a coronavirus vaccine after donating £210m in new aid funding, Downing Street said</p>
<p>About 170 Britons stranded in Peru have returned to the UK on the first government-chartered flight</p>
<p>Number 10 insists the government is on course to test 10,000 people a day by the end of the week, despite testing just 6,643 on Wednesday</p>
<p>The government extends its target for volunteers to help the NHS to 750,000, after an &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; 560,000 people signed up since Tuesday, Downing Street says</p>
<p>In the US, the Senate has passed a $2tn (£1.7tn) disaster aid bill which includes $1,200 for most adults

THE UK coronavirus death toll hit 422 as a study claimed up to HALF the population may have caught the killer bug.</p>
<p>Deaths jumped by 87 in just 24 hours on Tuesday - the biggest daily increase yet - with the youngest victim killed by the virus aged just 33.</p>

<p>The number of cases across the UK climbed by 1,427 from 6,650 - hitting 8,077 in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust was one of the worst hit, recording 21 deaths in a day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a study by researchers at the University of Oxford claimed up to 50 per cent of the UK population may have already contracted the coronavirus.</p>
<p>It suggests the disease may have already been prevalent in the UK up to two months before the first case was officially diagnosed.</p>
<p>Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford, led the study and says the UK must now increase testing to discover the true stage of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need immediately to begin large-scale serological surveys - antibody testing - to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in now,’&rdquo; he told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>However, the research presents a very different view of the epidemic to the modelling at Imperial College London, which has strongly influenced government policy.</p>
<p>It comes at Health Secretary Matt Hancock today called for an army of 250,000 volunteers to join the coronavirus frontline.</p>
<p>LOCKDOWN</p>
<p>Mr Hancock also confirmed that a new hospital called the Nightingale Hospital with capacity for 4,000 people will open next week at the Excel Centre in east London after being set up with the help of the military.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr Hancock said that home is now the &ldquo;front line&rdquo; in the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>Authorities have also ordered 3.5million tests that will determine if a patient has already recovered from coronavirus and is able to return to work.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson last night ordered a mass lockdown - closing all non-essential shops, banning gatherings of more than two people and insisting families stay behind closed doors.</p>
<p>All travel on roads, trains and buses was also banned unless it’s essential to get to work.</p>
<p>Brits were also ordered not to meet up with friends and to go out to buy food or to exercise just once a day.</p>
<p>Anyone who flouts the new crackdown will face fines of up to £1,000 or even arrest when cops are given emergency powers.</p>
<p>The draconian measures which will change every aspect of Brits' lives included:</p>
<p>In a special broadcast on all main TV channels , the PM branded coronavirus “the biggest threat this country has faced for decades”.</p>
<p>Online shopping and deliveries are continuing despite the lockdown of non-essential UK shops.</p>

<h3 id="west-midlands-emerges-as-a-hotspot-for-coronavirus-deaths">West Midlands emerges as a hotspot for coronavirus deaths</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c236c3d665a56d8b5b352b5682a0f2516bc406b/74_0_3082_1850/master/3082.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=3acf76d0be48e3d7ba33c464c5618913" alt="img">
The West Midlands has seen another sharp rise in the number of coronavirus-related deaths after emerging as a hotspot for transmissions of the virus earlier this week.</p>
<p>Of the 115 new deaths reported across the UK in the latest update, 40 were recorded in the West Midlands. That took the total number of deaths across the Midlands to 112.</p>
<p>Eighteen people who died were being treated by the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust, which has recorded the highest death toll from the virus for any trust in the UK for the second time.</p>
<p>There have been 17 deaths in Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, 16 in University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust and 11 in the Dudley Group NHS foundation trust so far.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the government said it was investigating the reasons behind a hotspot emerging in the region. Anecdotal evidence suggested people’s religious convictions and fears of social isolation could be leading to a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus transmissions in the area.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Guardian, the Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said older Muslim and Sikh people in the area were struggling to adhere to government guidelines about physical distancing because of their religious convictions.</p>
<p>Despite most religious services being cancelled, some older people were allegedly continuing to attend mosques and gurdwaras to pray, Mahmood said. Another theory suggested panic buying in supermarkets, with people queueing next to each other for hours to pay for their goods, could be contributing to the large cluster.</p>
<p>Who is dying from coronavirus and in which NHS trusts? Read more</p>
<p>While NHS England reported 107 new deaths across 30 trusts on Thursday, some of those deaths had reportedly occurred as early as 16 March. The youngest of the new patients was 32 and had an underlying health condition.</p>
<p>The figures emerged amid continuing confusion over the number of virus-related deaths after NHS England changed how the data was reported and it emerged that people dying at home of suspected cases were not included.</p>
<p>NHS England said it was shifting the time period for the daily reporting of deaths because hospitals under pressure were struggling to gather the data in time.</p>
<p>It revealed that 107 people died from coronavirus in England, taking the UK-wide figure to 115 over a 24-hour period – the highest daily toll so far.</p>
<p>NHS England also belatedly revealed that the unexpectedly low figure of 28 deaths on Tuesday covered only a short period, from 9am to 5pm, dashing hopes that the UK’s curve was flattening.</p>
<p>In future, there will be a time lag of almost a day in reporting deaths, which will be published at 2pm and reflect mortality figures for the 24-hour period before 5pm the previous day.</p>
<p>The figures include age brackets showing the range of people who have died.</p>
<p>However, some prominent cases do not appear to be reflected in the figures, such as that of Kayla Williams, a 36-year-old mother from Peckham, who died just before paramedics arrived and was recorded by them as a possible Covid-19 case.</p>
<p>Chloe Middleton, the 21-year-old from Buckinghamshire whose family said on Wednesday she died after contracting coronavirus, also does not appear to be recorded in the figures.</p>
<p>An NHS England source said the likely cause of people missing from the statistics is that the daily figures only include those who tested positive in hospital.</p>
<p>The UK is only testing people for coronavirus in hospital, so people dying at home or in care homes with symptoms of the disease will be missing from the overall figures.</p>
<p>The number of omissions are likely to be low at the moment but could increase as the pandemic worsens in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>A Public Health England spokesman said the overall figures published daily represented all those who had tested positive for coronavirus, and there was no systemic testing of those who had died with symptoms but no confirmed diagnosis.</p>
