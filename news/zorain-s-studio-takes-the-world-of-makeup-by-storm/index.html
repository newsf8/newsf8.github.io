<p>“Everyone is born beautiful if you ask their mothers. But we all need a little bit of help from makeup artists,” says Zorain Khaleeli, India’s very own makeup mogul who has 20+ years of industry experience, done makeup for over 6,000 brides and trained over 3,500 students. “Makeup is as much an art, as it is a science, and its effect is no less than magic. It&rsquo;s those hidden small tricks that can amaze your mind and change how you view a person,” elaborates Zorain, celebrated makeup artist who has been a part of over 12 seasons of the Indian Fashion Week, India&rsquo;s most premium fashion week. She has also been a regular behind the curtains at many other shows that include Couture weeks, Blenders Pride Fashion Weeks etc. where she has worked with the top models in the industry including Noyonika Chatterjee, Carol Gracias, Sanea Sheikh, Nethra Raghuraman, Rachel Bayros to mention a few. “Working with these supermodels and readying them for the ramp prepares you for anything. It is one of the most challenging tasks for makeup artists. There’s always less than required time and more than required pressure. I have thrived and lived to tell the tale,” says Zorain. Zorain has graced with multiple coveted awards, including: ● India Lifestyle Awards for Best Makeup Artist - India 2016● National Choice Award for India&rsquo;s Best Makeup Studio of the year 2017-18● International Quality Awards for Best Makeup School 2018-19● Professional Beauty India Award for Service in Beauty Industry 2018● Times Power Women 2019● Women of Substance 2019 for Beauty Ladies Chapter of India● Indian Salon &amp; Wellness Awards 2019 by Franchise India● MICE Global - Most Fabulous Women Leaders in Wedding Industry - 2020● Times She Unlimited Award Beauty 2019● ASSOCHAM Award - Fastest Growing Make up Academy 2020● Economic Times Power Icon 2020 - Excellence in Makeup Hair Nails and Beauty 2020Zorain has also been part of the celebrated TedxTalks and featured by Vogue India. She has shared her knowledge in multiple stage shows and seminars, which include Professional Beauty India and HBS Style Speak Show. Zorain has also had the opportunity of being a backstage artist at the IIFA Awards, the GIMA Music awards and the 100 years of Kannada film industry celebrations. She has worked with a host of Bollywood A-listers including Siddharth Malhotra, Shraddha Kapoor, Kangana Ranuat, Kriti Sanon, Bipasha Basu, Shruti Hassan, Sunidhi Chauhan, and the ever beautiful, Zeenat Aman. She has also done makeup for top actresses from the Tollywood and Kannada film industries including Ramya, Sharmila Mandre, Andrita, Shruthi Hariharan, Jennifer Kotwal among several others. “Working with film industry people is comparatively relaxed as you get time to do your thing and let your craft do the talking. I wish I could find time to do more films but my studio and academy fully consume my time as it is a part of my larger dream to turn it into India’s largest chain of Premiere Makeup &amp; Beauty Training and Services providers,&quot; says Zorain talking about her dream project - Zorain Studio &amp; Academy. “I have had this vision for a long time, to create a platform for makeup artists, by makeup artists. My goal is to create an exceptional experience for our students and clients, committing ourselves to providing our customers with premium quality and unparalleled services. With Zorain Studio &amp; Academy getting the attention that it deserves, we seem to be getting there,” Zorain says. Fact is, Zorain Studio &amp; Academy is apparently the largest makeup studio and academy in India. It is conveniently located in Domlur, the heart of Bangalore city, and spread across 6000 sq. feet. It is the first digitally equipped training academy that boasts of a Wifi-enabled large training room with 40 stations, a bridal suite, cafeteria, research stations, hair stations and a digital screen for training videos or live demos.It caters to students not only from Bangalore but from all over India and overseas. Students travel to Bangalore from cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Goa, Agra, Punjab, and even from Dubai and Saudi Arabia etc. to train in the international curriculum offered. “We’re focussed on delivering the best to our customers and students both. What we teach is what we do and what we cater products for. Maybe this is the reason for our growing popularity. Our academy has been instrumental in taking the art of technical makeup, hair and nails to the heart of even the Tier-II towns like Dhardwad, Hubli, Bagalkot, Shimoga, Salem etc.” says Zorain, a tinge of pride in her voice. With a large number of in-house and visiting faculty, Zorain’s Studio and Academy offers courses covering multiple aspects of hair and make up, nails and lashes, ensuring an overall and technically detailed development of the trainee. Duration of the courses range from a few hours to a couple of months covering both basic and advanced levels in each stream. Using her knowledge and experience gathered over the years, Zorain and her team of well trained faculty pass on their craft and technical know-how to the next generation of aspiring makeup artists. Some courses also come with credits from international certifying authorities like Manipal City and Guild UK, which is valid in 80 countries worldwide. Zorain’s Studio and Academy also offers the convenience of buying products to help its students achieve whatever they want to.

<p><img src="https://images.edexlive.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/3/6/w600X390/Makeupartist.jpg" alt="img">
Married at 17 to a 32-year-old man, a victim of domestic abuse, this woman did not bow down to societal pressures. She rose from the ashes like a phoenix instead. Born and brought up in a staunch Muslim family, Sekh Ria started living her life when she chose to become a make-up artist and beautician after getting a divorce from her first husband after six years of marriage. Ria was married off right after she completed her Class XI. Even if she had the interest to study further, she wasn&rsquo;t given the chance. &ldquo;Education for girls was not necessary at that point in a Muslim household. We were married off early. But I always wanted to enter this profession, which was considered derogatory in our community,&rdquo; explains Ria, adding, &ldquo;Among the members of our community, girls are not seen in a good light if we get into this field - many of my family members tried to stop me but I was keen on learning. I even sold some of my jewellery to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ria had been inspired by her aunt&rsquo;s daughter, who used to work in a parlour. &ldquo;I saw her and thought to myself that I want to do this, and I was not qualified enough to pursue anything else. Thus began my journey as a make-up artist,&rdquo; says the 28-year-old, who can expertly style your hair, do your make-up and drape your saree for you in just an hour. She&rsquo;s no less than a magician, we say! Before this line of work, Ria aspired to join the Indian Air Force someday but that dream was quashed when she was married at such an early age. &ldquo;My father suffered a stroke when my marriage problems were going on. Then, this job became my livelihood and the only means to help with my father&rsquo;s treatment, so it means everything to me. I wanted to study, I still want to. I have even thought of pursuing some course through distance education but I can&rsquo;t afford it now,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>People appreciate what I do, they say that we beauticians make them beautiful, hide their flaws and that&rsquo;s what feels like an achievement</p>
<p>Sekh Ria, Beautician and makeup artist</p>
<p>Ria remarried in November 2017 and her husband has been her pillar of support throughout. She recalls her earlier days when she worked in parlours for the bare minimum of `1500 because her family had no other means of income. Then, her husband got her into a make-up course to improve her skills. But Ria adds that she has mostly learnt her skills from YouTube tutorials. Her dream is to open her own parlour one day. &ldquo;I have the space but no money to renovate it or buy the equipment yet. There&rsquo;s no one to help me apart from my husband but I don&rsquo;t want to burden him with everything. I wish to save up and do something by next year,&rdquo; she explains. For the hundreds of other girls like her who are less-fortunate and can&rsquo;t afford high-end training at renowned salons, Ria conducts make-up classes for those who want to learn and earn a livelihood.</p>

<h3 id="amphan-diary-a-harrowing-experience-but-humbling-too-writes-actor-rituparna-sengupta">&ldquo;&lsquo;Amphan&rsquo; Diary: A Harrowing Experience But Humbling Too, Writes Actor Rituparna Sengupta&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.outlookindia.com/public/upload_share/magazine/rituparna_sengupta_20200608.jpg" alt="img">
Candle In The Wind</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder why cyclones often have bizarre names. Fani immediately reminds one of a serpent and its deathly fangs. Amphan, pronounced ‘um-pun’, means sky in Thai. As actors, we accept or reject movies on the strength of a script. But why an apparently innocuous name like Amphan—a name that Thailand proposed in 2004—decided to strike a rather laidback and benign city like Calcutta confounds me. Mother Nature probably wanted to test the City of Joy’s limit of perseverance.</p>
<p>The sheer destruction that Amphan has left in its wake is there for all of us to see, but the emotional distress it has caused is unimaginable. The city has lost over 5,000 trees—that’s almost an entire generation gone. It is bound to upset an already tottering ecosystem. Trees are the hallmark of some of Calcutta’s streets. The Southern Avenue, for example, is probably the leafiest road in south Calcutta. It abuts the Dhakuria Lake and the two world-class golf courses—Royal and Tolly—where Calcutta’s lungs reside.</p>
<p>Heart-breaking stories of tragedy abound. Two young men electrocuted by an unseen live wire, the asphalt sheet swept off a village street, a tree slicing a minibus into half on the Golf Green-Howrah route…these vignettes are simply horrifying. When I hear that my manager Sharmistha has been without electricity for five days and paid Rs 180 for two candles, I am aghast. When I hear that my maids, who hail from South 24 Parganas, have lost their huts and their humble belongings have been washed away, my mind goes numb. We are trained to act. We laugh, we cry, we go ecstatic and we can sink to the depths of despair on screen. But I am now caught in a belligerent crossfire of emotions. This script is for real, you don’t need to act. Mother Nature is the ultimate producer and director.</p>
<p>Whom Do I Grieve For?</p>
<p>As an actress, there is no clear definition of ‘family’ for me. My husband, my children, my mother, my mother-in-law, my in-laws…is that all? Not quite. From the spot boy to the technician to the make-up artist, the directors and producers, my co-actors and of course my thousands of fans, they are all family. My extended family is like an ocean and my heart goes out to each one who has suffered from the fury of the cyclone. In our lifetime, Amphan has been the worst natural calamity we have seen. Calcutta was certainly not prepared for it. And coming as it did at a time when millions are suffering from a deadly virus, Calcutta’s back was broken. My profession has taken me across the world but there is nothing like Calcutta. There is life in every leaf, every brick and every whiff of air you inhale. That’s why Calcutta is the City of Joy. I am devastated because the city’s heritage spots have been ruined.</p>
<p>I had recently shot at College Street in North Calcutta for Agnidev Chatterjee’s Jihad with Rohit Roy. We went to the famous Coffee House and used hand-pulled rickshaws in a few scenes. I reckon College Street is the world’s biggest repository of old books. Every shop is unique. It’s a bibliophile’s paradise. To see books floating in dirty water is tragic. Not far from College Street and across the serpentine Central Avenue is Kumartuli. We were shooting here for Sujit Mondal’s Anweshan with Ronojoy Bishnu. It’s the place where artisans mould the clay from the river Hooghly into shapes of the gods we worship round the year. Amphan did not spare many sheds under which the idols of Durga and Kali are made. That leaves me with a question—why did Mother Nature attack artisans who create gods with their own hands?</p>
<p>Calcutta may not keep pace with the glitz and glamour of New York or Singapore, but it’s probably the only city in the world that has learnt to live with its heritage and old charm intact. College Street and Kumartuli are fine examples. I really don’t know if these book shops will ever recover. The clay artists probably will.</p>
<p>College Street, Calcutta, after Cyclone Amphan.</p>
<p>This Night-Bitten Dawn</p>
<p>Sandip Ray’s Nishijapon (After The Night…Dawn) comes close to resembling the devastation Amphan has caused. The 2005 movie was a multi-starrer and I was playing the lead role alongside Soumitra Chatterjee, Dipankar De and Parambrata Chatterjee. It was the story of a dysfunctional family stranded in a forest villa in the mountains for days after a sudden earthquake envelopes the area in darkness. The bridge that connects the house with civilisation is destroyed. Landslides and incessant downpour wreak havoc and as hunger and panic build up, the urge to survive reveals the true nature of every person. People contemplate suicide as well. I think Calcutta is facing something similar. No aid will be enough. The mental destruction will be irreparable.</p>
<p>The Biggest Screenplay</p>
<p>I have twice come close to facing nature’s fury. But one incident that remains vivid in my mind is a flight from Calcutta to Singapore when I was expecting my second child. It was three hours of mayhem in the skies. The aircraft was rocking under the impact of the storm. I have experienced air pockets many times, but this was different. All the passengers were screaming, the flight attendants were terrified, but the pilot kept his cool. I was virtually staring at death and I was more concerned about my baby at that advanced stage of pregnancy. Fortunately, we landed in Singapore in one piece.</p>
<p>But that was only three hours of horror. I can imagine what Calcutta must be going through. The city has looked beautiful in recent years. There has been a lot of work done to improve the civic amenities. Now all that is lost. It will take a lot of time to rebuild Calcutta. It was good to see the Prime Minister conducting an aerial survey. This is the right time to come together—not just for our national leaders, but for the masses too. Religion, caste, class should not divide us. In the eyes of an Amphan or a coronavirus, everyone is equal and only a united front can help salvage the situation. There are at least a dozen movies either on the floor or waiting to be released. But in Amphan, I have seen the biggest screenplay ever. It’s been a harrowing experience but humbling too. It’s time to accept nature’s fury and move on.</p>
<p>(As told to Soumitra Bose)

<p>Social media is flooded with uber talented folks, who can draw on a perfect wing with eyeliner in less than 30 seconds&ndash;both eyes, mind you. But as everything has a flipside, so does this phenomenon. While these guys are upping their game with every new post and tutorial, the effect they’re having on the rest of us is rather aspirational… which isn&rsquo;t always a good thing, contrary to popular belief.</p>
<p>When people who have absolutely no inclination or skill for a certain craft, it’s best they leave it alone&ndash;especially if offering it as a service and monetising it is on their minds. Don’t believe us? Here’s proof.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, there’s been a challenge making its way around YouTube, where beauty bloggers and influencers go to the most poorly rated makeup artists in their vicinity. As of now, there are thousands who have completed the challenge, both here and in the West, and their experiences will make you laugh until you fall off your chair.</p>
<p>Before we go ahead and show you some, we’d just like to add that these influencers have approached this task with anonymity, so as to steer clear from shaming or defaming any place they visit. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Ever wondered how a touch-up can change the final image? All of us seek perfection, especially while presenting ourselves to the outer world.</p>
<p>Getting the perfect bridal look is not a matter of joke. Many end up spending a lot of money over it. However, Fatima Khan, a popular make-up artist from Hyderabad will leave you amazed at the quality of her work and the pricing. She provides glowing and picture-perfect look to thousands of her clients. She was recognised and awarded with the India Lifestyle Award in 2015.</p>
<p>Fatima, who set up her make-up studio in Hyderabad in 2014, has made quite a name for herself. Right attitude, patience and hard work have made her climb the ladder of success very swiftly.</p>
<p>She shares that the idea of becoming a make-up artist was never a planned move and it just dawned upon her on one fine night. She was lucky that she was supported by her husband and in-laws in executing her plan. “I never thought my family would consider make-up artistry as the right career choice. My parents, in-laws and husband had full faith in me and became my strongest pillars of support. I am really thankful to them. It was this love and faith that inspired me to aim for being the best in the field and achieve whatever I have till date. I wish every single woman receives such great support from parents and in-laws to make a life of their own,” says Fatima.</p>
<p>Although she is based out of Hyderabad, Fatima serves clientele from around the world to make them feel special on their D-day. One of her team members from the studio shared, “We trust Fatima’s decision, when it comes to giving the best possible look to each and every person, she caters to. It might be any occasion, skin tone or outfit; she loves to make everyone feel special.”</p>
<p>Another person added, “She started on a small scale but realised that every professional in her team should be an expert in what they offer to the clientele. While someone could be an expert in airbrush makeup another can be the go-to person for eye makeup and yet another can just specialize in HD Makeup. We all knew then itself that this was a great idea and it did work wonders for us. If Fatima trusts her instincts, we trust her.”</p>
<p>Talking about her desire to make every person stand out, Fatima put forth, “Every lady deserves to look her best and especially, on her wedding day. I am here, to make every eye fall on her and every guy present there at the location to think, I wish I would have met her earlier. I don’t give a single chance to any of my clients or be dissatisfied with our work. Our flawless, long-lasting smudge-proof make-up is perfect for brides. We treat our clients as our family members.”</p>
<p>By every single means, Fatima tries to provide her clients with the best and this is the reason why they have reached out to be loved by 47K followers on her Instagram handle. She has reached out to many people through her YouTube channel too.</p>
<p>“For what you desire, is what we offer. For what you believe, is what are we are here for. We might not be your dream but can definitely take you closer to it”, says Fatima.</p>

<p>Updated: Apr 28, 2020 17:45 IST</p>
<p>Make-up is a huge part of most women’s daily routine, women wear make-up to feel confident, express themselves, conceal what they consider to be their flaws, to brighten up their tired faces and sometimes, just because! Make-up is meant to accentuate your features, not change your appearance, skin tone, eyebrows or be excessively caked up. These are all complete no-nos, and such garish make-up should most definitely be avoided. Unfortunately, make-up trends like contouring, drawn on eyebrows, excessive layering, unrealistic eyelashes, extreme use of colours, all these take away from one’s natural features and make you look excessive, and while this may do for a night out on the town or for a special occasion, wearing such heavy-duty make-up on the daily is extremely bad, both for your self esteem and your skin. One should feel as confident bare-faced as one does with make-up, and if bad acne or skin issues prevent you from going bare-faced, then we have the perfect basic make-up routine ideas for you. Russian makeup artist, Julia Ismailova’s client transformations on Instagram will change your outlook on make-up and most definitely your make-up routine. Unlike most dramatic makeovers, where one cannot recognise that the before picture is the same person as the after (thanks to complete complexion changes, contouring and extensions - hair, lash, eyebrow, nail, you name it!), Julia’s approach is more accessible. Not all of us want to have a photoshoot ready face at all times, for most of us a little bit of Kajal and gloss goes a long way, and Julia’s daily make-up makeovers are the perfect solution for those of us who like to keep it simple.</p>
<p>The Russian make-up artist gave a makeover to some of her clients, perfecting their daily make-up routine for them by using simple hacks, professional techniques, while also ensuring she highlights their best features, doesn’t add too many components or make them look older, and showcasing their natural beauty. Here are the before and after photos of her clients, the photos on the left is the make-up done by the clients themselves, and the photos on the right (the after shot) is when Julia, the expert, worked her make-up magic on the ladies. According to the captions (or their translations), Julia’s desire to help girls and use cosmetics correctly drove her to this experimentation, and after the girls have given Julia their inputs and idea about what they want to look like, she incorporates their feedback into the final look. So it’s actually what the girls wish to look like, and not just Julia’s vision.</p>
<p>In on the captions Julia wrote about how women have a skewed perception of their appearance, and the way they describe themselves won’t even resemble the person you see, but despite that Julia managed to give them what they needed, while some wanted an exact look, the others were more than happy to be Julia’s blank canvas. Check them out!</p>
<p>In the caption to this transformation, Julia wrote that she saw her clients eyebrows were drawn in very thick and dark and looked very unrealistic, she also realized that her client had smooth and even skin, which didn’t require the amount of foundation she has on her face, neither the dramatic eyeliner. The after image shows how using minimal makeup, Julia transformed the young girl making her look a lot younger and vibrant.</p>
<p>The Russian makeup artist only changed a few small details such as the shape of the eyebrows, thinner eyeliner and glossy lips for a plumper, younger appearance.</p>
<p>For the quirky young teen, Laiza, Julia wrote, “Laiza is 19 years old. She is incredibly cool. When I got a request from her, I didn’t have a single doubt about whether to work with her or not. We talked about life for a long time and about what makeup means for Laiza in general. I felt that I didn’t want to ‘break’ her and remake her, I understood her message, and I started to work.”</p>
<p>For this post, Julia wrote, “Frankly speaking, there was actually nothing to find fault in: her skin tone was correct and the lipstick was the perfect colour.” She went on to explain that since the wings of the eyeliner were pointing downwards, the client’s eyes looked droopy, however, some soft shading on the upper and lower lids took care of this.</p>
<p>Using some colour correctors, bright make-up and by simply tying the woman’s hair up, Julia took years off the woman’s face and made her look very vibrant. She wrote, “The first thing Elana said when she sat down on my makeup was, ‘I don’t get warm colours’. In her opinion, makeup in cold tones suits her the most, does not emphasize the redness of the skin and makes the face fresh.” She went on to clarify that Elana was only 29-years-old.</p>
<p>The client that Julia refers to as Nastya in her post went through the most transformation, Julia wrote how she likes to see if the girls will change their make-up habits after visiting her, and in Nastya’s case that’s just what happened. Nastya’s dark make-up and flat hair was switched in for light, rosy make-up that made her look younger and voluminous hair that added to dimension to her face.</p>
<p>For 24-year-old Maria pictured above, Julia wrote, “Maria is 24 years old and divorced. The conversation with her revealed that she almost doesn’t wear any makeup now and the ‘before’ pic shows her evening makeup rather than her day makeup. However, 6 months ago, Maria would wear this makeup in the afternoon. My task was to show my vision of what I thought her afternoon look should be.”</p>
<p>This was the first ever daily make-up transformation post that Julia had put up, reminiscing she wrote, “The first transformation that started it all. A lot of people accused me of using PhotoShop, however the video will confirm that I did not.”</p>
<p>Are you a make-up junkie and knew all these tricks? Or will you be using this the next time you put on some?</p>
