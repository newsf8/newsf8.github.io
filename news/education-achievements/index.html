<h3 id="these-pittsford-students-help-show-the-way-for-helping-others">&ldquo;These Pittsford students help show the way for helping others&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/04/PROC/c4a96a77-2e6c-44b3-b564-0fce9cd51ec0-Pittsford_sisters.jpg?crop=1439,810,x0,y432&amp;width=1439&amp;height=810&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Let&rsquo;s admit it: We&rsquo;re all a bit overwhelmed right now.</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis is reaching full boil. The rapidly rising number of infections and deaths becomes a blur with each passing day. And we fear for our loved ones, ourselves and our futures.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is what it felt like to Americans in the darkest days of World War II, well before D-Day, when victory seemed anything but certain</p>
<p>Or maybe we should think of British history. D&amp;C reader Bill Wynne likens our current moment to a key event early in World War II: Dunkirk.</p>
<p>(For those of you reading who don&rsquo;t know what Dunkirk was, please scurry to Wikipedia and look it up. We&rsquo;ll wait for you. Oh, heck, simply watch the movie trailer, whose apt taglines include &ldquo;Hope is a Weapon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Survival is Victory.&quot;)</p>
<p>Wynne&rsquo;s point is that at a dire moment for British forces trapped on a French beach early in World War II, it took action and heroism from soldiers and citizens alike to turn the tide. All that effort in spring 1940 didn&rsquo;t win the war, but it allowed the war to be won five years later.</p>
<p>Whatever historical analogy you prefer, we are clearly at a moment when those on the front lines of the coronavirus battle (doctors, nurses, hospital personnel, nursing home staff, grocery employees, bus drivers and so many others) require the support and assistance of those of us who are essentially civilians.</p>
<p>And while we &ldquo;civilians&rdquo; are mostly holed up in our homes, there is so much we can do to provide assistance. Better yet, I know from the many emails I&rsquo;m receiving that so many of you want to provide assistance.</p>
<p>So today and going forward the D&amp;C is going to help you see how you can step up and step in, with a little help from two sisters in Pittsford.</p>
<p>Coronavirus in Rochester:How you can help, in all different ways</p>
<p>Ways to help:Support the Community Crisis Fund for your neighbors in need</p>
<p>Two sisters promote key public-health message</p>
<p>Katherine Huang is a junior at Pittsford Mendon High School. Her sister Cailey Huang is a seventh-grader at Barker Road Middle School. They reached out to me recently to share something they&rsquo;ve created to help our community weather the coronavirus storm.</p>
<p>Like students from pre-kindergarten all the way up to college and post-graduate studies, the Huang sisters&rsquo; lives have been upended in ways large and small.</p>
<p>Both are swimmers. Katherine has played the flute for the Rochester Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, Cailey the violin for the Hochstein Philharmonia Orchestra. Katherine has been a member of the Pittsford Panthers robotics club, while Cailey has served on her school&rsquo;s Student Council.</p>
<p>You get the picture. Except for their studies, done in the comfort of home these days, almost all of those activities and others are in limbo. The sisters&rsquo; connections with friends are limited to video chat and texting. And learning from home presents unique distractions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to admit, my desk is by the window and I&rsquo;ve noticed all the chubby squirrels in our yard,&rdquo; Katherine told me Thursday. &ldquo;Sometimes I watch them chase each other around the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the while, they&rsquo;d been watching the world they know struggle under the relentless assault of the novel coronavirus. They&rsquo;ve taken particular interest in Gov. Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s daily briefings on the state&rsquo;s response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw he was increasingly targeting young adults with this idea of staying home and helping to flatten the curve with social distancing,&rdquo; Katherine said of the governor. &ldquo;He kept stressing it because this demographic had trouble getting and processing this message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said the sisters still saw people posting on social media about playing on playgrounds or going out in groups. And Katherine and Cailey struggled to reconcile such irresponsible behavior with the growing amounts of suffering and death in our nation and in the world — &ldquo;all those unfortunate stories,&rdquo; Katherine said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they took that feeling of being overwhelmed and turned it into productive action.</p>
<p>Katherine, whose future might include a career in marketing, and Cailey, who has a love of art, saw some of the state&rsquo;s social-media public-safety promotional images and decided to create some themselves &ldquo;to make them more attractive to this audience of young adults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at the designs that were on the governor&rsquo;s web page and they were like really simple with a few colors,&rdquo; Cailey said. &ldquo;I just took those same colors and made them into a different style. I made them more trendy and appealing for younger people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sisters, daughters of Yinbiao and He Huang, shared their handiwork with me, so that I could share it with you. Check out (and share on social media) these COVID-19 public safety announcements they&rsquo;ve created at this online link: bit.ly/Covid19awareness</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how much we miss each other and regardless of how nice it is outside, it is our responsibility to stay at home,&rdquo; Katherine said.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Support the Community Crisis Fund</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, an enormous coordinated effort is under way in greater Rochester to meet the health-care and human-services needs that have snowballed to unimaginable levels since the first local coronavirus case emerged March 12.</p>
<p>It involves Monroe County and city of Rochester and RTS and town officials and state leaders and legislators.</p>
<p>It involves the main nonprofit agencies and foundations in town, especially the United Way of Greater Rochester and the Rochester Area Community Foundation (whose leaders wrote their own column that the D&amp;C is publishing today).</p>
<p>And it involves businesses large and small, each of them showing ingenuity and heart at a time when their bottom line is almost certainly suffering.</p>
<p>For now, it appears best that local citizens support these efforts, along with taking care of yourselves and your loved ones. The scope and scale of the issues greater Rochester and New York state face are such that one-off efforts can be lost amid the need.</p>
<p>It is also important to recognize that nonprofit agencies on the front lines are simply overwhelmed (there&rsquo;s that word again) with activity. This is not a time when they want to be flooded with phone calls or emails, even from well-meaning individuals wishing to help.</p>
<p>So I share with you here the link to make a donation to the Community Crisis Fund: <a href="https://bit.ly/2x678FJ">https://bit.ly/2x678FJ</a></p>
<p>And I share with you here the single-best web page listing volunteer opportunities in Rochester during the crisis: <a href="https://bit.ly/2Rc9Q3a">https://bit.ly/2Rc9Q3a</a></p>
<p>Finally, at the behest of reader Wynne, I share with you a way to assist those suffering in New York City right now through the city&rsquo;s COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund: <a href="https://on.nyc.gov/3aKpaMn">https://on.nyc.gov/3aKpaMn</a></p>
<p>Online D&amp;C article to be regularly updated with ways to help</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve published an article headlined &ldquo;Coronavirus in Rochester: How you can help, in all different ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to update it on weekdays for as long as this crisis lasts. We will rely on the guidance of the United Way and Community Foundation on specific ways the public can assist.</p>
<p>We will publish it in the printed newspaper each Sunday going forward. For print readers who also read us online, here is the URL, which you may bookmark and share with friends: <a href="https://bit.ly/2UHI1lt">https://bit.ly/2UHI1lt</a></p>
<p>Giving and volunteering as the United Way and Community Foundation and local leaders suggest are very real ways each of us can make a difference. Along with, of course, staying at home.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the Huang sisters. Their initial email came to me on a blue day, one where &ldquo;overwhelmed&rdquo; was all too true a description of my mood.</p>
<p>Their efforts, and the heartfelt nature of them, struck a chord with me. Their belief that positive messages can make a difference served as a reminder to me that the D&amp;C has an important role to play connecting our readers with opportunities to help those in need.</p>
<p>Hope is, indeed, a weapon.</p>
<p>I pledge to you this: The D&amp;C team will do its best to serve greater Rochester and each of our readers every single day.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<h3 id="introducing-luci-a-company-that-is-reimagining-modern-mobility-through-smart-technology-for-power-wheelchairs">&ldquo;Introducing LUCI, a Company That is Reimagining Modern Mobility Through Smart Technology for Power Wheelchairs&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20200618005100/en/799208/23/LUCI_Logo_Color_Black_%C2%AE.jpg" alt="img">
NASHVILLE&ndash;(BUSINESS WIRE)&ndash;LUCI, a company that is reimagining modern mobility, today announced the release of its premier product also named LUCI. It is a first-of-its-kind hardware and software platform that uses sensor-fusion technologies to allow a power wheelchair to “see” its environment, giving riders unprecedented stability, security and cloud connectivity.</p>
<p>LUCI mounts onto a power wheelchair between the power base and the seat, to help users avoid collisions and dangerous drop-offs while maintaining personalized driving control. Through cloud-based capabilities, LUCI can also monitor and alert users and caregivers of low battery, possible tipping scenarios, and other important updates regarding the chair and the user.</p>
<p>Tipping over in a wheelchair is a common, treacherous reality, which often leads to trips to the hospital and expensive healthcare bills. In fact, 87 percent of wheelchair users reported at least one tip or fall in the past three years1. Wheelchair accidents were the cause of more than 175,000 ER visits in 2010 &ndash; the last year the data was tracked &ndash; and 30,000 of those were significant enough for admission into the hospital.</p>
<p>“ Wheelchair users were left behind when it comes to most innovative technology,” said Barry Dean, CEO and Founder of LUCI, also a Grammy-nominated songwriter, whose daughter Katherine, 19, has cerebral palsy and has used a wheelchair her whole life.</p>
<p>“ We realized no one else was working on this problem in a meaningful way so my brother Jered (Dean, CTO of LUCI) and I set out to create a solution for Katherine. What started as a labor of love among family members has ultimately created a safer, more stable way for people with disabilities to navigate their world and stay connected to loved ones. Today, we’re excited to launch LUCI and continue collaborating with researchers, universities and other companies using our open platform to move the industry forward together.”</p>
<p>The LUCI team spent the past two and half years collaborating with clinical professionals and logging over 25,000 hours of user testing to develop an invention to help people with physical disabilities drive safely, precisely and independently. LUCI’s R&amp;D efforts have already resulted in a total of 16 patents (eight pending).</p>
<p>&quot; When we started tinkering with my niece Katherine’s chair, we had no idea where this journey would lead,” said Jered Dean, CTO, who has spent two decades in design and systems engineering, most recently serving as director of the Colorado School of Mines’s Capstone Design@Mines program. “ From developing advancements in millimeter-wave radar technology to collaborating with engineering leaders from Intel® RealSense™ Technology Group to maximize the application of some of the world’s smartest cameras, I’m incredibly proud of the unprecedented work our team has accomplished to solve the challenges our customers face.”</p>
<p>&quot; Intel® RealSense™ technology is used to develop products that enrich people&rsquo;s lives by enabling machines and devices to perceive the world in 3D,” said Joel Hagberg, head of product management and marketing, Intel RealSense Group. “ LUCI leverages Intel® RealSense™ to map the world in a low-power, cost-effective way to make drop-off protection and collision avoidance possible, and we’re excited to be a part of this inspirational effort to deliver innovation that improves lives.”</p>
<p>LUCI’s technology combines stereovision, infrared, ultrasonic and radar sensors to offer users these critical features:</p>
<p>Collision avoidance: LUCI is designed to prevent wheelchair users from running into objects (walls, people, pets, furniture, etc.) as they navigate their daily lives. It does this by smoothly helping to navigate the chair in coordination with user steering inputs based on obstacle detection in the driver’s surroundings.</p>

It does this by smoothly helping to navigate the chair in coordination with user steering inputs based on obstacle detection in the driver’s surroundings. Drop-off protection: It doesn’t take a large drop-off to tip a wheelchair (less than three inches in some cases). LUCI helps users avoid tipping by recognizing steps or drop-offs and smoothly helping the chair continue on a safer path.</p>

LUCI helps users avoid tipping by recognizing steps or drop-offs and smoothly helping the chair continue on a safer path. Anti-tipping alert system: LUCI monitors the steepness of a ramp or the ground users are driving on and provides an audible alert if it becomes a tipping danger. In the event that a chair tips over, LUCI sounds an alarm and can be configured to quickly alert other individuals, such as a caregiver or loved one, of the exact location of the rider and the tipped chair.</p>

Cloud-based communications and alerts: The MyLUCI portal allows users to view their data and share it with loved ones or clinicians. LUCI can be set up to alert others of specific events, such as the user’s location if their battery gets dangerously low. LUCI also now works with Hey Google and Amazon Alexa so users can interact with MyLUCI using their voice. MyLUCI portal is available as a mobile app for both iOS and Android™ phones, as well as for desktop with the Web Portal.</p>

Secure health monitoring: LUCI users can choose to share their heart rate data with their team using either Google Fit* or Apple HealthKit from day one.</p>
<p>“ I was blown away by not only the product and the innovative features of LUCI, but just the whole culture and the rider-focused passion that was brought to its unique design,” said Kelly Waugh, PT, MAPT, ATP, clinic coordinator for the Center for Inclusive Design and Engineering at the University of Colorado Denver. “ It&rsquo;s going to be a game changer for a lot of people who use power wheelchairs, but I also think LUCI is going to open up power mobility for people who might not have been candidates before. Most importantly, it will enable power wheelchair riders to go places and do things with greater ease, confidence and safety.”</p>
<p>LUCI is available for purchase in the U.S. for $8,445 MSRP. For more info, visit: <a href="http://www.luci.com">www.luci.com</a>.</p>
<p>About LUCI: Based in Nashville, with R&amp;D headquarters in Denver, LUCI was founded by Barry and Jered Dean, brothers who were driven to innovate from personal experience, and committed to creating change for people living with disabilities.</p>
