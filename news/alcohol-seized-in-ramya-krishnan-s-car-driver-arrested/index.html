<p>Actress Ramya Krishnan is back in news, however, this time around for wrong reasons. Ramya Krishnan made headlines on Saturday after a large number of alcohol bottles were seized from her car It is said that the Police were conducting the regular vehicle check on East Coast Road in Chennai. That’s when actress Ramya Krishnan’s car passed by and was stopped. The cops then found nearly two crates of beer and bottles of hard liquor in the vehicle. The police confiscated the bottles and arrested the driver. The driver was later let off. It is said that Ramya Krishnan was present in the vehicle during the check. She is yet to provide a statement on the above incident. TASMAC shops in Chennai are yet to open and selling and transporting alcohol in the city is illegal and against the rules of lockdown as Chennai is in Red Zone. With the number of Covid-19 cases in Chennai on the rise, there were rumours that there would be another complete lockdown. This resulted in some buying alcohol in the neighbouring Puducherry. However, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had requested people to not believe in such rumours.

I even got to catch with my friends in my hometown,&rdquo; shares &lsquo;Dev&rsquo; as he is fondly referred to as.In a very excited tone, the actor further narrates &ldquo;There was a limited network in my native, so I was kind of away from all news.

Especially when I was in Bangalore. But I motivated myself on the brighter side. Because it was for a good cause,&rdquo; says the actor.Coming back to reality, Devaiah is back on the sets of Jothe Jotheyalli and is currently shooting for the upcoming episodes.&ldquo;Obviously, there is a lot of expectations for the show. Looking at the present scenario, it&rsquo;s more like starting from scratch. It is quite a challenge to meet the expectations of the audience, but our team is ready to dodge it,&rdquo; concludes the actor.
