Amidst the ongoing hullaballoo over the Censor Board, Salman Khan’s much awaited film &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; has been rewarded a U/A certificate with no cuts at all. Not only this, the much speculated teaser of Ranveer Singh and Vaani Kapoor’s ‘Befikre’, directed by Aditya Chopra, will be attached to the film once it’s out this Eid on July 6, 2016. Well, this is surely a double treat this Eid.

<p>Few days ago, the Central Board of Film Certification came under the radar of entire Bollywood fraternity and even the Indian judiciary after it demanded 89 cuts in &lsquo;Udta Punjab&rsquo; and eventually lost the legal battle against the makers in the High Court that ordered the film to be released with just one cut. Now, CBFC is in the news again but this time for the right reasons. Apparently, the Censor Board has passed Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma-starrer &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; without a single cut (yes, you read that right!) and with a U/A Certificate. Wait, it doesn&rsquo;t end here. The CBFC panel that saw the film is said to have been super impressed by the film&rsquo;s content and performances and hence cleared the film immediately without demanding a single cut in the film. Now that for sure is some brilliant news for all Salman fans who have been waiting with bated breath for the film to hit the screens this Eid. Looks like Salman and his fans have already got their Eidi from the Censor Board. On the one hand, while the actor has been heavily criticised for his &lsquo;raped woman&rsquo; comment, on the other, CBFC&rsquo;s decision would give him some respite and a reason to rejoice. Time for some celebrations at the Khan-daan!

<p>Anushka Sharma is currently busy shooting in Budapest for her upcoming movie &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; and like everyone else, the actress too was excited about the episode of &lsquo;Games Of Thrones - The Battle of the Bastards&rsquo;.

<p>Salman Khan has created quite a buzz with his role in his upcoming film, &lsquo;Sultan.&rsquo; While Salman Khan movies are said to be all about peppy numbers and smart one-liners, with his recent films he has broken the stereotype. In an interaction with TOI.com, the director of Sultan, Ali Abbas said, &ldquo;The aim is that audience should find a new Salman Khan in &lsquo;Sultan.&rsquo; The idea is that he can do all this, which lot of people think that Salman Khan movies are all about - dance and songs and everything. I think he already pushed the bracket with &lsquo;Bajrangi Bhaijaan.&rsquo; We hope that when people come out of Sultan they say that there is a new Salman Khan in Sultan.&rdquo; When asked about Anushka&rsquo;s role in the movie, he quipped, &ldquo;The girl in the film is very much like today&rsquo;s girl. She has a point of view about life, she represents the strong segment of Indian women and what Indian women stand for.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Aayushi Sharma <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Salman Khan has created quite a buzz with his role in his upcoming film, &lsquo;Sultan.&rsquo; While Salman Khan movies are said to be all about peppy numbers and smart one-liners, with his recent films he has broken the stereotype.

<p>Rumours of differences between Aamir Khan and Salman Khan have been doing the rounds over the stark similarities between their respective films ‘Dangal’ and ‘Sultan.&rsquo; However, the Khans seem to be unfazed by all the hullabaloo. When Aamir was asked about his wife Kiran Rao finding Salman hot in a langot, Mr Perfectionist said that though she hasn&rsquo;t said that in front of him, but Salman does indeed look hot with and without clothes. Aamir added that Sallu is a gifted guy, who is very handsome and charming, and that they are all very fond of him. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Rumours of differences between Aamir Khan and Salman Khan have been doing the rounds over the stark similarities between their respective films ‘Dangal’ and ‘Sultan.'

<p>That Salman Khan is large-hearted and stands by his family and friends during thick and thin is known to all. The superstar doesn&rsquo;t leave a single opportunity to help and support people who matter to him and ensures that they are doing well in their life and career. And his brother-in-law Aayush Sharma, who got married to Salman&rsquo;s darling sister Arpita, is no exception to this unwritten rule of Khan. While people have been wondering what Aayush does for a living, here&rsquo;s some respite for them. The handsome guy has been working as an Assistant Director on the sets of &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; and no points for guessing who got him on board for the job. However, unlike other ADs who do all the running around on the sets, Aayush is more inclined towards learning the know-how of filmmaking. After all, being family to Bhai comes with its own perks. It seems that Aayush is also seen concentrating more on his looks and fitness, which ADs generally don&rsquo;t get to do. Well, perks you see! Anyways, we hope that the young boy either graduates to be a good filmmaker or gets ready to spread some magic on silver screen with his acting skills.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> That Salman Khan is large-hearted and stands by his family and friends during thick and thin is known to all.

<p>The song &lsquo;Jag ghoomeya&rsquo; from &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; has struck the right chord with the audience and is considered to be one of the finest compositions of Salman Khan&rsquo;s career till date. Those who have seen the song vouch that it can definitely warm the cockles of your heart. However, the song had become popular way before it had even released, thanks to singer Arijit Singh and his public apology on Facebook which gave way to a controversy that left his fans appalled and disappointed. Now, the latest development in the story is that Arijit wants producer Aditya Chopra to act as a mediator between him and Salman. Arijit is said to have spoken to Adi and requested him to intervene and help him mend the bridge with Salman Khan. However, Aditya is in no mood to do that as he fears that it might spoil his association and friendship with Salman. For the uninitiated, Arijit had claimed that he had sung the original version of &lsquo;Jag ghoomeya&rsquo; which was later replaced by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan&rsquo;s version in the film because Salman was mighty upset with Arijit after he allegedly made fun of Salman&rsquo;s hosting at an award show. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, Salman too recorded a version of the song. All we can hope for is this ugly battle to come to an end and Arijit gets a Salman song to add to his repertoire.

<p>If you have seen Salman Khan’s new romantic number, ‘Jag ghoomeya’ from ‘Sultan,’ then you would have probably become a fan of his new move. Salman has shown his new move - rolling on the ground in a circle and then ending up with one foot over the other knee. This move has instantly become a hit. Interestingly, the step has been choreographed by none other than the Bhai himself. Well, this is another one of his trademark moves that we are sure will be copied by his fans.

<p>It seems that the battle between singer Arijit Singh and superstar Salman Khan has taken a rather interesting turn. And the new twist in the story is that Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, who is one of Salman&rsquo;s favourite singers, has recorded his version of the song, &lsquo;Jag ghumiya&rsquo; from &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo;, which Arijit Singh had claimed to have sung earlier. One may recall that Rahat had earlier crooned &lsquo;Teri meri meri teri prem kahaani hai mushkil&rsquo; from Salman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bodyguard&rsquo; and the song went on to become one of Khan&rsquo;s all-time chartbusters. Hence, the chances of Rahat&rsquo;s version of the song, &lsquo;Jag ghumiya&rsquo; is more likely to be retained. But the mystery gets further intriguing as Salman has reportedly sung his version of the same song too; in fact, the actor has recorded his version of all the songs in the film which only producer Aditya Chopra and director Ali Abbas Zafar have heard so far. Hence, the ball lies in their court to decide whether Arijit or Rahat&rsquo;s version of &lsquo;Jag ghumiya&rsquo; will be retained or whether &lsquo;Bhai&rsquo; will have the cake and eat it too. Let&rsquo;s wait and watch! It seems that the battle between singer Arijit Singh and superstar Salman Khan has taken a rather interesting turn.

<p>We all know by now that Salman Khan is leaving no stone unturned for his next action-drama, &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; which sees him as a wrestler on screen for the first time in his 25-year-old career. The actor, who turned 50 last year, is at his fittest best and this new and exclusive still from &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; is a testimony to the fact. The still is nothing less than a visual treat for all Salman fans as the superstar is seen bare-bodied with a rope across his shoulders and the macho Khan is seen pulling a road roller with his shoulders. And do we even need to say how convincingly dynamic the actor looks in the still? The fire in his eyes, the confidence in his body language, his enviable muscles and of course, his chiselled body will surely make a million women go weak in their knees and serious fitness goals to all the men out there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Click on the next slide to know why we are keenly looking forward to &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo;&hellip; We all know by now that Salman Khan is leaving no stone unturned for his next action-drama, &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; which sees him as a wrestler on screen for the first time in his 25-year-old career.

<p>There is an unwritten rule in the industry that nobody says no to Salman Khan. The only two exceptions in the industry have been Kangana Ranaut and Deepika Padukone, who have, at multiple occasions, refused the offers of acting alongside the &lsquo;Dabangg&rsquo; star. However, the person we are talking here about is not a B-town actress, but a veteran filmmaker who held the rights to the title &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him, Salman, director Ali Abbas Zafar and producer Aditya Chopra wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to call their next action drama, &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo;. We don&rsquo;t know what the film would&rsquo;ve been called otherwise, but the fact is that when Salman learnt that producer Ramesh Taurani held the rights to the title, he immediately called and requested him and it didn&rsquo;t take more than a minute for Taurani to give away the title. The report states that Taurani and Salman go back a long way and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Taurani, who bought the music rights of Salman&rsquo;s second film &lsquo;Patthar Ke Phool&rsquo; for Rs 11 lakh, Khan wouldn&rsquo;t have got his signing amount. Taurani considers Salman as a family, so much so that when Adi Chopra decided to pay Taurani for sharing the title, he straightaway refused by saying that this was the least he could do for Salman. Maybe some filmmakers can also take few &lsquo;tips&rsquo; from him on how to honour friendships and &lsquo;being human&rsquo;!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Click on the next slide to know why we are keenly looking forward to &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo;&hellip; There is an unwritten rule in the industry that nobody says no to Salman Khan.

He said that Varun Dhawan reminded him of a younger version of himself! He said, “They (the younger generation) have also grown up watching us. So each one has lots of shades of all of us. You can tell ki kis raah pe jaa rahe hai. I think Varun Dhawan( is like me) because he’s seen me forever now. He added, &ldquo;I think Tiger is very talented, so is Sooraj.

The scene required the handsome hunk to ride a tractor and the above picture proves that he did it in style.

<p>In one of the most bizarre events, a case has been filed in Uttar Pradesh against Salman Khan&rsquo;s next biopic, &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; and the reason behind filing the case is that the filmmakers shot certain sequences in Muzaffarnagar city of UP, but showed the place as Rewari from Rajasthan, and that apparently has upset the local people. Now this case is as bizarre as the plot of the film which was leaked sometime back. There have been umpteen instances in the past when a city has been portrayed as some other place in films and that has been a very regular practice among the filmmakers. And the reason filmmakers do this is not to upset people of the said region, but because it is cost-effective and saves a lot of time that they might otherwise end up wasting in travelling back and forth. Logistically too, shooting a film at a local studio and showing it as some other city works well for the filmmakers. However, Ehtesham Siddiq, who filed the complaint, seems to believe otherwise. Siddiq said that the makers shot certain portions of &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; in Morna of Muzaffarnagar but showed it as Rewari from Rajasthan, and this, according to Siddiq, has annoyed the people of Muzaffarnagar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> While some people are upset with the makers of &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo;, we are keenly looking forward to the film.

<p>Salman Khan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; has been generating the right kind of buzz ever since the film went on floors. The movie stars Salman Khan in the titular role, as a Haryana-based wrestler, a first for the actor. And ever since the makers released the teaser of the film, fans can hardly contain their excitement to catch the movie on the silver screen. At a recently held event, Salman revealed as to why he agreed to star in this sports drama. “The pain of learning, what these people have, which pushes you to the next level, somewhere I don&rsquo;t have that anymore. That is what I want to get back and that is the reason why I signed &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; at 50 and enjoy the pain of learning,&rdquo; he said. &lsquo;Sultan,&rsquo; which also stars Anushka Sharma, is being helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar and is expected to hit screens this Eid.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Click on the next slide to find out why we&rsquo;re keenly looking forward to the film&hellip;.

And ever since the makers released the teaser of the film, fans can hardly contain their excitement to catch the movie on the silver screen. At a recently held event, Salman revealed as to why he agreed to star in this sports drama. “The pain of learning, what these people have, which pushes you to the next level, somewhere I don&rsquo;t have that anymore. That is what I want to get back and that is the reason why I signed &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; at 50 and enjoy the pain of learning,&rdquo; he said. &lsquo;Sultan,&rsquo; which also stars Anushka Sharma, is being helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar and is expected to hit screens this Eid.</p>

<p>In one of the most shocking turn of events, the plot of Salman Khan&rsquo;s next and the most anticipated film &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; is out in the open. As per the latest news in DNA, the basic plot of &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; has been revealed and it sounds as uninteresting as it could get. For the uninitiated, Salman will be seen playing a wrestler in the film, but according to the supposed plot revealed in DNA, Khan&rsquo;s character is shown to be a corrupt government officer who doesn&rsquo;t spare anyone of bribe, but one striking incident and an encounter with a kid changes him from within and he decides to become a wrestler! Bizarre, isn&rsquo;t it? Now why would a corrupt government officer, after a mere encounter with a kid, decide to become a wrestler is beyond us, and I am sure, beyond you all as well. Now let&rsquo;s wait for the trailer to see if these reports prove to be true or mere hogwash.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Meanwhile, we have ample reasons to look forward to &lsquo;Sultan.’ Read on to know what are they&hellip; In one of the most shocking turn of events, the plot of Salman Khan&rsquo;s next and the most anticipated film &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; is out in the open.

<p>Yes, you read that right! An unbelievably huge convoy of 1000 policemen has been deployed for Salman Khan&rsquo;s security during his Muzaffarnagar schedule for &lsquo;Sultan.’ The actor landed in the city on Tuesday night and has been put up at a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city. As per reports in Mid-day, as soon as the news of Salman&rsquo;s arrival spread across the city, an ocean of people gathered to get a glimpse of the actor. The security for the actor is so tight that the main road that leads to the farmhouse has been closed for public and the policemen have been given strict instructions by the CM of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, to neither shake hands with the &lsquo;Dabangg&rsquo; star nor click a picture with him. A special akhada has also been built for the action sequences which are going to be shot during the Muzaffarnagar schedule. In fact, one of the scenes includes Salman indulging in a high octane wrestling sequence while the other scene will see him lifting a tractor. Interestingly, the people of Muzaffarnagar were taken aback to see the boards reading &lsquo;Haryana&rsquo; being put up at many places and were even overheard joking that if they had to show the city as Haryana, they could have shot the film in Haryana itself instead of UP.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Click on the next slide to know how &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo; is similar to Salman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&rsquo;&hellip; Yes, you read that right!

<p>Sometime back, we told you how Salman Khan was slapped hard by Anushka Sharma on the sets of &lsquo;Sultan&rsquo;, albeit in a scene. Apparently, the scene required her to slap her &lsquo;Dabangg&rsquo; co-star hard and it had to look very natural; hence, Anushka, who was initially quite hesitant, had slapped Salman real hard in the scene. Now we hear that while shooting a song sequence, the &lsquo;PK&rsquo; actress gave a spanking to Salman. And we leave it to you to understand where she spanked him! As per a report on BollywoodLife, while shooting the song, &lsquo;Baby ko bass pasand hai,’ Anushka had to spank Salman and the latter had to wriggle it out.

Thankfully, the song sequence went really well and both Salman and Anushka laughed their hearts off after the shoot got over.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Well, we know that this must have increased your intrigue about the film.

<p>Superstar Salman Khan&rsquo;s next action drama &lsquo;Sultan,&rsquo; that sees him in the role of a wrestler for the first time in his two-and-a-half decade long career, is in the news again. Apparently, a song will soon be shot that would feature Salman and it&rsquo;s touted to add another superhit number to Khan&rsquo;s enviable list of chartbusters. While Salman prefers to shoot his films, especially the song sequences outside Mumbai, it comes as a shock that the &lsquo;Dabanng&rsquo; star has decided to shoot this one in Mumbai; the reason being time. Reportedly, the actor is in no mood to waste any time on shooting the song, and travelling outside Mumbai would not only consume a lot of time, but even add up to the film&rsquo;s budget. Also, travelling out of town would be logistically very hectic for the entire team and hence it has been decided that the song will be shot at the famous Film City in Mumbai. We had earlier reported how Salman is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the film&rsquo;s shoot completes on schedule and there is absolutely no delay whatsoever from his end.
