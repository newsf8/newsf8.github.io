<p>T-Mobile appears to be having problems.</p>
<p>Customers are reporting that they can’t make or receive phone calls, although data appears to be unaffected. Some customers say that text messaging is also affected.</p>
<p>DownDetector, which collects outage reports from users, indicates that a major outage is underway. It’s not clear how widespread the issue is, but at the time of writing T-Mobile was trending across the United States on Twitter.</p>
<p>The outage appears to have started around 9-10am PT (12-1pm ET) on Monday.</p>
<p>In our own tests in New York and Seattle, we found that making calls from a T-Mobile phone would fail almost immediately after placing the call. We also found that the cell service on our phones was intermittent, with bars occasionally dropping to zero or losing access to high-speed data.</p>
<p>In April, Sprint and T-Mobile completed its merger, valued at $26 billion, making the combined cell network the third largest carrier in the United States behind AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for T-Mobile also did not immediately comment on the outage, but T-Mobile’s technology chief Neville Ray tweeted:</p>
<p>Our engineers are working to resolve a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to have this fixed shortly. — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Others have reported issues on other networks. When reached, spokespeople for AT&amp;T and Verizon (which owns TechCrunch) said their networks were operating normally. Sprint has not yet responded to a request for comment.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the outage was caused by a cyberattack. Matthew Prince, chief executive at Cloudflare, a global content delivery network, said in a tweet that the company saw no spikes in internet traffic during the outage.</p>
<p>One wire report said Level 3, a major fiber network backbone that cell networks rely on for routing calls and messages, was experiencing an outage, which may have explained the network outages. But a spokesperson for CenturyLink, which owns Level 3, said that there was no current outage on its network.</p>
<p>Widespread cell networks outages are rare but do happen. In 2017, CenturyLink had a network failure that affected all major U.S. carriers and 911 emergency services that rely on the fiber network to route calls. In some U.S. counties, officials sent out emergency alerts to cell phone users to warn that 911 services had been disrupted.</p>
<p>Updated to note that carrier-dependent text messaging also appears to be affected; with AT&amp;T and Verizon responses; with an update from T-Mobile’s chief executive; and with a statement from CenturyLink. An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Neville Ray’s job title.

T-Mobile US Inc. users in several states reported problems making and receiving phone calls Monday, a widespread service disruption for the newly enlarged wireless provider.</p>
<p>The network issues began in the afternoon at T-Mobile, which is taking early steps to integrate its April purchase of Sprint Corp. The transaction left the combined company with more than 100 million customers, including those running atop its infrastructure under other carriers’ brands.</p>

An apparent DDoS attack on the U.S. on Monday caused a handful of social media sites to become inaccessible, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitch. However, the fact that it seems to have also impacted T-Mobile is causing some of the most noteworthy reactions online.</p>
<p>The DDoS attack was confirmed by a handful of tracking sites on Monday and later addressed by the covert online group known as Anonymous. While the source of the attack is still unknown, the group had speculated that China could be involved. The attacks are designed to flood a website or online service with inquiries, overwhelming the system and rendering the site inaccessible, which in this case rendered T-Mobile&rsquo;s cellular network unusable. Neville Ray, T-Mobile&rsquo;s President of Technology, provided updates to customers on Twitter, assuring them that they were working to solve the outage.</p>
<p>Teams continue to work as quickly as possible to fix the voice &amp; messaging problems some are seeing.</p>
<p>Data services are now available &amp; some calls are completing. Alternate services like WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, Facetime etc. are available. Thanks for your patience. https://t.co/uQiGSAFEAH — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>The attack also comes in the middle of an already eventful 2020, which has seen a global pandemic and massive Civil Rights protests. Given the widespread outage, a number of T-Mobile customers do what&rsquo;s often done in scenarios like this: head to Twitter and vent their frustration.

A number of major wireless carriers appear to be dealing with outages Monday afternoon in several parts of the country, according to DownDetector.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — T-Mobile said Monday afternoon that it&rsquo;s working to fix an outage that&rsquo;s impacting its wireless customers around the country.</p>
<p>DownDetector, which tracks user-submitted outage reports, had received more than 100,000 reports from T-Mobile customers by 3 p.m. eastern. It was down to about 24,000 by 6 p.m. eastern</p>
<p>Neville Ray, T-Mobile&rsquo;s President of Technology, said engineers are &ldquo;working to resolve a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to have this fixed shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hardest-hit areas appear to be parts of the East Coast, according to DownDetector&rsquo;s outage map.</p>
<p>Before Ray&rsquo;s tweet, T-Mobile&rsquo;s customer service Twitter account had been responding to customers and asking them for more details through direct message.</p>
<p>A number of other wireless carriers appeared to be experiencing outages on Monday afternoon as well, but on a much smaller scale, according to DownDetector.</p>
<p>DownDetector had reports from Verizon, Sprint, AT&amp;T and US Cellular customers about their issues too. However, each of those carriers had only a few thousand outage reports compared to the tens of thousands of reports related to T-Mobile.</p>
<p>In a statement, Verizon said its network is &ldquo;performing well&rdquo; and accused DownDetector of &ldquo;falsely reporting Verizon network issues.&rdquo;

SALT LAKE CITY — At least two police departments in Utah have responded to a T-Mobile issue affecting customers nationwide.</p>
<p>Via their Twitter accounts, Layton and Provo City police informed their followers of the T-Mobile outages.</p>
<p>T-Mobile users may be unable to dial out, including to 911. If you are unable to call during an emergency using your T-Mobile phone, either locate someone with a phone on another cell carrier or send a Text to 911. Texts to 911 do appear to be going through. pic.twitter.com/7JUm8zAdCm — Layton Police (@laytonpolice) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>T-Mobile is currently experiencing a near-nationwide outage. For those w/ T-Mobile cell phones, you may be experiencing issues placing &amp; receiving calls, &amp; text messages may be affected. If you are trying to reach someone with T-Mobile, the call will most likely not be completed. — Provo City (@provocity) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Layton Police texted residents “that texts to 911 using T-Mobile are received by 911, but our dispatchers’ responses are not getting back to the caller.”</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>Texts to 911 using T-Mobile are received by 911, but our dispatchers’ responses are not getting back to the caller. If texting is your ONLY option, please make sure you include a full address including city, the nature of your emergency and as many details as you can. — Layton Police (@laytonpolice) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>According to TechCrunch, T-Mobile users are telling the company they cannot send or receive calls on their phones. TechCrunch reports that the ability to send and receive text messages is also being impeded.</p>
<p>T-Mobile Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Neville R. Ray, tweeted that the company is aware of the issue and is working to fix it.</p>

<p><img src="https://africatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DDos-200x200.jpg" alt="img">
South Africa’s Telkom wasn’t the only service to suffer an outage on Monday, although the nationwide disruption in its 086 call center services and its 0800 toll-free numbers caused plenty of business disruption.</p>
<p>In the United States, it seemed like every communications service was down as what many suspect was a massive DDoS attack stretched on for hours and knocked more and more providers offline. By late Monday the entire country was affected, including customers of major carriers Sprint, Verizon, AT&amp;T, as well as Instagram and other services.</p>
<p>Those outages interfered with call and text services across borders too, with Brazil and other nations reporting impacts.</p>
<p>“Our engineers are working to resolve a widespread routing issue affecting voice and text,” said T-Mobile in a Twitter message. “Customers may experience longer care wait times. Please try third-party calling apps (FaceTime, WhatsApp, Signal) as a temp solution.”</p>
<p>Facebook was seeing problems too, though, according to the DownDetector website. While the disruptions appeared to affect the U.S. and Europe the most, parts of Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia also showed Facebook outages. People turned to Twitter to talk about the outage and speculate on a DDoS attack, but it wasn’t long before Twitter was showing pockets of disruption too, again in the U.S. and Europe as well as Japan.</p>
<p>DDoS, or direct denial of service, is an intentional cyberattack that floods systems with massive amounts of activity so that legitimate users are unable to access services.</p>

<h3 id="t-mobile-says-its-working-to-fix-widespread-network-issues">&ldquo;T-Mobile says it&rsquo;s working to fix widespread network issues&rdquo;</h3>
<p>By TALI ARBEL</p>
<p>AP Technology Writer</p>
<p>T-Mobile, one of the three largest mobile carriers in the U.S., said it&rsquo;s working to fix a widespread network issue.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s president of technology, Neville Ray, tweeted Monday afternoon at around 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time that T-Mobile engineers hope to fix the “voice and data issue” soon. At 6 p.m., Ray tweeted that data services were back up, but that calls and texts were still having problems. He recommended customers use WhatsApp, iMessage and other communications tools instead.</p>
<p>The scope of the outage wasn&rsquo;t clear, but Ray said it has affected customers around the country. T-Mobile representatives did not reply to further questions.</p>
<p>People on Twitter complained that calls were not going through. The Redmond, Washington, police department tweeted that T-Mobile customers should have “an alternate plan in place in the event you need to call 911.”</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon both said their networks were operating normally. But calls between their customers and T-Mobile customers could have problems because of T-Mobile&rsquo;s issues.</p>
<p>T-Mobile became one of the country&rsquo;s largest carriers, along with AT&amp;T and Verizon, after buying rival Sprint. The company has started integrating the two networks.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees voice and data networks, said its public-safety bureau is looking into the problem.</p>
<p>T-Mobile paid a $17.5 million fine for two nationwide service outages on the same day in August 2014, which together lasted three hours and prevented customers from being able to call 911.</p>
