<p>Financial systems around the world are developed by a niche set of ultra-geniuses. These systems are so robust it’s difficult to find a loophole in them. However, every now and then, a fraudster (or a group) – also remarkably intelligent in their own leagues – breach the system. Sometimes, these fraudsters escape the grip of the law, and other times, they serve long term sentences for their deeds. But, at the same time, their infamous acts also become a good telltale or a topic of a documentary movie or series. Here, we’ve rounded up documentaries on Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar featuring some of the most cunning scams of all time.</p>
<p>7 money scam documentaries on Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar to watch this week</p>
<ol>
<li>Jamtara: Sabka Number Aayega – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>Netflix has been producing some brilliant content for its Indian audience, and one could say that Jamtara is one of their best Indian original shows. The show takes you through the dark crimes — from the open fields to the oceans in Jamtara. The fictionalised remake is inspired by true events and is exceptionally well-executed, to say the least. The scam run by small-town boys is still among the top few cyber crimes in India.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Dirty Money – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with this brilliant docu-series, every episode is a deep dive into cases of financial misconduct, scandals and corruption in the business world. The second season is particularly interesting. It explores the cases of the Wells Fargo banking scandal, Malaysia’s infamous 1MDB corruption case and takes a look into the real estate empire of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Each episode is like a full-fledged movie on Netflix that you won’t be able to stop watching.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Enron: The Smartest Guys in the room – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>The Enron Corporation was the living example of modern corporate corruption which is explored in this documentary. The company creates a stream of illegal schemes that bring in huge amounts of cash, simultaneously tainting customers and the government. They also instigated the California energy crisis to aid their business as utility prices go up – another problem for American citizens. The groups, often referred to as “the smartest guys in the room”, were people that decided to keep minting money at any cost.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The China Hustle – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>From the producers of Enron, comes another daunting money scam documentary. Based in China, the 2018 release was also termed as the most important film of the year by Forbes. It had a limited theatre release and focuses on the impending collapse of the Chinese market. Unlike most others on this list, the documentary looked at an ongoing scandal rather than a forgone scam. It looked at how a string of various misleading policies could lead to a long-incoming economic disaster in America and China.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Fyre – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule had come together to create the most luxurious music festival the world has ever seen. The location was set to be on an island claimed to be formerly owned by Pablo Escobar. They also invested a lot of money into advertising this festival, by spreading the word through influencers, models and also advertising heavily on social media. The expensive passes sold out quickly enough, except when the people got there, there was no festival but rather wet mattresses, relief tents and cold box-packed sandwiches to eat. While it seemed like an event gone wrong, it was a well-planned and executed fraud.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The Inventor: Out For Blood In Silicon Valley – Disney+ Hotstar</li>
</ol>
<p>The Inventor features one of the most dangerous scammers of this era. Elizabeth Holmes was the CEO of, Theranos, a health and technology company that was also founded by her. But, the scam came in the picture when she faked that her machine could run tests on small amounts of blood. Not only did her machine not work but she also scammed investors and, not to mention, patients – with inaccurate results.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Sour Grapes – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>Sour Grapes, a part of the food industry documentaries on Netflix, features alcohol but focuses more on the scam built around fake wine. This documentary looks at the ugly side of the food and beverage industry. Indonesian wine collector Rudy Kurniawan is at the thick end of the scam and shows how he purchased empty wine bottles, filled them up with cheap wine and packaged with fake, expensive labels.</p>

<h3 id="review-watching-a-documentary-about-jeffrey-epstein-is-like-watching-a-monster-movie">&ldquo;Review: Watching a documentary about Jeffrey Epstein is like watching a monster movie&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sfc-datebook-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/MERa44d4950f412da2b56b4414691faa_epstein0527-700x500.jpg" alt="img">
That Jeffrey Epstein was a horrible person is hardly breaking news. The news in “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,” a four-part Netflix documentary, is just how horrible he was and in how many ways.</p>
<p>He was a liar and a crook. Though he looked smooth, he was thuggish in manner. He was a fraud and a poseur, and he was not only a sex criminal, but also a versatile sex criminal. He was even something like a cult leader, in terms of his ability to find, manipulate and dominate vulnerable girls and women.</p>
<p>The tone of “Filthy Rich” is measured. Its assertions are documented. But in essence, this is a monster movie, where you wait for somebody to kill the monster, except here the climax is not so satisfying. Here the monster dies offstage — he allegedly hangs himself in prison, though a number of experts dispute the suicide conclusion.</p>
<p>One big element in support of the suicide hypothesis is that two days before his death, Epstein transferred all his assets offshore, to make it harder for his victims to get at his money. Assuming he knew he was going to kill himself, that would be an action consistent with his pattern: spiteful, remorseless and — yes, let’s just use the word — evil.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that part of the success of this documentary is that Epstein makes such a satisfying villain. There’s no ambiguity here. There’s no feeling sorry for him, no other side to the story, no other side to the character. It’s a study in a distinct case of wickedness, someone with no conscience and no morals, who was armed with an uncanny ability to manipulate people.</p>
<p>He cheated and scammed his way to a fortune — the documentary supplies the details — and seemed to devote the rest of his life to satisfying his destructive sexual perversity. Along the way, he makes sure to work his way into friendships with people in power, so as to insulate himself from prosecution.</p>
<p>“Filthy Rich” includes interviews with many of his victims, now women in their 30s, 40s and 50s. His method was to find underage girls from tortured backgrounds and have them come to his house in Florida. He would promise them things and then ask them to give him a massage, for which they’d have to take off all their clothes. Usually, they’d say yes. Over time, he created a kind of pyramid scheme, where girls would bring in other girls and be rewarded with a $200 finder’s fee.</p>
<p>He also victimized young women in their early 20s. Several women talk about being raped by Epstein and then trafficked to his wealthy friends. One moment leaps out in particular. One of his accusers, Sarah Ronsome, says that, while she was being assaulted, she soon realized that the more upset and anguished she became, the happier Epstein got.</p>
<p>“Filthy Rich” deals with the long, long process of bringing Epstein to some form of justice. It tells how he was able to subvert and derail investigations and devotes considerable time to the plea deal his lawyers were able to negotiate with Florida federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta, who later became secretary of labor in the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Several women talk on camera about having sex, at Epstein’s urging, with famous people in his social circle, including Epstein’s lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew of Great Britain. Both men deny these allegations. Interestingly, though people say on camera that they saw Bill Clinton visiting Epstein at his estate, no one claims that Clinton had anything to do with the women. Clinton is portrayed as just one more of the wealthy, powerful people that Epstein courted.</p>
<p>The movie leaves no doubt as to the damage that Epstein caused. One woman says, “Before Epstein, I was someone else. The way I saw myself was like a flower opening up. Someone took that flower, plucked it from its roots, stepped on it and stomped on it.”</p>
<p>“Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich” becomes available on Netflix on Wednesday, May 27.</p>
<p>M“Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich”: Documentary. Directed by Lisa Bryant. (Unrated. 200 minutes. At Netflix.)

<h3 id="three-hbo-documentaries-about-hacking-and-fake-news-coming-to-showmax">&ldquo;Three HBO documentaries about hacking and fake news coming to Showmax&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gcs.thesouthafrican.com/2020/06/aca76c79-1111.jpg" alt="img">
Showmax has just released three HBO documentaries, each with a 100% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, that together paint a deeply disturbing portrait of America today.</p>
<p>Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America’s Elections</p>
<p>Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America’s Elections reveals the extent of vulnerabilities in America’s voting systems and the risks they pose to democracy.</p>
<p>From the team behind HBO’s 2006 Emmy-nominated documentary Hacking Democracy, Kill Chain follows Finnish hacker and cyber security expert Harri Hursti as he travels across the U.S. to show how American election systems remain dangerously unprotected.</p>
<p>Hursti has a long history of drawing attention to the vulnerabilities of election technology. In 2005, he hacked into a widely used voting machine in Florida. Despite widespread public outrage, the same machine is slated for use in many states in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>As the HBO documentary uncovers, despite official claims to the contrary, individuals and foreign states can still employ a dizzying array of simple, low-cost techniques to gain access to voting systems at any stage – from voter registration databases to actual election results to malware that can be widely distributed and anonymously activated without detection at any point.</p>
<p>News reports and government agencies have chronicled dozens of seemingly random, unrelated security breaches in the past, but Hursti asks us to consider them as part of a coordinated ‘kill chain’ – a military strategy that employs meticulous, long-game attacks. At the end of this kill chain: a breakdown in the public’s trust in elections, and with that collapse, a loss of faith in the democratic process itself.</p>
<p>The documentary is packed with alarming claims. In Washington DC, cyber-security expert Andrei Barysevich describes how the Election Assistance Commission, a federal advisory group that maintains comprehensive real-time data on every state in the country, was hacked by a Russian-speaking actor named ‘Rasputin’ in the lead-up to the 2016 Presidential election.</p>
<p>Despite claims by election-machine makers that they keep units under lock and key, Hursti finds a warehouse in Ohio full of AccuVote TSX machines, a model that will be used in the 2020 elections, being sold on eBay.</p>
<p>At Nevada’s Def Con, the world’s largest hacking convention, attendees experiment with current voting machines and discover, among other revelations, that votes could have been altered remotely, even from a car driving past a polling place.</p>
<p>In California, Hursti meets statistician Philip Stark, who created a method for ‘risk-limiting audits’, and found that a single machine at a polling place in a Democratic district in Georgia showed only Republican wins. Stark ran a simulation that found the likelihood of this disturbing anomaly to be one in a million.</p>
<p>A hacker, based in India, reveals that he hacked into Alaska’s voting systems on the day of the 2016 Presidential Elections and could have changed any vote or deleted any candidate.</p>
<p>As Time says, “This documentary will show you just how fragile our democracy really Is… If you don’t want to know how easy it is for a canny individual—or a malicious state actor—to hack into the electronic voting technology used in the U.S., don’t watch Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America’s Elections.”</p>
<p>After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News</p>
<p>In After Truth: Disinformation And The Cost Of Fake News, directed by Emmy nominee Andrew Rossi (Page One: Inside The New York Times), the victims of disinformation campaigns humanise the danger of ‘fake news.’</p>
<p>For example, James Alefantis talks us through the impact of Reddit-fueled conjecture that his family pizza restaurant in Washington DC hosted a child pornography ring with links to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The claim not only led to his staff receiving regular death threats but also an armed gunman bursting into the restaurant looking for proof of the crimes. In 2019, the FBI designated conspiracy theories like ‘Pizzagate’ as a new domestic terrorism threat.</p>
<p>The HBO documentary also talks to Aaron Rich, brother of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, who was killed in an attempted robbery but whose murder was linked online to the leak of Hillary Clinton’s emails to WikiLeaks – despite overwhelming proof that the Russians were behind the hacked server and leak, and a lack of any evidence that his murder was in any way connected. After Truth says the assassination theory was fueled by operatives like Jack Burkman and Jerome Corsi – both interviewed in the documentary – and broadcast on Fox News and Sean Hannity’s prime time show.</p>
<p>In a sequence that is both farcical and terrifying, After Truth follows Burkman and Jacob Wohl as they team up to stage a press conference to falsely accuse former FBI director Robert Mueller of sexual assault – seemingly timed to disrupt his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Of course, the documentary makes it clear that fake news predates the Trump Era. It explores the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy, where an eight-week military training exercise in Texas in 2015 was alleged to be a cover for President Obama to round up political dissidents and detain them in recently closed Walmarts in the area, which were supposedly linked by secret underground tunnels. This conspiracy theory gained so much momentum that the governor’s office assigned the state guard to monitor the exercise.</p>
<p>And After Truth makes it clear that some activists on the left have also tested out ‘fake news’ tactics, like during the 2017 senate race between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones, where the documentary shows that an online campaign was put in place to imitate Russian tactics to influence voters.</p>
<p>Decider calls After Truth “terrifying”, while The Hollywood Reporter hails it as “harrowing and relevant”, saying, “You may need a shower after watching After Truth. That, plus subscribing to a trusted newspaper and deleting our Facebook presence may be the most we can do.”</p>
<p>The Scheme</p>
<p>The HBO Sports documentary The Scheme chronicles an unprecedented two-year undercover FBI investigation into college basketball corruption that came to a dramatic climax on 26 September 2017, when Adidas executives and assistant coaches at ‘amateur’ major college programmes were arrested in a pay-for-play scheme.</p>
<p>While no head coaches were charged, the federal government alleged that a 25-year-old man was part of a criminal enterprise that had infiltrated college basketball and funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to steer recruits to prominent athletic programmes. The man’s name was Christian Dawkins.</p>
<p>Now, in The Scheme, Dawkins faces the camera for the first time and explains in fascinating detail how he ended up in a hotel suite surrounded by FBI agents with a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Through revelation after revelation, viewers will learn how Dawkins was orchestrating massive cash payments to top high school prospects with the help of Adidas, and, unbeknownst to him, undercover FBI agents. Dawkins will disclose not only the facts of the scheme, but the context of the FBI investigation. Ultimately, guilty verdicts on a range of fraud and bribery charges would leave Dawkins with approximately 18 months of prison time.</p>
<p>“This story is surprising in every way imaginable and goes far beyond the limits of a college recruiting scandal,” says director Pat Kondelis, whose 2017 account of the Baylor University basketball scandal, Disgraced, won the Emmy for Outstanding Sports Documentary.</p>
<p>Or as CNN put it, “The Scheme makes college basketball look bad, and the FBI look worse… It’s a riveting, meticulously detailed guide to a system that seemingly invites rule breaking at every turn.”

<p>10 new shows and movies on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar and HOOQ releasing between March 9-16, 2020</p>
<ol>
<li>Dirty Money Season 2 – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with this brilliant docu-series, every episode is a deep dive into cases of financial misconduct, scandals and corruption in the business world. This season will explore the cases of the Wells Fargo banking scandal, Malaysia’s infamous 1MDB corruption case and take a look into the real estate empire of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Each episode is like a full fledged movie on Netflix that you won’t be able to stop watching.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 11, 2020</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Elite Season 3 – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>Gossip Girl and Riverdale fans, this Spanish show should be your pick from all the new shows and movies on Netflix releasing this week. In the third season, the consequences of Marina’s murders will continue to be felt. It will mainly focus on the school’s reaction to this news and the fight for justice. Besides that, expect a steady stream of shocking hook ups and break ups.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 13, 2020</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Kingdom Season 2 – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest reasons why you should watch this show is to familiarise yourself with the world of Korean dramas. This Zombie drama is about how a Kingdom loses its monarch and is looking right in the eyes of a fatal plague. They look to their prince to rise to power and save his people. This show has a phenomenal cast, a great story line and beautiful sets, which is probably why it is quickly joining the recently-watched lists of subscribers around the world. And considering the position of the world currently, anything with a fatal plague will have you relating.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 13, 2020</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Test: A New Era for the Australian Team – Amazon Prime Video</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that scandal where Steven Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft from the Australian team were banned from international cricket for using sandpaper to tamper the ball during a test match. Well, this Amazon Original series takes you through their journey about how the team went through an untimely transition and the riveting truths from the Aussie dressing rooms. If you like sports documentaries, this is a must-watch for you in March.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 11, 2020</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Pushpavalli Season 2 – Amazon Prime Video</li>
</ol>
<p>Two years ago, Sumukhi Suresh fell in love with a guy she met at an organic store and followed him all the way to Bangalore. When her stalking came to light, the show had ended. Finally, the second season of this show is here and we finally get to know what happens next. From the trailers, it seems like Pushpavalli is back for revenge. The fact that a comedian can write something that’s funny and scary all at the same time, is the biggest reason for you to watch this.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 13, 2020</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Zombieland 2: Double Tap – Amazon Prime Video</li>
</ol>
<p>Starring Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson, this movie is about a Zombie attack (just in case the name didn’t give it away). Zombie slayers Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock leave the confines of the White House to travel to Graceland in Memphis, Tenn. Along the way, they encounter other post-apocalyptic warriors and a group of survivors who find refuge in a commune. What happens next is a lot of blood scatter, gun firing and rearguard action.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 15, 2020</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Westworld Season 3 – Hotstar</li>
</ol>
<p>This show can be best described as Wild West meets Sci-Fi. In the third season of this hit HBO show, Dolores (Evan Rachel Woods) and Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) will battle it out in the real world. On one hand, the former wants to further the host uprising, and on then there is the latter who is trying to make peace between humans and robots.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 16, 2020</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Black Monday Season 2 – Hotstar</li>
</ol>
<p>Back in October 1987, the world witnessed the worst stock market crash in the history of Wall Street. This day, then came to be known as Black Monday. Nobody could really unravel the reason behind the massive crash. But in this series, it seems that a group of outsiders who took on Wall Street royalty may have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Release Date: March 16, 2020</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Joker – HOOQ</li>
</ol>
<p>Playing one of the most anticipated characters of 2019, Joaquin Phoenix returned as a lead character after a long time. He also underwent a scrutinising body transformation for this role. The film was an absolute masterpiece and it was all thanks to the exceptionally brilliant characterisation and acting by Joaquin Phoenix. Unsurprisingly, the actor bagged the Oscar for the Best Actor, which gives you all the more reason for you to watch the film. You can rent the film on HOOQ for a one-time fee of Rs 89.</p>
<p>Release Date: Already released</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>The Matrix Trilogy – HOOQ</li>
</ol>
<p>If you pick this, you get the excuse to forget all about the other new shows and movies on Netflix and other streaming platforms this week. The Matrix trilogy is a must-watch for everybody. The premise is that the creation of artificial intelligence led to a race of self-aware machines that imprisoned mankind in a virtual reality system. Even though it was made over two decades ago, these movies are still relevant today and will most definitely blow your mind. Take this red pill, we promise you won’t regret it.</p>

This June, E! turns 30! To celebrate we&rsquo;re looking back at the most monumental moments in pop culture.</p>
<p>Even before the events of the past few weeks and months shifted our perspective on pretty much everything, what does and doesn&rsquo;t constitute a scandal has always been awfully subjective. One person&rsquo;s OMG is another&rsquo;s half-hearted shrug and all.</p>
<p>And to be fair, Hollywood&rsquo;s had more than a handful that run the gamut from garden-variety (think a solid early 2000s Hilary Duff-Aaron Carter-Lindsay Lohan love triangle or a surprising celeb split á la Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert) to mildly shocking (Ariana Grande&rsquo;s #donutgate, any breakup that can be attributed, at least in part, to the nanny) to the type of wrongdoing that involves a potential jail sentence.

In case you missed it, the much-awaited streaming platform Disney+ finally released in India in collaboration with Hotstar. This means that if you have already subscribed to Hotstar, you will now be able to watch all the content from Disney as well.

Considering that going out is not an option for the foreseeable future, here’s a compiled list of the best shows and movies to watch on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar this weekend.</p>
<p>7 best shows and movies on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar that you should check out this weekend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Money Heist (Part 4) – Netflix</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone’s favourite Spanish heist show’s fourth season is joining the roster of new shows and movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar. Just like Part 3, this one will also have eight episodes. From the teaser, it has been confirmed that besides the recurring characters from the previous three seasons, Berlin (Pedro Alonso) and Nairobi (Alba Flores) will also be seen in Part 4. It seems like we can now finally know what happens after the third season’s last episode left us with a major cliffhanger.</p>
<p>Release Date: April 3, 2020</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Panchayat (Season 1) – Amazon Prime Video</li>
</ol>
<p>By now, you may already be familiar with Jitendra Kumar’s (Shubh Mangal Zyaada Saavdhaan fame) acting chops. After delivering a hit alongside Ayushmann Khurrana, Jeetu, as he is fondly known among fans, returns to his roots by headlining web series mainly produced by The Viral Fever aka TVF. This one tells the story of a 20-something who moves to a remote village in UP in search of a job. Considering the star cast and the makers, we have no doubt that this web series will be a silent hit among all the new shows and movies to watch on Amazon Prime Video.</p>
<p>Release Date: April 3, 2020</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Maya Bazaar 2016 – Amazon Prime Video</li>

<p>Disney’s first South Asia-based film finally got a live-action remake last year. It is among the many Disney properties that will now be made available to Indian audiences via Hotstar.

However, you should watch this film to know what Aladdin, Princess Jasmine, Apu, Jaffar and the Genie would have looked like in real life.</p>
<p>Release Date: Already released</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Frozen II – Disney+ Hotstar</li>
</ol>
<p>Frozen was among the most popular films in the Disney universe in recent times and its sequel received equal appreciation.

<p>Release Date: Already released</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The Mandalorian – Hotstar</li>

<ol start="7">
<li>Toy Story 4 – Hotstar</li>

<h3 id="top-10-most-trending-movies-on-netflix-india-that-you-can-watch-this-week">&ldquo;Top 10 most trending movies on Netflix India that you can watch this week&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.gqindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/top-image-new1-1366x768.jpg" alt="img">
Recently, Netflix has been working towards making its platform more user-friendly. And so, it has unveiled a feature that lets you see the top 10 shows and movies on Netflix that are trending in India currently. This feature is unique for each country and the platform shows separate lists for its series and movies. It had been available in the UK and Mexico for the last six months and has now made it to the Indian shores. In their blog post about the update, Netflix said that the reason behind introducing this update was to “help all of us find something to watch more quickly and easily.”</p>
<p>How to find the top 10 shows and movies on Netflix?</p>
<p>This new feature will be added in the form of a row on the movies and show pages of the app and website. Moreover, shows and movies that make it to the top 10 will also be marked with a badge on the top-right corner to make them easier to spot on your homepage. And since you’re new to this, here’s are the 10 movies that have made it to the first-ever trending list in India.</p>
<p>Top 10 movies on Netflix India is currently binge watching</p>
<ol>
<li>The Body</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are someone who likes Bollywood thriller films, do check this one out. The story’s premise is that the body of a very successful businesswoman, played by Sobhita Dhulipale, goes missing. When the inspector in charge probes the case, he finds something to be fishy with her husband (Emraan Hashmi). You should watch this film for Sobhita’s performance. She does a brilliant job of portraying a borderline psycho.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Panipat</li>
</ol>
<p>The second movie to make it to the top 10 movies on Netflix India is this period drama based in the Maratha Empire. It comes from the mind of a maestro of this genre, Ashutosh Gowarikar, who gave us hits like Lagaan, Jodha Akbar and Mohenjo Daro. Featuring Arjun Kapoor, Kriti Sanon and Sanjay Dutt in pivotal roles, this movie tells the story of the Third Battle of Panipat. During this battle, under the leadership of Sadashiv Rao, the Maratha army rallied against the invading forces of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the King of Afghanistan.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Last Thing He Wanted</li>
</ol>
<p>This movie featuring Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck is based on an eponymous book written by Joan Didion. In this political thriller, a journalist has to drop her coverage of the 1984 Presidential election to care for her father. However, her life changes when she inherits the position of an arms deal for Central America. This film is fresh out of the theatres since it only released in late January. Lucky for you, it’s already on Netflix.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>12 Strong</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to see Chris Hemsworth keep aside his hammer and pick up a gun, check this movie out. It is set against the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Hemsworth plays Captain Mitch Nelson, who is leading a team of Special Forces into Afghanistan. After establishing an awkward partnership with the Northern Alliance, he and his team must take out the Taliban and its Al-Qaida allies. This is a classic military film and is not to be mistaken to be a true story.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>To All The Boys: PS I Still Love You</li>
</ol>
<p>This teenage rom-com was also among the top 10 movies on Netflix India. It’s a sequel to the superhit Netflix original, To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, featuring Lana Condor and Internet’s celebrity crush Noah Centineo. Unlike the first film where the duo is pretending to date, this time, Peter and Lara Jean are in an actual relationship. But now, one of Jean’s letters is going to reach a new recipient. It’s one of those films that works perfectly for a Netflix n Chill session with your BAE or a solo party with just a tub of ice cream.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Yeh Ballet</li>
</ol>
<p>If you liked Gully Boy, you may love this addition to all the new shows and movies on Netflix India. The film has two protagonists; both are very talented dancers however, they live in the city’s ugly underbelly and come from a weak financial background. While they are masters of their dance form, their life will change drastically when a Parisian ballet teacher comes into the picture. From getting their parents’ approval to putting on an entire recital, this film is the journey of how these two lads conquer it all, despite the odds being stacked against them.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Motichoor Chaknachoor</li>
</ol>
<p>Nawazuddin Siddique and Athiya Shetty came together for this comical drama. Released not-so-long-ago in November 2019, the movie didn’t particularly break the box office. However, it is a light one time- watch. In fact, with Nawaz showing off his impressive acting and commendable comic timing, this film brings more to the table than what the numbers say.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Shimla Mirchi</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though this film was released in January 2020, it was shot a long time ago. The story follows a young man named Avinash who has a stuttering problem and falls in love with Naina, played by Rakul Preet Singh. When he decides to write a letter confessing his feelings towards her, it mistakenly reaches her mom, played by Hema Malini who thinks that she has a secret admirer. This puts Avinash in a very awkward spot. Even though this film didn’t find a single buyer for five years, you should watch it for a starry-eyed Rajkummar Rao, who hadn’t become the superstar that he is today just yet.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Underworld: Blood Wars</li>
</ol>
<p>This film being a part of the top 10 movies on Netflix India list came as a bit of a surprise to us. But considering that our country loves all things supernatural, it kind of makes sense. It follows the life of a woman called Selene who wants to find a way to end the conflict between the Lycan clan and the Vampire faction. But in this process, her own life is on the line. You should watch this movie to know why people are watching it in the first place.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Kabir Singh</li>
</ol>
<p>And from the surprising to the obvious, Kabir Singh is the last of the top movies being watched on Netflix in India. When this film was released last year, it divided the audience in a major way. And despite all the flak it received for being misogynistic, Kabir Singh went on to become second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2019. Unsurprisingly, it has also landed seven nominations for the 65th Filmfare awards and won one.</p>
<p>A thing to note about this new Netflix feature is that, the ranking of the top 10 shows and movies will depend on how relevant a particular title is to you. So that means, the list will contain the same 10 titles for everybody. But, the order of these titles may differ from person to person. The other updates Netflix announced was a removal of the 30-day free trial and instead, you will now have to pay Rs 5 for your first-month trial period.</p>
