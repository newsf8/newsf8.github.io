Although many legitimate mobile applications designed to help people track and monitor symptoms of the Covid-19 coronavirus are beginning to reach the market, analysis of Android telemetry from Google Play and other third-party marketplaces has revealed that both relatively harmless opportunist developers and malicious cyber criminals have climbed on board the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Bitdefender researchers unearthed huge spikes in application scans containing either ‘covid’ or ‘corona’, from early March 2020, and that the number of scanned applications from the medical category increased by more than 35%. It identified 579 applications that contained coronavirus-related keywords in their manifest.</p>
<p>According to Bitdefender, many of these apps – 560 of them – were entirely legitimate and provided information on how to avoid infection, news updates regarding the coronavirus, and even medical appointment booking services.</p>
<p>However, many of them had absolutely nothing to do with the coronavirus, and some of the more malicious examples contained aggressive adware, or were bundled with malware, it added.</p>
<p>Among some of the less malicious and more opportunistic examples found were mobile games, such as Bubble Shooter Merge and Galaxy Shooter – Falcon Squad. The developers of both of these applications updated their app names within Google Play to include coronavirus-related keywords to improve their SEO and make their products more visible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the developer of ‘4K Wallpaper – only quality wallpapers!’ changed the name of their app to ‘Coronavirus (2019-nCov) – Protect yourself!’ although this developer did at least make an effort to update their app to include some coronavirus-themed wallpaper downloads.</p>
<p>Bitdefender’s research team, led by Liviu Arsene, said that Google had started making adjustments to search algorithms within Google Play to filter or remove dodgy coronavirus apps as soon as the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.</p>
<p>For example, keyword searches would display no search results in the app section of the Google Play Store, and Google also set up a dedicated webpage within the Google Play marketplace to display legitimate or relevant applications.</p>
<p>“Google Play also prohibits developers from capitalising on sensitive events and our long-standing content policies strictly prohibit apps that feature medical or health-related content or functionalities that are misleading or potentially harmful,” said Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai at the time.</p>
<p>However, said Bitdefender, at the time of disclosure, 22 apps using the ‘coronavirus’ keyword were still online, many of them official and listed under ‘Health and Fitness’ and ‘Medical’ categories. It said 280 apps had been removed, including many regional or global coronavirus tracking apps.

<p><img src="https://www.groundup.org.za/media/_versions/images/photographers/Nompendulo%20Ngubane/glebelands%20inspection%20in%20loco%202020_extra_large.jpg" alt="img">
The trial against the Glebelands Eight continued with testimony from the state’s fourth witness in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday. Last week, the court conducted an in loco inspection at the hostel in Umlazi. Photo: Nompendulo Ngubane</p>
<p>“In Glebelands you were supposed to be careful, be alert and know who you were talking to before you say anything,” a state witness told the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday.</p>
<p>The fourth state witness to testify in the “Glebelands Eight” trial told the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday that he became a police informer after seeing those close to him being brutally murdered in the Glebelands hostel.</p>
<p>He said the killers were known, but people were too scared to inform the police.</p>
<p>The witness, a deputy secretary in block 52 who testified in camera, said he had attended meetings where plans were hatched to kill William Mthembu and Thokozani Machi in the hostel, but he had never killed anyone.</p>
<p>The eight accused – Bhekukwazi Mdweshu, Khayelihle Mbuthuma, Vukani Mcobothi, Eugene Hlophe, Mbuyiselwa Ntshangase, Mondli Mthethwa and Mbhele – face 22 charges, including nine for murder, seven for attempted murder, and possession of illegal firearms and racketeering.</p>
<p>During the previous hearing, the witness revealed that a reward of R160,000 had been put up for a hitman to murder Mthembu and Machi, known as the “big fishes” at the hostel. Both Mthembu and Machi were shot and killed on 12 September 2015 at Montclair.</p>
<p>When cross examined by Advocate Martin Krog, representing Mdweshu and Ntshangase, the witness said he began dealing with the police after the murders of Mthembu and Machi in 2015.</p>
<p>He said that three days before the murder of Mthembu and Machi he received a phone call. “The person said he was working at Umlazi GG police station. He said he wanted a meeting with me. I told him I cannot talk while in Glebelands but I can only meet him at work.”</p>
<p>The witness said he could not recall the policeman’s name.</p>
<p>Krog asked if the witness had been involved in any of the crimes before he was contacted by the police? He said, “Issues will be discussed in my presence but I never killed anyone. I’m not saying I did not commit any crime. I was present at meetings where they talked about killing these people [Mthembu and Machi].”</p>
<p>The trial was adjourned at lunchtime after court interpreter, GG Khoza, raised concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“All the courts have closed down and people have been sent home. Our health and safety is a right not a privilege. We don’t know how safe we are. We have not been told what is happening in the building as we are continuing to work. We are placing our lives at risk and also placing our loved ones at risk by continuing working under these conditions,” said Khoza.</p>
<p>The lawyers representing the accused all indicated that they were willing to continue the hearing but Judge Nkosinathi Chili remanded the matter until Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, the case was remanded until 20 April. All of the accused will be remanded at Westville Prison until the next hearing date.

<h3 id="dont-panic-just-be-alert--prepared--dr-oz-explains">“Don’t Panic, Just Be Alert &amp; Prepared” – Dr. Oz Explains</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/942/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1180302649.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
Dr. Oz is reminding all of us to do our part to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, but this morning when he joined Chris &amp; Tiffany on Chris &amp; The Crew he emphasized that we shouldn&rsquo;t be panicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you panicked. We want you alert and prepared,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>You can listen to the full interview here, of course. And below we have some highlights noted for you to share with your friends:</p>
<p>Keeping Our Clothing Safe</p>
<p>We asked about our clothes. Are they helping to spread the coronavirus?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think it (the virus) lasts very long on fabrics. Somewhere between 4 hours and 24 hours,&rdquo; he said. So when you do have to go out, he advised taking your clothes off when you get home. You don&rsquo;t have to launder them every time, he said.</p>
<p>But for anything in our houses, he reminds us that &ldquo;soap is toxic to the virus.&rdquo; So this means your dishwasher, laundry machine, hand soap, etc. will all help to keep everyday objects in your home safe. Don&rsquo;t forget to clean that remote control too.</p>
<p>Ordering Food In&hellip; Is it Safe?</p>
<p>What about ordering takeout from so many of our local restaurants? Dr. Oz says, go ahead, but you&rsquo;ll want to take a few precautions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food itself is safe,&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re ordering take out right now. He suggests transferring the food to different containers because you don&rsquo;t know who has touched the packaging. But he cautions us about transferring money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bigger risk is money Don&rsquo;t forget that the virus lives on cash. Try to contract digitally, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luckily, many local businesses, of course, are accepting digital payments.</p>
<p>What About Travel&hellip; Is It Safe?</p>
<p>We had a few questions raised about travel right. There are cheap flights all over the place. So is it OK to jump on those?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I personally would not travel anywhere, unless I had to (right now),&rdquo; Dr. Oz said. He explained in the interview above how that has worked to help the spread in other parts of the world (like China).</p>
<p>He explains how travelers from New York will be increasingly forced to quarantine when they arrive in other parts of the country and world.</p>
<p>Do We Need to Wear Medical Masks Out in Public?</p>
<p>Lastly, we asked about those very critical medical masks. Do we need to be wearing them outside right now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you have a severe medical problem&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t need to wear a mask out in public right now,&rdquo; Dr. Oz says, &ldquo;Save them for medical professionals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plus, he notes if you have a severe medical condition that you shouldn&rsquo;t be out of your house anyway. &ldquo;Stay low for a couple of weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Oz will join us again next Thursday. Have a question? Open the PST app &amp; click the chat button.</p>
