<h3 id="father-who-was-dragged-away-from-dying-childs-bedside-takes-legal-action">&ldquo;Father who was dragged away from dying child&rsquo;s bedside takes legal action&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e3.365dm.com/20/08/1600x900/skynews-rashid-abbasi-zainab-abbasi_5056709.jpg?20200802223802" alt="img">
A couple are taking legal action after being dragged away from the hospital bed of their dying daughter by police.</p>
<p>Bodycam footage shows Rashid Abbasi being forced away by Northumbria Police officers from his critically ill six-year-old daughter Zainab, who was being kept alive by a ventilator.</p>
<p>The doctors at a hospital in the North of England said half an hour before police were called they wanted to take the girl off the ventilator so she could be allowed to die.</p>
<p>But in an interview with Sky News the parents, Rashid and Aliya Abbasi, both doctors, said officers were &ldquo;being barbaric&rdquo; in what they describe was like &ldquo;living a nightmare&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image: Rashid Abbasi and his wife disagreed with the hospital&rsquo;s treatment plan</p>
<p>The footage, which has been shared with Sky News, is from an incident in August 2019, when staff at the hospital called police to attend because they say Dr Abbasi was being &ldquo;violent and abusive towards staff and that he had assaulted a consultant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Dr Abbasi denies that he was ever violent or abusive and said the police de-arrested him after he had a heart attack.</p>
<p>Zainab Abbasi was born with a rare-genetic illness which the family didn&rsquo;t know about until she was three years old.</p>
<p>In July last year the six-year-old&rsquo;s health rapidly deteriorated and she was admitted to hospital, struggling to breathe and was placed on a life support machine.</p>
<p>Image: Zainab Abbasi was born with a rare genetic illness</p>
<p>When the staff looking after Zainab wanted to take her off the ventilator that was breathing for her, her parents believed it wasn&rsquo;t the right thing to do which led to a bitter feud and police officers being called in.</p>
<p>Dr Abbasi said: &ldquo;They never listened to us, they would never provide explanations for their actions. I&rsquo;m a chest consultant, and have worked in the NHS for 30 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disease Zainab was suffering is not uncommon in adult populations, so I was able to ask leading questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife Aliya Abbasi told Sky News: &ldquo;The day before we were told they were going to ween her off and maximise her treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we were asking for, we said maximise her treatment, give her everything you can, give her what she needs which has worked in the past many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did none of that, so it was breakdown of trust. When police came we were being shouted at, we&rsquo;re human beings, we&rsquo;re parents and we&rsquo;re being told our daughter&rsquo;s about to die, but we were shouted at, we were being treated like scum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked whether Dr Abbasi was ever &ldquo;violent or abusive towards staff&rdquo; at the hospital he said: &ldquo;If that was right why didn&rsquo;t they come and arrest me and charge me? They let me go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that if I left the bed space, I would not be allowed to come back and they would do what they wanted to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image: Police and the NHS have defended their actions after Rashid Abbasi was arrested</p>
<p>After being detained by police Dr Abbasi suffered a heart attack and was taken to A&amp;E while still in custody.</p>
<p>His wife said: &ldquo;To be honest, we cannot explain what a nightmare this became. When my husband was being detained I was telling them he has a heart problem, he&rsquo;s had a problem for over 20 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I actually thought he was going to die, at one point I said to the nurses am I going to be organising two funerals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the incident, the NHS trust applied to the High Court for permission to take Zainab off the ventilator, but in mid-September, just three days before the hearing was due to start, she died.</p>
<p>Image: Aliya and Rashid Abbasi, who are both doctors, are taking legal action</p>
<p>Dr Abbasi says he wants justice for Zainab and wants to make sure this never happens to anyone again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are living a real hell today, and we want the whole world to see what happened at the bedside of a dying six-year-old child. I want the world to see so that it is not allowed to happen anymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No amount of money or gold would incentivise me to relive this. I want to make sure no other parents are treated the same way we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement Northumbria Police said: &ldquo;While we recognised this was a very distressing time for him and his family, our duty was to ensure the safety of all those present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have reviewed the body worn footage from the incident which sets out a very different picture to the limited version of events which have been presented to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hospital which was looking after Zainab right until she died offered its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the family, but told us its first priority is to always act in the best interest of its patients.</p>
<p>In a statement, it said: &ldquo;On very rare occasions, when there is a risk to the safety of any of the patients in our care, to relatives, visitors, or our staff - or obstruction or interference with the delivery of care and treatment - it is necessary for us to seek help from the police.&rdquo;

<h3 id="hsbc-profit-dives-65-as-it-warns-loan-losses-could-hit-10bn">&ldquo;HSBC profit dives 65% as it warns loan losses could hit £10bn&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e3.365dm.com/20/08/1600x900/skynews-hsbc-new-york_5056800.jpg?20200803064148" alt="img">
HSBC saw its pre-tax profit plummet by 65% in the first half of the year as the UK&rsquo;s largest bank was forced to hike funds to cover bad loans due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The lender reported profits of $4.3bn (£3.2bn) in the half year to 30 June, down from $12.4bn (£9.5bn) for the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>HSBC&rsquo;s results reflected the trend of lenders globally increasing their financial buffers to absorb loan losses as companies reel from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Image: Unrest in Hong Kong has added to the challenges of the Asia-focused bank</p>
<p>In response to the coronavirus pandemic the bank&rsquo;s provision for bad debts in the first-half soared to $6.9bn (£5.3bn), compared to $1bn (£760m) for the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>It had set aside $3bn (£2.3bn) to cover loan losses in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>HSBC said its total provisions against loan losses could be between $8bn (£6.1bn) and $13bn (£10bn) in 2020 - up from its April forecast due to the deteriorating global economic outlook and worse-than-expected actual losses in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The bank has suffered a turbulent year on the markets with the London listed shares falling more than 40% from 595p to 342p as of 30 June.</p>
<p>Image: As well as job cuts, other measures will be looked at, says HSBC boss Noel Quinn</p>
<p>Group chief executive Noel Quinn said: &ldquo;Our first half performance was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, falling interest rates, increased geopolitical risk and heightened levels of market volatility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Quinn had put the brakes on a large-scale redundancy programme as the coronavirus took hold.</p>
<p>However, plans to cut around 35,000 jobs worldwide will be accelerated.</p>
<p>The company will also look at other measures to take &ldquo;in light of the new economic environment to make HSBC a stronger and more sustainable business&rdquo;, Mr Quinn said in the half year results.</p>
<p>HSBC, along with other banks, complied with a Bank of England request to shelve dividends for shareholders on 1 April, with the bank saying it would not make payouts or have share buy-backs until the end of 2020.</p>
<p>In its update HSBC said its future dividend policy would be reviewed and added: &ldquo;Lower global interest rates and reduced customer activity have put increasing pressure on revenue, and are expected to continue to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker</p>
<p>Continuing tension between the US and China, and the outcome of post-Brexit negotiations will continue to have an impact on performance, according to the report.</p>
<p>It said: &ldquo;Our performance in the second half of the year will continue to be influenced by the path and economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geopolitical uncertainty could also weigh heavily on our clients, particularly those impacted by heightened US-China and UK-China tensions, and the future of UK-EU trade relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding to the challenges of the Asia-focused bank is political unrest in Hong Kong, whose economy shrank for the fourth quarter in the April-June period, posting the second biggest drop on record.</p>
<p>Mr Quinn said: &ldquo;We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors.&rdquo;

The cameraman was filming from a distance, through the dust-covered window of a car, but he managed to capture the scene before him.</p>
<p>A policeman and a soldier centred on a pair of local residents in a township in Harare, taking wild swings with their batons. The image was shocking and the message was clear - the authorities make the rules in these parts.</p>
<p>The residents fled in fear, smarting from the strikes on their limbs.</p>
<p>Image: Residents in Harare fled in fear as police and soldiers struck them with batons</p>
<p>Image: President Emmerson Mnangagwa took power in 2017</p>
<p>The incident took place during a nationwide shutdown ordered by the government of Emmerson Mnangagwa, who imposed the measure after opposition figures called for protests against corruption, economic mismanagement and the collapse of public services.</p>
<p>The president sees the situation differently, characterising public demonstrations as acts of insurrection and he has already moved against the man who tried to organise them.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Jacob Ngarivhume of the Transform Zimbabwe party has been charged and detained and awaits trial for incitement to participate in public violence.</p>
<p>He is joined at the Harare Remand Prison by a campaigning journalist called Hopewell Chin&rsquo;ono, who says his arrest is related to a series of exposes he produced about state-sponsored graft.</p>
<p>Image: Journalist Hopewell Chin&rsquo;ono was arrested on Monday</p>
<p>A small number did heed the call to protest, taking to the streets and dusty tracks with cardboard signs - despite the threat of arrest and imprisonment.</p>
<p>Award-winning author Tsitsi Dangarembga and colleague Julie Barnes were bundled into a police truck after their two-person protest, complete with signs stating &ldquo;we want better - reform our institutions&rdquo; and &ldquo;we want a better Zimbabwe for all&rdquo;, was shut down.</p>

<p>Image: Protesters demonstrated against claims of corruption and violence</p>
<p>Ms Dangaremgba was charged with incitement to commit violence and breaching COVID-19 health regulations at Harare&rsquo;s central magistrates' court.</p>
<p>Sky News caught up with the 2020 Booker Prize nominee after her bail hearing, where she told us she had the constitutional right to protest for a better country.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;All Zimbabweans want a better life for all Zimbabweans and the people who live here, and I think that&rsquo;s the right motive to have. It&rsquo;s a good thing to live by and work for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among dozens of other people who were arrested was the spokesperson for the main opposition party, the MDC Alliance.</p>
<p>Fadzayi Mahere broadcast her arrest on Facebook, filming riot police climbing a fence at a shopping centre in order to apprehend her.</p>
<p>Image: Fadzayi Mahere broadcast her arrest on Facebook</p>
<p>Later, she was granted bail and stopped to speak to Sky News, saying: &ldquo;It is an indictment on who we have become as a society when people cannot speak outside their homes and protest against all the injustice we see, the fact that corruption is killing us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are criminalising the very fact of speaking out, that cannot be the Zimbabwe we are seeking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>President Mnangagwa took power in 2017, promising higher living standards and world-class public services.</p>
<p>But he and his colleagues from the ruling ZANU-PF party have only managed to exacerbate the country&rsquo;s precarious economic situation.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is estimated at around 90% and inflation is running at over 700%. The cost of basic goods like bread and medicine is simply out of reach for most Zimbabweans.</p>
<p>Instead, President Mnangagwa is fast becoming associated with the man he replaced, the country&rsquo;s long-time dictator, Robert Mugabe.</p>
<p>Image: President Emmerson Mnangagwa ordered a nationwide shutdown</p>
<p>Despite orchestrating Mugabe&rsquo;s overthrow in 2017, Mr Mnangagwa has resorted to similar tactics to safeguard his rule.</p>
<p>Human rights groups such as Amnesty International accuse his government of orchestrating a brutal crackdown on human rights, including state-run witch-hunts against anyone who challenge his rule.</p>
<p>This weekend&rsquo;s shutdown and the associated arrests demonstrate that his regime is no longer prepared to sanction the smallest expressions of dissent.

New rapid tests that can detect coronavirus in just 90 minutes will start to be used in care homes and labs from next week.</p>
<p>The two new types of test do not require trained health staff to operate them and can also pick up other winter viruses.</p>
<p>Currently most results from tests carried out in-person are returned the following day, while home kits take longer.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: &ldquo;The fact these tests can detect flu as well as COVID-19 will be hugely beneficial as we head into winter, so patients can follow the right advice to protect themselves and others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Boris Johnson says he wants 500,000 coronavirus tests to be available every day by October amid fears of possible further waves in the winter.</p>

<p>450,000 LamPORE tests will be made available to care homes and labs in England from next week, with millions more to come later in the year.</p>
<p>The machines that process the tests come in desktop and palm versions and will be used in &lsquo;pop-up labs&rsquo; as well as in existing facilities.</p>
<p>A new DNA test will also be rolled out with 5,000 Nudgebox machines given to hospitals across the UK from September.</p>
<p>Eight London hospitals are already using the machines which analyse DNA in nose swabs to detect the virus.</p>

<p>It comes as the government prepares to convene a round table meeting with care home providers who have been unable to access regular testing.</p>
<p>Last week, Sky News revealed that two major UK care firms were unable to access regular testing because of an issue with a government supplier.</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s Jonathan Ashworth said: &ldquo;With infections rising, it&rsquo;s frankly negligent ministers have failed to deliver on their promise to regularly test care home residents and staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>:: Listen to the All Out Politics podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Social Care insists it is sending thousands of tests to care homes but did admit that supplier issues have caused delays.</p>
<p>Ministers hope the fact that no clinical training is needed to operate these new rapid test machines will allow them to be used in a wider range of settings.

A cluster of 13 coronavirus cases has been linked to a bar in Aberdeen.</p>
<p>The patients tested positive for COVID-19 after visiting The Adam Lounge &amp; Hawthorn Bar on 26 July, NHS Grampian said.</p>
<p>Authorities are investigating and say they cannot rule out the possibility of finding more cases linked to the cluster.</p>
<p>Dr Emmanuel Okpo, consultant in public health medicine, said: &ldquo;Our health protection team are speaking to the confirmed cases. We are also carrying out wider contact tracing work, as part of the test and protect scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Adam Lounge &amp; Hawthorn Bar said it has done its &ldquo;utmost&rdquo; to protect customers' safety and has had &ldquo;strict rules and measures in place&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>A statement on the family-run bar&rsquo;s Facebook page read: &ldquo;It has been brought to our attention that there have been customers who visited our venue on Sunday 26th July that have tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wish to inform all customers that we have been visited by Environmental Health since being notified. We were given approval from the local authority to continue trading with our measures in place and have cooperated fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It said it is a &ldquo;very difficult time&rdquo; for the bar, adding: &ldquo;Our thoughts are with those affected and we wish them a speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bar has been deep cleaned and decontaminated.</p>
<p>:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker</p>
<p>Authorities said the business had a number of measures in place including physically distancing customers and taking their contact details.</p>
<p>It has now been advised on how to improve further and has co-operated fully with the investigation.</p>
<p>Many showed their support for the bar on social media following the news.</p>
<p>Kirsty Wheeler wrote: &ldquo;Thank you for making customers aware. Having seen the set up, you&rsquo;ve done everything you can to protect your staff and customers and this is very responsible of you to let people know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another commenter, Chris Milton, said: &ldquo;End of the day it&rsquo;s a great bar trying it&rsquo;s best to serve its loyal customers. There is a risk and that&rsquo;s why there are measures in place. No one is forcing you to go to the pub. Personal responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scotland reported 31 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the total to 18,676.</p>
