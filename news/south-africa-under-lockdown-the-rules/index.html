South Africa’s ministers have provided clarity on the lockdown procedures which are being implemented from midnight, Thursday March 26.</p>
<p>Prohibition of movement</p>
<p>Minister of Police Bheki Cele outlined exactly what is prohibited with regards to movement during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Citizens won’t be allowed to leave their homes except for necessary movement, including shopping for groceries, medicine or medical care, attending funerals and collecting social grants.</p>
<p>– Any place or premise normally open to public where religious, culture, sporting, entertainment, recreational or exhibition events happen are prohibited.</p>
<p>– Locations where goods, other than essential goods, are acquired, disposed of or sold are closed.</p>
<p>– Parks, beaches, swimming pools, markets, nightclubs, casinos cannot be open. Hotels, guesthouses, lodges, private and public game reserves are closed with the exception of their current guests.</p>
<p>– On-consumption liquor premises, such as bars, shebeens, taverns are required to be closed.</p>
<p>– Off-consumption liquor premises, like liquor stores and supermarket will not be allowed to sell alcohol.</p>
<p>– Shopping malls, excluding grocery stores and pharmacies are closed.</p>
<p>– Restaurants and food delivery services are closed.</p>
<p>Citizens cannot leave their homes to walk their dogs, go for a jog or walk.</p>
<p>“You can walk your dog around your house and it can’t go beyond that,” said Cele.</p>
<p>Restricted opening hours for grocery stores are being discussed and citizens are asked to go to their closest store, which includes spaza shops.</p>
<p>Those found breaking the lockdown are liable to 6 months imprisonment or a fine or both.</p>
<p>“For 21 days, please stay sober,” said Cele.</p>
<p>Cele also explained that there would be an increase in units available to deal with women and child abuse. He advised those who experience abuse during the lockdown to call 0800428428.</p>
<p>All other reports should continue through the standard police line, 1011.</p>
<p>Deployment of the South African Defence Force</p>
<p>The South African Defence Force will be deployed to assist the South African Police with the lockdown measures.</p>
<p>They will be supporting roadblocks and undertaking foot patrols across the country. They will also ensure all ports remain closed as per lockdown instructions.</p>
<p>SA military health services will also continue to work with all health authorities to provide essential health to the public.</p>
<p>“We reiterate to all South Africans to stay at home for the duration of the lockdown,” said Minister of Defence Nosiviwe Noluthando Mapisa-Nqakula, “Lockdown is not meant to punish citizens.”</p>
<p>She explained that the current movement of troops is not yet an official deployment but rather preparations.</p>
<p>Transportation during the lockdown</p>
<p>Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula clarified exactly how essential workers would be transported across the country during this time.</p>
<p>Mini-bus taxis, metered taxis and e-hailing services will be allowed to continue to transport essential workers and those leaving for the specified purposes under stricter rules.</p>
<p>They will only be allowed to transport between 5am – 9am and 4pm-8pm every day. During this time people can use transport to the shop and get medical care.</p>
<p>All transport needs to be sanitised after each trip and taxi ranks need to be sanitised regularly.</p>
<p>The number of passengers in metered taxis and e-hailing services are lowered. A car allowed to take four people can now only take one. A vehicle able to seat 8 can only take three.</p>
<p>All trains, both commuter and private are shutdown.</p>
<p>All long-distance passenger buses and cross-border passenger transport is prohibited. Only cargo can be transported across the country and into neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>All long distance passenger services both public and private will stop during shutdown.</p>
<p>Limited bus services will continue to run for essential workers.</p>
<p>The Department of Transport has committed to keep a skeleton staff to deal with transport incidences, including accidents. Those whose drivers licenses expire during lockdown will get given a 14 day grace period after the lockdown ends.</p>
<p>Price gouging report hotline</p>
<p>Price fixing and gouging of essential products has already been identified. The Minister reported 30 investigations of stores who have been reported as inflating prices.</p>
<p>Stores hiking prices have been asked to supply reasons why they are doing so. Most price hikes were noted on hand sanitiser and face masks but also basic food items.</p>
<p>Three of these investigations were in Cape Town for overpriced hygiene goods.</p>
<p>Those wanting to report suspected price hikes can call 084 743 0000.</p>
<p>Social grant distribution will continue</p>
<p>Social grant recipients will still be allowed to collect their grants. Transport will be provided for those to go to pay points.</p>
<p>A manager will be placed at a pay point to manage lines and assist with hygiene procedure adherence. Grant recipients were asked to comply with regulations and behave accordingly at pay points.</p>
<p>Those who require assistance may call the Sassa call centre 0800601011.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8377/8439267683764177bfd224f4921e4d1a.png" alt="img">
What stores will be open, and what are you allowed to do during the 21-day lockdown in SA?</p>
<p>Here is what we know about the national shutdown in South Africa to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which starts on Friday.</p>
<p>This article is updated as information becomes available; check back for more.</p>
<p>For more stories go to <a href="http://www.BusinessInsider.co.za">www.BusinessInsider.co.za</a>.</p>
<p>(This article is constantly updated, throughout, as new information becomes available. Last updated: 20:45, 25 March 2020)</p>
<p>South Africa enters a national shutdown on Friday, 27 March. From one minute after midnight, South Africans will be expected to stay home except under very specific circumstances, and businesses that are not essential must be shut down.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the rules could lead to a month in jail, or a fine.</p>
<p>The lockdown is intended to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus behind Covid-19.</p>
<p>Details of exactly how day-to-day life will work continue to emerge, as the government scrambles to deal with the logistics of implementing the new restrictions.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know, so far, about South Africa&rsquo;s lockdown, and what you can and can not do.</p>
<p>You can use Uber and taxis during lockdown, but only at these times.</p>
<p>Those looking to make use of e-hailing vehicle services along with taxis and buses will be on strict schedules during lockdown.</p>
<p>Uber, taxis and other vehicles will transport ‘essential workers” and those performing ‘essential duties’ only during certain times during lockdown, said Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula, during Wednesdays’ inter-ministerial briefing.</p>
<p>Transport movement will only be allowed to operate from 05:00 to 09:00 and then again from 16:00 to 20:00. People will be allowed to use these services to buy food and to collect medicine, and other essential services.</p>
<p>All vehicles will need to be sanitised at regular intervals with metered taxis and e-hailing vehicles required to be sanitised after each journey. Sanitiser used in all vehicles must have at least 60% alcohol.</p>
<p>The number of passengers per each vehicle allowed will also be reduced to 50% of that vehicles licenced capacity.</p>
<p>This means a vehicle licensed to carry up to 4 people will only be permitted to load 1 person, with the other being a driver. For a vehiclelicensed for eight passengers it would be only be 3.</p>
<p>You may not buy booze for 21 days</p>
<p>Police minister Bheki Cele has announced that no alcohol will be sold during the lockdown and that people may not transport alcohol from one point to another.</p>
<p>Cele also reiterated that no restaurants will be allowed to operate during the 21-day lockdown. “Go buy your food and cook it at home,” he said.</p>
<p>Perpetrators found guilty of lockdown offences will get a fine or six months in jail, or both.</p>
<p>Yes, foreign-owned spaza shops will be open – as long as they are properly licensed.</p>
<p>On Tuesday small business development Khumbudzo Ntshavheni caused confusion by seeming to say that only spaza shops owned by South Africans will be able to stay open during the national Covid-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>On Wednesday her office told Business Insider South Africa that all properly licensed such shops will be expected to stay open – regardless of whether they are foreign owned. That is expected to be reflected in regulations, which will make the lockdown rules law.</p>
<p>Spazas fall under municipal jurisdiction for their licensing, and what the minister apparently meant to say was that only properly licensed (and so considered safe) spaza shops will be excluded from the blanket shut-down.</p>
<p>You may not walk your dog.</p>
<p>In some countries lockdowns specifically made provision for jogging close to home, or other forms of outdoor exercise done with care to avoid contact with other people. Some local governments even encouraged outdoor exercise, as a mental health measure.</p>
<p>In a briefing on Wednesday it was announced that you will not be allowed to walk your dog in South Africa once lockdown is in place.</p>
<p>Your boss can force you to take leave.</p>
<p>Your employer can force you to take leave during the lockdown period, and they will be well within their rights to do so.</p>
<p>For many South Africans, that may end up being the least worse-case scenario.</p>
<p>Employees who won&rsquo;t be allowed to work during the lockdown period of three weeks, which starts on Thursday night, are to a large degree at the mercy of their employers.</p>
<p>While government has encouraged all businesses to continue to pay their employees, who may be stuck at home and won’t be able to work during this time, many companies can’t afford this and are considering other options.</p>
<p>This may include scrapping the traditional shutdown period over December and into January.</p>
<p>All restaurants, bars and coffee shops will be closed – including food delivery services.</p>
<p>All major food delivery services, including Uber Eats and Mr D Food, and restaurants will have to close during the national lockdown starting on Friday, the department of tourism confirmed.</p>
<p>The department of tourism said essential services do not include restaurants, cafes, bars and coffee shops and they will, therefore, have to be closed for the duration of the lockdown.</p>
<p>All food services will be suspended.</p>
<p>ATMs and bank branches will have cash available.</p>
<p>Banks will coordinate among themselves and sharing resources to ensure that bank notes area available at ATMs and bank branches, trade and industry minister Ebrahim Patel said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>South Africa had done &ldquo;extraordinary things to enable the banking system to remain strong&rdquo;, he said.</p>
<p>You will be able to go shopping – for essentials – and seek medical care.</p>
<p>Movement restrictions do not apply for shopping trips, when you need food or other important groceries, and trips to the pharmacy are also specifically allowed.</p>
<p>A general call to avoid using medical services except for the most urgent matters remains in place, but going to and from healthcare providers is allowed throughout the shutdown. (If you believe you may have Covid-19, contact the National Institute for Communicable Diseases on 0800 029 999. You can also send &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to 060 012 3456 via Whatsapp for information.)</p>
<p>Spaza shops will remain open, and will be supported.</p>
<p>Spaza shops are among the retailers considered vital, the government confirmed on Tuesday. They will not only remain open, they will be supported with bulk buying and in other ways, to keep their selves full.</p>
<p>But, like with support being extended to other small businesses, they must be owned by South Africans to qualify for the help.</p>
<p>Harvests, and livestock auctions, are due to go ahead.</p>
<p>Specific measures will be taken to ensure that food production and imports continue, minister of agriculture, land reform andrural development Thoko Didiza said at a media briefing.</p>
<p>Livestock auctions will be allowed to continue, albeit with restrictions on the number of people allowed to attend. Upcoming harvests will be accommodated, she said, and imports of agricultural commodities will continue.</p>
<p>You will be allowed to take your pets to the vet.</p>
<p>Essential and emergency travel is expected to be specifically allowed during the lockdown, in general terms.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the government confirmed that veterinary services will continue to operate.</p>
<p>Necessary trips for pet food are also likely to be covered under rules around buying groceries.</p>
<p>Grocery stores, pharmacies, and some other businesses are due to remain open.</p>
<p>Announcing the measures on 23 March, President Cyril Ramaphosa listed the kinds of businesses that are expected to remain open during the shutdown. The list is not exhaustive, and must be formalised through formal regulations.</p>
<p>These are the types of businesses Ramaphosa said would remain open.</p>
<p>Pharmacies</p>
<p>Laboratories</p>
<p>Banks</p>
<p>Essential finance systems, such as the JSE</p>
<p>Supermarkets</p>
<p>Petrol stations</p>
<p>Healthcare providers</p>
<p>Companies involved in making or distributing food, basic goods, and medical supplies.</p>
<p>Provision is also to be made for the transport of essential workers.</p>
<p>Travel is restricted for everyone except specific classes of workers.</p>
<p>Everyone must stay home during the shutdown, except workers classed as critical.</p>
<p>The list must still be formalised by publication, but these are the categories of workers Ramaphosa said would be allowed to travel.</p>
<p>Health workers, in both the public and private sectors</p>
<p>Emergency workers</p>
<p>Security services, including police, soldiers, traffic officers</p>
<p>Those in the production, supply and distribution of food and other basic goods</p>
<p>Those in essential banking systems</p>
<p>People who maintain water, electricity, and similar systems.</p>
<p>On Tuesday trade and industry minister Ebrahim Patel added the following people to that list:

<h3 id="sa-lockdown-better-earlier-than-later-to-prevent-covid-19-spread">&lsquo;SA lockdown better earlier than later to prevent Covid-19 spread&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/v1584361106/n7rfdvxl7cdiig1fu2fa.jpg" alt="img">
The Health Professional Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has already implemented a business continuity plan which has taken most administrative processes online and reduces physical contact after the president announced a state of disaster.</p>
<p>It is now imperative that practitioners use their online service and will get all the support they need. Dr Kgosi Letlape, President - HPCSA</p>
<p>Dr Kgosi Letlape talks to Clement Manyathela.</p>
<p>You cannot have normal rules applying in a national disaster and we will do all we can to facilitate as many patients to have consultations. Dr Kgosi Letlape, President - HPCSA</p>
<p>He says they are as prepared for the increase of Covid-19 cases as they can be given the challenges of the private and public health dichotomy.</p>
<p>Resources a re low and will remain a challenge, he adds.</p>
<p>As doctors and health care professionals we still have an ethical duty to all patients. Dr Kgosi Letlape, President - HPCSA</p>
<p>We are just asking practitioners to follow the rules, to be careful, to protect themselves and not be cavalier. Dr Kgosi Letlape, President - HPCSA</p>
<p>Looking at what has happened in other countries where almost 1 in 10 people infected is health care workers.</p>
<p>So we are really at risk and we have to learn to work Dr Kgosi Letlape, President - HPCSA</p>
<p>We are hoping that rather sooner than later in provinces like Gauteng, will go into a more serious mode of restriction. A lockdown is better earlier than later. We should lockdown to prevent the spread of the disease, rather than lockdown to try and control an epidemic that would be out of control. Dr Kgosi Letlape, President - HPCSA</p>
