<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput and his mother | Photo Credit: Instagram</p>
<p>New Delhi: Actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who committed suicide at his residence in Mumbai, had recently shared an emotional post on Instagram along with a picture of his mother. The &lsquo;Kai Po Che&rsquo; actor was 16 years of age when his mom had passed away in 2002.</p>
<p>He was found hanging in his apartment in Bandra on Sunday morning, and a domestic help alerted the police. Police have said that they were investigating the reason why the actor, who had started out with the Television industry, took his life. No suicide note has been found.</p>
<p>On June 3, Rajput posted a picture of his mother on Instagram and wrote: &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops Unending dreams carving an arc of smile and a fleeting life, negotiating between the two&hellip;(sic)&quot;.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last big-screen release was Rajkumar Hirani&rsquo;s Chhichhore.</p>
<p>The actor, who became popular with his starring role in the television show Pavitra Rishta made his foray into films with Kai Po Che! in 2013. He has starred in movies such as Shuddh Desi Romance, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Raabta, Kedarnath and Sonchiriya.</p>
<p>Incidentally, his ex-manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, had ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9. Bollywood and social media reacted with shock and disbelief on hearing the news of Rajput&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe this at all&hellip; it’s shocking&hellip; a beautiful actor and a good friend&hellip; it’s disheartening #RestInPeace my friend #SushantSinghRajput. Strength to the family and friends,” actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui said.

<h3 id="actor-sushant-singh-rajput-34-found-dead-police-say-suicide">&ldquo;Actor Sushant Singh Rajput, 34, Found Dead; Police Say Suicide&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/f747m5no_sushant-singh-rajput_625x300_15_January_19.jpg" alt="img">
Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide at his home in Mumbai. The actor was 34.</p>
<p>The news has sent shockwaves through the film industry and comes a few days after his former manager Disha Salian reportedly killed herself.</p>
<p>According to reports, the award-winning actor was found hanging from his ceiling in his Bandra residence in Mumbai.</p>

<p>Singh is a self-made star who has acted in films including &lsquo;Shudh Desi Romance&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo;. His close friend in Dubai Raza Beig, CEO of Splash, expressed his deep shock.</p>
<p>“He was one of my closest friends. We have hung together in Dubai a lot. I still can’t believe that he has gone,” said Beig.</p>
<p>Singh was living alone in his residence during the lockdown. According to Mumbai Police, the reason for his suicide is yet to be confirmed and post mortem reports are awaited.</p>
<p>Singh Rajput was a self-made star who was a perfect antidote to the nepotism charge plaguing Bollywood.</p>

<p>The Patna-born outsider was a young actor who made it through merit alone. He didn’t have powerful industry connections, nor was he born into an acting dynasty, but rather chose to make a mark through a clutch of meaningful films. His career catalogue is lean but rich with content-driven films.</p>
<p>The actor, who made ripples in Bollywood through director Abhishek Kapoor’s ‘Kai Po Che!’, has acted in several good films including &lsquo;Detective Byomkesh Bakshi&rsquo; (2015) and &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Instead of being prolific and acting in myriad projects, Rajput belonged to the new breed of actor who believed in quality than quantity.</p>
<p>Apart from a few creative misfires like his recent Netflix film &lsquo;Drive&rsquo; and re-incarnation drama &lsquo;Raabta&rsquo;, the actor has always shone in lead hero roles.</p>
<p>CELEBS MOURN SINGH</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar expressed his shock in a tweet. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I’d enjoyed the film and wish I’d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actor Aftab Shivdasani also tweeted his shock. &ldquo;Sushant nooo!! that’s the most disturbing news!!! Broken&hellip; so so so sad.. why? Why end such a young and beautiful life that too suicide??!! So so heartbroken..&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dancer Mukti Mohan tweeted: &ldquo;This is so unsettling&hellip;Can&rsquo;t believe such a happy dancing soul is not among us now. #SushantSinghRajput You rest in peace in your mother&rsquo;s lap my friend. Heartiest condolences to all his loved ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub tweeted: &ldquo;Still can’t believe the news&hellip;.so so so painful to hear this&hellip;can’t say anything&hellip;it’s to much to handle..just rest in peace my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actor&rsquo;s last Instagram post, put up a week ago, was a tearful ode to his late mother.
