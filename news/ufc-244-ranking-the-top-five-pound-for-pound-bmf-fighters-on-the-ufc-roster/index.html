<p>Watch Now: UFC 244: Nate Diaz vs Jorge Masvidal Expert Prediction ( 0:38 )</p>
<p>When Nate Diaz returned to the Octagon with a win over Anthony Pettis following an almost three-year absence, he blamed the current crop of fighters for his time off. &ldquo;The reason I was off was because everybody sucked,&rdquo; Diaz said. He then singled out Jorge Masvidal, who was sitting cageside, as a fellow &ldquo;gangster&rdquo; he&rsquo;d like to meet in the cage. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about, the baddest motherf&mdash;&ndash; title. I need that belt made as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, the &ldquo;BMF&rdquo; title was born. A Diaz post-fight concept turned physical belt to be awarded &ndash; by Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson, no less &ndash; to the winner of the UFC 244 main event between Diaz and Masvidal.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t get enough UFC? Subscribe to our podcast State of Combat with Brian Campbell where we break down everything you need to know in the Octagon.</p>
<p>The BMF ideal is about more than wins and losses. It&rsquo;s an aesthetic. It&rsquo;s a mindset. It&rsquo;s a lifestyle. But, are Masvidal and Diaz the kings of the mythical BMF realm? The CBS Sports crew sat down to compile a list of who we feel are the top pound-for-pound BMFs in the UFC.</p>
<p>The rankings were compiled with input from Brent Brookhouse, Brian Campbell, Jack Crosby and Brandon Wise.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Robbie Lawler: When you think of a stone-cold killer in UFC, only one name truly comes to mind. With his largely emotionless personality, &ldquo;Ruthless&rdquo; has done nothing but embark on a savage run as a fighter while mostly saying what he will do. When asked in 2016 what would happen if he stepped in the cage with Conor McGregor, Lawler said in the simplest and most pointed words, &ldquo;If I hurt him, I wouldn&rsquo;t take his neck &hellip; [I&rsquo;d take] his soul.&rdquo; Lawler also engaged in one of the most hellacious wars in UFC history against RoryMacDonald in 2015 where he walked through the fire to score a fifth-round TKO and retain his welterweight title while suffering an incredibly gruesome cut on his mouth. &ndash; BW</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Tony Ferguson: When it comes to being classified as a BMF, you should carry along a cool factor with your presence. Few fighters exude coolness and the violent ability to back it up in the cage more than &ldquo;El Cucuy&rdquo; Tony Ferguson. Victorious in his last 12 &ndash; TWELVE &ndash; UFC fights, Ferguson dazzles fans inside the Octagon by methodically brutalizing opponents with his well-rounded skills before putting things to bed. In the case of his last two fights against Donald &ldquo;Cowboy&rdquo; Cerrone and Anthony Pettis, the beatings were so profound that Ferguson wasn&rsquo;t afforded the choice to end the fight on his own terms, rather the decision was made for him via doctor and corner stoppages, respectively. The jaw-dropping win streak coupled with the devastation he&rsquo;s left in his wake has led Ferguson to the cusp of an elusive lightweight title shot against undefeated 155-pound king Khabib Nurmagomedov. Should Ferguson pass the Khabib test when these two do finally meet in the cage and bring a similar sort of brutality as he&rsquo;s done in the past, then it&rsquo;ll be hard to argue he can&rsquo;t even be No. 1 on this list. &ndash; JC</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Jorge Masvidal: It doesn&rsquo;t get much more badass than the man who coined the phrase &ldquo;three piece and a soda&rdquo; after getting into a scuffle backstage with Leon Edwards. Masvidal&rsquo;s history in the Octagon may not have come with the accolades of being a world champion, but &ldquo;Gamebred&rdquo; has proved time and again that he is about that life. Whether it was fighting in the backyards of Miami with his bare fists or sending Ben Askren to hell in five seconds with a flying knee, Masvidal&rsquo;s reputation proceeds him every time he fights. As he would say, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;super necessary.&rdquo; &ndash; BW</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nate Diaz: The originator of BMF had to rank high on the list. Diaz will sit on the sidelines for years out of principle. That principle: &ldquo;be real.&rdquo; Be real inside the cage and be real running your mouth outside of it. Diaz will piece you up on the feet, flip you the bird and flex while he has you locked in a choke and say something simple &ndash; but very cutting &ndash; after his hand is raised. Diaz is a marijuana-advocating, vegan-dieting, ass kicking, once-in-a-lifetime (with the exception of his brother) personality who defined this BMF thing. &ndash; BB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justin Gaethje: When Michael Johnson took shots at Gaethje ahead of their wild July 2017 clash, Gaethje said, &ldquo;This is not a game to me. Everything you&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve taken personal. It doesn&rsquo;t affect me emotionally. I wanted to kill him when the fight got announced and I want to kill him now. No more, no less. It&rsquo;s life or death for me every single time I step in the cage.&rdquo; He then knocked Johnson out. Just like he&rsquo;s knocked out 18 men in 21 career wins. Gaethje has seven post-fight bonuses in his time in the UFC, four Fight of the Night bonuses and three Performances of the Night. He has six UFC fights. A stone-cold killer attitude and more bonuses than fights? That&rsquo;s BMF elite. &ndash; BB</p>
</li>

<h3 id="the-rise-and-fall-of-the-hummer-americas-most-needlessly-masculine-vehicle">&ldquo;The rise and fall of the Hummer, America’s most needlessly masculine vehicle&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cq3AetqStgNM_HGYlo9el0VMEJA=/0x148:3000x1719/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19424603/GettyImages_88157856.jpg" alt="img">
It was June 1990 and Arnold Schwarzenegger was shooting Kindergarten Cop on location in Oregon. Given the actor’s preposterously prolific career as an action star in the ’90s, the film in which Schwarzenegger plays a police officer who reluctantly goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher could have been lost to time. That is, if it wasn’t for Schwarzenegger’s discovery of what would become an exceptional passion of his: a military-grade Humvee, the nearly 6,000-pound vehicle used by the armed forces.</p>
<p>“He just went ape for that machine,” said his agent, Lou Pitts, as quoted in the unauthorized biography Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger. “I mean, it was big, it was unique, and it was something that was larger than him.”</p>
<p>In this vehicle that dwarfed even the beefiest of men, Schwarzenegger saw a business opportunity. He contacted AM General, the heavy-automotive manufacturer behind the Humvee (the military vehicle on which the Hummer is based) and other purpose-driven vehicles, to communicate his adoration. He was sure the Hummer needed to be made available for purchase to regular people, and though the company was initially hesitant, the Hummer was introduced to the civilian market in 1992.</p>
<p>Though it wasn’t an immediate hit, the vehicle had become a cultural phenomenon by the early aughts. Its position as a symbol of early-2000s excess and militarist aesthetic obsession was cemented by its recession-induced demise: The last Hummer H3 was produced in May 2010. Until now.</p>
<p>In January 2020, General Motors Company announced it will launch the GMC Hummer EV — an electric vehicle, of all things. It will debut in May 2020, with an ad airing during the Super Bowl. It’s been a long road to get there.</p>
<p>Consumers took their time warming up to the car, as Jim Lynch, the owner of the first dealership to exclusively sell Hummers, remembers. “They’re rough around the edges,” Lynch says. “They were designed to be a military truck, and they were expensive and weren’t very refined.” Besides slapping in an air conditioning unit and a radio, AM General did very little to make the Hummer more accommodating for everyday users.</p>
<p>Even if they weren’t very practical, they were still widely coveted soon after launch. “I remember when I was a kid, you’d see a Hummer rarely and you would think, ‘That’s the biggest fucking thing I’ve seen before,’” says Doug DeMuro, an Autotrader editor and YouTuber with more than 3 million followers, recalling his awe for the car as a kid in the ’90s. In one video, DeMuro tours the 2006 H1 Alpha, pointing out its numerous quirks: an absence of airbags, a dinky steering wheel he compares to that of an arcade game, and hooks on the Hummer’s hood that allow it to be dropped from the sky by a helicopter. The selling point of the vehicle is its unparalleled abilities in off-roading, which necessitated its design, but it was impossible to have a car that maintained this ability and measured up to the average comfort standards for an everyday car.</p>
<p>In 1999, General Motors bought the brand from AM General and became responsible for its promotion, and that’s when the Hummer became unavoidable. The vehicle’s outlandishly masculine aesthetic made marketing rather simple for the company — all it had to do was prey on a man’s fear of being emasculated. The timing was particularly ripe for this marketing tactic: The word “metrosexual” had been coined in 1994, and the concept of a well-groomed, urbane man was cropping up in both brand campaigns and everyday conversation, threatening traditional masculinity.</p>
<p>“Perceiving the metrosexual as a mockery or threat to ‘real’ masculinity, some have tried to put the notion to rest,” Margaret Ervin writes in her essay “The Might of the Metrosexual,” published in the book Performing American Masculinities. “But the advent of the metrosexual heralds a very real change in the social construction of masculinity.” The creation of the label crumbled the long-held homogeneic idea of masculinity as an innate way of being for straight American men. As Ervin went on to explain, the admission that men could choose to be cultured and manicured implicitly meant that men were deciding to present as traditionally masculine; it wasn’t an inherent byproduct of having a Y chromosome and being heterosexual. “This marketed set of alternative identities for men — regular, badass, metrosexual — undermines the notion that masculinity is a natural, essential category,” Ervin writes.</p>
<p>In the wake of metrosexuality’s rise, men grasped for ways to prove their devotion to traditional masculinity. In 2006, Hummer ran an advertisement that focused on a man buying tofu and vegetables at the grocery store. He notices that the man behind him is buying massive piles of meat, clocks a Hummer ad on the back cover of a magazine next to the cash register, and races to a Hummer dealership after completing his purchase. “Restore the balance” was the ad’s tagline, which had been changed from the original — “reclaim your masculinity” — following criticism. The Hummer succeeded by making itself look like the obvious choice for heterosexual men.</p>
<p>From practically the outset of the Hummer’s availability to civilians and the coinage of “metrosexuality,” the vehicle’s link to traditional masculinity has been its main strength. As cited in The Hummer: Myths and Consumer Culture’s “Primordial Enchantment” essay, a ‘94 Forbes article purported that driving a Hummer will “inevitably … alter one’s hormonal balance,” allowing a man who had become softened by society to connect with his inner alpha male. In “Primordial Enchantment,” a piece that considers the media’s response to the Hummer, author Shane Gunster wrote of the intrinsic biological essentialism of the car’s marketing: “The rhetoric is that of emancipation, authenticity, and joyful regression: The aggressive behavior and atavistic fantasies inspired by the Hummer are applauded as expressive of the true needs and desires that stand at the core of what it means to be a ‘real’ man.”</p>
<p>The war on terror reinforced this anxiety and inspired men to gravitate toward traditional masculinity. In her 2007 book Terror Dream, author Susan Faludi cited Hollywood films, a Washington Post article on the “return of the alpha male,” and morning news segments following 9/11 in her documentation of this phenomenon. The same impulses that still lead fearful Americans to buy guns they’ll likely never need to use drove them to, well, drive Hummers. Whether you were a soccer mom looking to demonstrate your support for the troops while you picked up groceries or a middle-aged man wanting to show the public you weren’t ready to give in to the new masculinity, the Hummer did an adequate job of communicating your take on the cultural climate.</p>
<p>Shortly after 9/11, June 2002 saw the timely release of the Hummer H2. The H2’s redesign, for which it had GM to thank, meant it was more hospitable to the everyman, both in comfort and in aesthetic. The H1s looked more like something you’d find shrunken down and shelved next to a G.I. Joe doll in a toy shop — but the H2s were rounder and shinier, their magnitude more a symbol of early-aughts excess. Close to 12,000 H1s were sold between ’92 and ’06, but drivers rushed to dealerships for the H2, which sold more than 18,000 its first year in a huge jump for the Hummer line.</p>
<p>Elwood Watson, a professor at East Tennessee State University who has written about masculinity in academic publications, books, and for the Good Men Project website, sees the morphing nature of masculinity as being linked to the relative youth of America. Different contexts merit different gender expressions, he says, and compared to much older Latin American, African, and European nations that have more fixed ideas of masculinity, the US is still figuring out for what, exactly, its context calls. The nations that have more self-assured understandings of masculinity, Watson explains, ultimately create more relaxed environments for their men. Relative to other countries, American masculinity is a confused teenager, thrashing around in an attempt to find itself and feel understood. Watson credits the 21st century with major advances in the reshaping of masculinity, the most dramatic development being the dialogue surrounding toxic masculinity.</p>
<p>American masculinity is a confused teenager, thrashing around in an attempt to find itself and feel understood</p>
<p>The Hummer’s heft made it susceptible to criticism not only on an aesthetic basis, but also because its weight made it notoriously bad on gas mileage, and thus awful for the environment. In a study published in 2010, Marius Luedicke, Craig Thompson, and Markus Giesler examined the polarizing vehicle by interview interviewing owners and inspecting anti-Hummer forums, like fuH2.com.</p>
<p>“Interestingly, many Hummer owners I met cared deeply about the environment,” Luedicke tells me. “They only have an understanding of how the car contributes to pollution compared to a Prius. &hellip; Being accused of harming the environment made them laugh, as they thought the Prius driver does not understand the science, rather than reconsider their consumption choice.” Fans and owners of the vehicle ultimately found the image it evoked too alluring to prioritize its negative environmental impact.</p>
<p>The Hummer was a cartoonish relic of old masculinity that hadn’t yet stopped to second-guess itself. It was uselessly macho, even if the features were technically implemented with the intention to be useful; for most drivers, the knowledge of its ability was more alluring than actually putting it to use. The average American, like the average American car, will never really have to enter battle. The Hummer’s abilities became a marketing ploy: The vehicles were shown off-roading in commercials with the same wonder you might imagine in a spot for a children’s toy tank, followed by panning to the children residing over their toy set, playing God.</p>
<p>In 2005, when Doug DeMuro wrote a series for his column at Jalopnik in which he allowed his audience to vote on which car he would buy and drive for months, the overwhelming consensus was that he buy a Hummer. “I think for people who grew up in the ’90s, we’ve always found that car alluring,” DeMuro tells me, explaining his viewers’ attraction to it. “It was so big and so wide, and the military and all that. But nobody wants to personally own that. I think what drove them to recommend it to me was, ‘Hey, here’s our chance to find out what it’s like, but we don’t have to actually take the plunge to buy this ridiculous vehicle.’”</p>
<p>Along with the benefit to drivers who were less likely to grow weary of the uncomfortable car, its high sticker price and the cost of refueling made more sense for the wealthy. The problem with this? When the stock market crashed in 2008, the majority of people were suddenly worried about money. The Hummer was among the many victims of the Great Recession: GM filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the Hummer brand was dismantled the following year.</p>
<p>Since the last original Hummer came off of the production line, we’ve watched masculinity morph and create new dominant expressions. According to a 2011 study by Ilana Demantas, then a doctoral candidate at the University of Kansas, the recession’s greater effect on men meant many of them were left to reconsider how to define themselves when they were no longer the “breadwinner.” This shift naturally left many men embracing what was traditionally considered women’s work, as Demantas pointed out, thus altering the range of what masculinity could be.</p>
<p>The Hummer’s brand identity, more than mere sales numbers, is what made it a success in the early aughts. In the past decade, we’ve seen another car company’s branding propel it into popularity: the Tesla. The company’s branding has always pushed innovation and sustainability, an ideology completely opposed to the Hummer’s emphasis on traditional values and, more obviously, absolute disinterest in improving fuel efficiency. Along with the rise of the Tesla, there’s been a notable shift in the automobile industry toward SUVs, with SUVs and pickup trucks accounting for 70 percent of vehicle purchases in 2019, up from 53.2 percent in 2003. But despite the persistence of these gas guzzlers, the new electric Hummer coming in spring 2020 embraces the same kind of sustainable messaging as Tesla.</p>
<p>We still have Schwarzenegger driving his daughter to lunch in his Hummer, but maybe one day soon, they’ll all be making the switch to the Cybertruck — or the Hummer EV.</p>

<h3 id="the-12-best-found-footage-movies-ever-made-from-blair-witch-project-to-rec">&ldquo;The 12 Best Found Footage Movies Ever Made, From ‘Blair Witch Project’ to ‘REC’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/the-blair-witch-project1.jpg" alt="img">
What&rsquo;s more scary and more omnipresent than technology that can record every inch of the real world? Movies that act like it&rsquo;s all true. Here are a dozen.</p>
<p>Found footage films don’t exclusively belong to the horror arena — some film historians even posit that the first found footage film was an experimental joint by Shirley Clarke about drug addicts, certainly its own kind of horror story — but the technique has become so prevalent within the genre that it’s almost impossible to extricate them from each other. Horror filmmakers have always been canny creators, using what’s available to craft all manner of scares and, in the three decades since “The Blair Witch Project” changed the game, what’s become more scary and more omnipresent than technology that can record every inch of the real world?</p>
<p>And that’s the great trick of found footage: sometimes, just sometimes, if the films are really good and the people behind them are really adept at getting into the gag, they can convince their audience it truly is the “real world” they’re watching on the big screen. From an ill-fated movie that “ended” in a haunted forest to a suburban couple lost forever to dark forces, found footage is at its arguable best when toeing the line between fantasy and reality, bending it until it disappears.</p>
<p>Ahead, a dozen of the very best found footage movies ever made, from the standard-bearers like “Blair Witch” and “Cannibal Holocaust” to underseen low-budget wonders like “Lake Mungo” and “Willow Creek” to bonafide blockbusters like “Paranormal Activity” and “Cloverfield,” plus all sorts of chilling (and very, very “real”) treats in between.</p>

We&rsquo;ve rounded up 10 of the genre’s most iconic, chilling, and downright dastardly villains.</p>
<p>What’s a horror story without a boogeyman, a nefarious presence, a stone-cold killer with a plan, the bad guy just around the corner? Horror movies live and die (and sometimes, die and die and die) on the strength of their baddies, from masked murderers and supernatural beings to raging psychopaths and even the odd killer disease or two. Just who is knocking on your front door this spooky season? And why the hell would you answer?</p>

<h3 id="keanu-reeves-explained">&ldquo;Keanu Reeves, explained&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQ2m48Z1M1hm4pzwZ1ouyIfrJHQ=/0x322:4500x2678/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16500954/TED.jpg" alt="img">
It started in the pub, as all the best research does: Media studies professors Renee Middlemost (University of Wollongong) and Sarah Thomas (University of Liverpool) found themselves wondering where all the stars had gone. In 2019, in an age of fractured media landscapes and niche celebrities everywhere, does anyone in Hollywood have truly universal name recognition and appeal? Does there still exist a public figure whose persona can unite and speak to fragmented audiences without excluding or alienating anyone?</p>
<p>Tom Hanks, they asked? Nah, too rooted in nostalgia. Leonardo DiCaprio? Or Denzel Washington? Maybe, but can you see either of them playing to a crowd of people steeped in video games or YouTube culture? Will Smith or Samuel L. Jackson? While their careers span decades, neither of them seem to have the current cultural staying power they once did.</p>
<p>But what about Keanu?</p>
<p>Ding ding ding.</p>
<p>Keanu Reeves has long been an icon, but in 2019, in particular, he has reached a career peak — a period of activity that many are calling “the Keanaissance.” Pop culture has exploded with a new respect for him, at the precise moment that his career has been on an upswing. In 2019 alone, he’s had starring roles in films like John Wick 3, Always Be My Maybe, and Toy Story 4 and the forthcoming game Cyberpunk 2077; and been seen filming the upcoming, highly anticipated third sequel to 1989’s Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure. The Keanu resurgence has generated one think piece after another, each suggesting a culture enamored of his versatility and enduring career — but even more in love with his very human likability and relatability.</p>
<p>Keanu is a martial arts master, a romantic fantasy, a gaming hero, a relatable geek — one who’s reportedly in perpetual demand for superhero franchises — but he’s also still a fun-loving bro who sticks close to his bass-playing stoner roots. He’s even something of a Jesus figure, his renewed visibility reimagining him as a nigh-mythical force that has transcended any specific archetype. This year, Keanu has become a true everyman: an actor, and a meme, for all seasons.</p>
<p>But what makes Keanu so different, so likable? And why did it take so long for cultural recognition of his talents to shift toward profound respect? Why is it that Keanu’s moment is happening right now, and in full force?</p>
<p>Middlemost and Thomas embarked on a quest to find out. In July, they issued a call for papers to their academic journal, Celebrity Studies, for a special edition focused entirely on Keanu Reeves. At a glance, there’s plenty in his filmography to discuss; there may be no one else at Reeves’s level who’s appeared in such diverse, culturally dominant films over such a sustained period of time. Reeves has made his mark in every film genre — and most of that work has made him progressively more endearing as a talented, relatable, fun, even wholesome celebrity.</p>
<p>What’s notable about the list of themes and sample topics in Celebrity Studies’ call for papers, though, is how many of them have nothing to do with Keanu’s tremendous film output and everything to do with “Keanu” himself. There are requests for pieces on “tragic Keanu” and Keanu-as-meme; Keanu as “reluctant celebrity”; Keanu’s relationship to queer and Asian American identities; and one topic that just says “authenticity and ordinariness.”</p>
<p>All of this tells us it’s not just Keanu’s roles that have made him into 2019’s unexpected breakout wholesome star: It’s also his offscreen persona. On Twitter, for example, 250,000 follow the account Keanu Doing Things, while on Reddit, 300,000 people are devoted to celebrating his general awesomeness. There, you can find recent stories like Keanu helping a lost stranger find her way, Keanu leaping out of a car to sign a fan’s banner and then pose for family photos, Keanu secretly donating millions to charity, and Keanu being as humble now as he was nearly 30 years ago, before he’d had any huge hits to his name. No wonder a petition to name him Time’s Person of the Year currently has more than 150,000 signatures.</p>
<p>Clearly, we’re awaking to the discovery that the hero we needed has been among us all along — and what we learn about Keanu’s big 2019 moment can tell us a lot about the larger moment we’re in.</p>
<p>The seeds of Keanu’s current image were in his career all along</p>
<p>The Keanu we know today was with us from the very beginning — like the moment he drawled, “My daaaaad!” while beaming wholesomely at us in a 1983 Coke commercial, when he was just 18 years old. Here was an all-American boy who loved sports, loved his family, and, of course, loved Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Born in Lebanon in 1964 to an English mom and a Chinese-Hawaiian dad, Keanu eventually settled in Canada with his family and began acting at the ripe old age of 9. He made his (hilarious) screen debut at 16 as an extra in a Canadian sitcom and wound up riding horses and juggling as a teen reporter for the CBC, among other things. Here he is getting attacked by a teddy bear.</p>
<p>Nearly three decades later, it wouldn’t seem out of character for Keanu Reeves to get attacked by a teddy bear today. That’s what’s striking about all these early roles — just how Keanu they all are. The Keanu Reeves on display in these early segments is the Keanu Reeves we know and love today, someone characterized in large part by his goofy, self-effacing demeanor, uber-chill attitude, and slow drawl joined with weirdly perfect enunciation. Keanu rarely appears to be acting in these early segments and roles; he’s just being himself.</p>
<p>Keanu continued to offer an air of unique authenticity during his breakout role in 1988’s Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure — the movie that gave us an indelible image of Reeves as a blissed-out stoner within whom resides the ineffable wisdom of a philosopher. In retrospect, it’s clear to us that persona came both from the scripted role of Ted and from Keanu himself; we saw that same Zen energy, for example, in Reeves’s viral appearance on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show in May, where he took a question intended to lampoon his Unlikely Mystic persona and turned it on its head by taking it seriously.</p>
<p>And in a way, that tiny moment — when the audience sets out to laugh at Keanu and winds up appreciating him even more — is a microcosm of Reeves’s second life as a public figure.</p>
<p>The Matrix made us start taking Keanu seriously. And we never stopped.</p>
<p>Keanu’s role as unlikely purveyor of Zen wisdom got its ultimate boost from The Matrix. If 1994’s Speed, in which he starred as an imperturbable bomb squad cop, embodied the optimism and humanism of the ’90s, then 1999’s Matrix, along with other iconic films from that year like Fight Club and The Blair Witch Project, marked a turn toward new millennium-related unease. It also made Keanu Reeves even more relatable: There he was, stuck in the Matrix right alongside us, navigating a new era of technology and a host of looming existential questions.</p>
<p>The Matrix created a permanent link between Reeves and geek culture. His character, Neo, was the ultimate geek fantasy: an obscure office drone who morphs into a badass, leather-clad, kung-fu-fighting messiah. Because the Keanu we saw onscreen as Neo was so much like the reticent but philosophical geek we saw offscreen, it was easy, if you were a Matrix fan, to view Keanu as synonymous with his character — someone who was just like you but who had learned to manipulate and transcend the whole system, in his case by becoming the biggest action star there was while still retaining humility and grace.</p>
<p>While The Matrix inadvertently went on to become a tool for the most toxic internet communities, Keanu escaped all the contemporary negative associations we have with the film. Neo’s status as a Messianic figure, with all his innate spiritual wisdom, became associated with Keanu himself — and just as with Bill and Ted, it was impossible to know whether the role or the actor came first.</p>
<p>The increased focus on Keanu Reeves as a person superseded any discussion of whether he was a “good” or a “bad” actor. During the 1990s, when Keanu was still largely dismissed by the Hollywood establishment, he was in a string of flops and garnered three of his six Razzie nominations for Worst Actor and Supporting Actor. But by the aughts, it was becoming clear to all of us that Keanu Reeves doesn’t do “bad acting” or “good acting” but rather bends every part into the mystifying shape of Keanu. Is it intentional? Is it oblivious? It doesn’t matter; Keanu himself transcends the question of acting quality.</p>
<p>In 2005, Time observed of the Matrix star:</p>
<p>His voice has a certain forced, hollow depth, like a 12-year-old trying to sound grownup. His talent is hard to pin down, which is one reason a lot of critics think he doesn’t have any. But they’re wrong. &hellip; Something about that mysterious reserve, the total earnestness, the unwinking way he commits to the most absurd scenarios, makes free falls from planes and wire-fighting cyberninjastics feel like a philosophy lesson.</p>
<p>Thomas agrees that the biggest shift in Keanu’s cultural reception after the ’90s was in how seriously audiences now take his image. “The Zen-action guy image has absolutely been around for years,” she said in an email. “But running throughout public responses to Keanu during those younger years was also a sense of not really taking him seriously. It’s the idea of the ‘whoa’ persona, or in those debates about ‘how good an actor is he really,’ et cetera — that there was something dumb and silly about him and his characters. But that image has also slowly been interpreted as genuine, vulnerable, and authentic too.”</p>
<p>In other words, the Keanu Reeves of 1989, 2009, and 2019 are all, more or less, the same Keanu Reeves. He hasn’t changed; instead, 30 years after his career took off, the culture has finally caught up to the idea that the actor who embodies some of our most rigidly masculine cinematic tropes — the badass action hero, the unstoppable cop, the martial arts master, the guy who levels up to save the world and get the girl — can also be a gentle, soft-spoken, wholesome dude who eschews those tropes in his own life.</p>
<p>The audience’s awareness of Reeves’s authenticity grew throughout the aughts — in 2008, the Guardian labeled him a “Teflon thespian,” implying that he was incapable of losing the public’s love despite a wide-ranging number of roles. “A long, long time ago, those of us who love Keanu Reeves decided that no matter how many dismal movies like Johnny Mnemonic he made, and no matter how inept his acting in A Walk in the Clouds, and no matter how inappropriate his casting in Much Ado About Nothing and Bram Stoker’s Dracula, we would never stop being thrilled when news of an exciting new Keanu project was announced,” declared writer Joe Queenan. “There was something about Keanu Reeves that we liked, and nothing could ever change that.”</p>
<p>We saw that phenomenon play out earlier this year, when Reeves actually had the worst box office opening of his career to date — for Replicas, a movie no one’s heard of, even though it opened on more than 1,000 screens in January.</p>
<p>The box office failure didn’t seem to deter Reeves, though; his fandom seems to be completely divorced from his box office receipts at this point. That’s because of Keanu’s longest-lasting role, which began to take off in the earliest days of social media: Keanu as Meme.</p>
<p>Like all his roles, the meme version of Keanu and IRL Keanu fuel each other</p>
<p>Reeves’s saintliness was perhaps the earliest Keanu meme. Tales of his enormous generosity, alongside reports of him taking pay cuts and funding production budgets, became a self-perpetuating viral myth in the post-Matrix era. Like all Keanu’s real-life actions, these wound up fueling his meme persona; see this recently recirculated meme from 2008:</p>
<p>Keanu’s relatability, however, was what really put him on the meme map. Most famously came the Sad Keanu meme, which consists of a photograph, taken in 2010, showing Reeves eating a sandwich alone on a park bench. Not all of this was entirely invented by the internet; In 2011, Reeves coincidentally published Ode to Happiness, an illustrated book celebrating small ways of dealing with depression and melancholy. (The belief that Keanu is painfully lonely is sourced from a lie, but profiles implying that he does have issues with loneliness and depression have been with us for years.)</p>
<p>The Sad Keanu meme resonated because of its sincerity and, again, relatability: Keanu Reeves was just like us, eating a sandwich, lost in thought, having a bad day. The meme became so well-loved that it prompted the creation of Cheer Up, Keanu Day that same year. And it seemed to work: In 2011, Keanu was happy! Just like us!</p>
<p>Perhaps in conjunction with this positive counterpoint to the “Sad Keanu” meme, the 2010s began to proffer numerous stories of Reeves’s kindness, along with recirculating all the earlier stories of his on-set goodness and charity work. In 2011, he was spotted not only riding the subway like mere mortals but giving up his seat. Simultaneously, memes suggesting that Keanu was just like us in other ways began to circulate: Keanu is a geek, just like us; Keanu is humble, just like us; Keanu is perpetually respectful to women, as many of us would like to be. (He’s also immortal. Yeah, we can’t explain it either.)</p>
<p>“Publicly at least,” Thomas noted, “he’s not enamored by the trappings of fame — e.g., traveling on the subway, taking pay cuts, [being] bemused by his cultural resonance, etc.” Thomas sees this as a contrast to other examples of stardom that are “all about directly courting attention, fame, and materiality.” In other words, he’s wholesome. In a sea of wholesome memes, in fact, Keanu has somehow managed to transcend them all to become “the most wholesome person alive.”</p>
<p>The memetic amplification of Reeves’s good-guy real-life behavior has reached critical mass in 2019, in conjunction with his tremendous career revival — though for his part, he seems unaware of much of the buzz. He told People in June he had no idea he’d been dubbed “the internet’s boyfriend” and described the honor as “wacky,” before adding that “the positivity’s great.”</p>
<p>The moment is a handy encapsulation of the way his offscreen image has evolved through memes: He’s become someone who’s kind and generous but also someone who’s withdrawn, painfully human, self-aware about it, and still proactively seeking ways to be happy.</p>
<p>“In this contemporary media realm of very heightened performativity, construction and commodification of the ‘authentic’, those stories and images all appear to convey a lack of performance, construction, and a genuine sense of selfhood,” Thomas said. “I think that to many people, he can come to embody one of the closest examples of the authentic self and star image around.”</p>
<p>Thomas also notes that Reeves has a unique ability to embody two very different ends of the star spectrum — the affable nice guy and the aloof cool guy.</p>
<p>“Coolness and aloofness doesn’t always come with this sense of ‘niceness’, vulnerability, and approachability,” she wrote. “Someone like Steve McQueen was always ‘too cool’ to really be vulnerable and approachable; Will Smith is almost too approachable to really sell the idea of deadliness and hardness; Hugh Jackman can do both, but does not convey that shyness and has very much swung away from steeliness as he gets older; Paul Newman played around with the ordinariness/extraordinariness to extremes as well, but always conveyed confidence with both, which Keanu doesn’t.”</p>
<p>This paradoxical, memefied version of Keanu’s authenticity, mixed with his strange reserve, set the stage for the role Keanu has most recently embodied: the ever-cool, ever-tragic John Wick.</p>
<p>In the era of John Wick, all the Keanus have converged into one transcendent Every-Keanu</p>
<p>2014’s John Wick was an unlikely hit because of its mid-tier production budget, lack of a star ensemble, and absence of huge marketing campaign, but critics hailed it as a major triumph both for Keanu as the title character and anyone who liked sleek, pure, slickly choreographed action cinema. (The Razzies even offered him the Redeemer award for actors who’d turned around their Razzie-filled careers with a great performance.) More importantly, John Wick shared traits Keanu had become well-known for in his post-Matrix life: his dry humor and his slick, cool persona mingled with a real, relatable sense of personal loss and sadness — all these things were there, plus dogs!</p>
<p>“The ‘hardness and deadliness’ of Keanu has come with age,” Thomas told me. “It isn’t there before [John Wick] in the same ‘authentic’ way, and both screen roles and what we know of his persona life (the tragic aspects of it) combine to give a sense of this as a believable trait.”</p>
<p>These elements helped fuel the cult love of John Wick, and arguably boosted Reeves into the public’s consciousness yet again. The film’s following spread rapidly, and when John Wick: Chapter 2 appeared in 2017, the audience for it was there; critics raved about it, and the box office take doubled that of the first movie. “The film’s status as a ‘little one that could’, taking on bigger-budgeted and bigger-hyped films, really linked into the star’s identity of the underdog ‘good guy,’” Thomas argued. By now, as she notes, “questions of, ‘Is he a bad actor?’ have greatly diminished in favor of, ‘look at how he’s really [doing] all those stunts and choreography in the John Wick films, especially at his age!’”</p>
<p>But while age hasn’t slowed Reeves down, it’s lent an obvious nostalgic element to many of his roles, both past and present. 2018’s Destination Wedding reunited Reeves with Winona Ryder, whom he first co-starred with in 1992’s Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and got tongues wagging. Then there’s the highly anticipated third sequel to Bill and Ted, currently in production. What’s significant about these roles is that they’re actively nostalgic: Keanu is not a thing of the past, but rather an ongoing evolution. “He’s been around so long that he’s taken on a more symbolic meaning for audiences — connecting older ones with their own youths and reflecting on their own journeys through life and identity,” Thomas said.</p>
<p>In other words, the Keanu of the past is the Keanu of the present, and the Keanu of the present is also the Keanu of the real world as well as the Keanu of the screen. As GQ writer Alex Pappademas put it in his April profile of Reeves, “Every generation gets its own Keanu Reeves, except every generation’s Keanu Reeves is this Keanu Reeves.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Keanaissance, then, is arguably the convergence of all these different Keanus grabbing the spotlight before our eyes. First came the release of John Wick 3. Reeves’s subsequent cameo in Always Be My Maybe set the internet atwitter over his boyfriend potential. June saw the arrival of Toy Story 4, where he voices a motorcycle-riding showman named Duke Caboom. It also brought us the news that Reeves would star in the game Cyberpunk 2077; he showed up to E3 for the announcement like a god descending to earth. All of these things, combined with a series of offscreen viral moments and the revival of the “Keanu is awesome” meme, gave Reeves a renewed cultural omnipresence.</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, Keanu’s Asian American identity, subsumed through his longstanding branding as an essentially “white” actor, took center stage in 2019 with his casting in Always Be My Maybe, a film with a predominantly Asian cast. This reclamation of his racial identity, combined with his ongoing status as a queer icon, thanks to his early role in the cult classic My Own Private Idaho as well as queer and trans readings of several of his other films, has also made him a vital part of the recent conversation around Hollywood diversity.</p>
<p>Keanu is emblematic of our new interest in reevaluating and reassessing what we value most in our most beloved actors. As we embrace and encourage diversity onscreen and off, celebrate nostalgic cultural touchstones, and scrutinize everyone’s public and private lives, Keanu is suddenly directly at the center of the Venn diagram of what makes a truly likable celebrity in 2019.</p>
<p>Completely by chance, one film festival wound up capitalizing on the momentum around Keanu at its peak. In Glasgow, a local film association had planned a retrospective film festival devoted to the star, which had originally been scheduled to take place in September 2018, with organizers vowing to “trace his career from babe to Baba Yaga.”</p>
<p>But then a fire forced the organizers to move back the date of the planned “KeanuCon” all the way to April. When the con finally happened, it coincided with the huge wave of media interest and excitement surrounding Reeves.</p>
<p>“It’s been amazing to be a small part in this international explosion of Keanu fandom,” festival organizer Sean Welsh told me. “We had people travel from all over the UK and Europe to KeanuCon, and fans from across the world got in touch either begging for tickets or asking us to bring the festival to them next.”</p>
<p>Welsh speculated that the current wave of love for Keanu is due in large part to the public’s collective sense of camaraderie with him. “[He has] this communion with the audience that extends beyond [his] film roles.”</p>
<p>In other words, after a career full of one cultural ascension after another, from stoner mystic to mythical Jesus figure to badass action hero who just wants to be left alone to play with his dog, Keanu has now ascended to his final form by becoming an unlikely mythical Jesus figure himself. He simultaneously illuminates and evolves the very DNA of pop culture tropes while also bringing light to all who seek him — reminding us all that it’s still possible to be rich, powerful, and a self-aware good guy. Who also knows kung fu.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it was really only a matter of time before he ascended to internet godhood,” Welsh told me. “We probably only have a couple of years before he sheds his corporeal form to travel the cosmos as a boundless and benevolent emissary of humanity.”</p>
<p>Go forth, Keanu. Go forth.

Ask the average person to name a famous scientist and they might recall Charles Darwin or Albert Einstein, titans from history. Or, if they are thinking more currently, they might name astronomer Carl Sagan, pop astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson or linguist Noam Chomsky. Chemist and physicist Marie Curie may even make the list, but how many scientists who are women spring easily to mind?</p>
<p>It was a woman, after all, who discovered the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. That was French virologist Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, co-winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. A woman also coined the term &ldquo;computer bug&rdquo; and led the team that developed the first computer language compiler—a program that translates human-created programming language to machine language the computer can understand. That was Grace Hopper, a computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral.</p>
<p>Women have made many fundamental contributions to science, technology, engineering and math—the STEM fields—but too often either chance or bias keeps them from achieving the acclaim of their male peers.</p>
<p>Neuroscientist and designer Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya wants to change that. With her project &ldquo;Beyond Curie: Celebrating Badass Women in Science,&rdquo; she aims to elevate the visibility of 16 Nobel Prize winners and 16 other &ldquo;lady bosses who have accomplished extraordinary things,&rdquo; she writes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beyond Curie&rsquo; is a celebration of the rich history of women kicking ass in STEM fields,&rdquo; she says. She is giving 32 women an illustration that features their portraits as well as images and design elements connected to their groundbreaking work.</p>
<p>The images have strong, clean lines and bold colors. Phingbodhipakkiya explains that including the women&rsquo;s faces was important to her. She wanted to show the human side of science.</p>
<p>The project’s launch coincided with Women&rsquo;s History Month, but its relevance is evergreen. Although great strides have been made in gender equality in the past century, sexism still tips the scales against women.</p>
<p>A study published in October 2016 revealed that women in geoscience were half as likely to receive excellent recommendation letters as men. Scientific journals disproportionately choose men to review articles to be published by other researchers, an important career-building activity for scientists. In 2013, Nature pointed out that even though about half of those earning doctorate degrees in science and engineering are female, only one-fifth of full professorships are held by women. Persistent pay inequality, a lack of role models to emulate and unconscious bias in hiring are just a few potential causes, writes journalist Helen Shen for Nature.</p>
<p>For women of color the barriers to a career in science are even higher, according to a 2015 report. Also, even with greater public acceptance in the U.S., many LGBT scientists are reluctant to come out in the workplace, reports M. Mitchell Waldrop for Nature.</p>
<p>The message of findings like these is that representation is important. &ldquo;We need to show everyone that our world was built by brilliant women, not just by men, and by people of all backgrounds,&rdquo; Phingbodhipakkiya says.</p>
<p>The designer leverages her own background in science and research to inform and inspire others. After the 2016 election, she felt a keen need to use her expertise and came up with the idea for this design project. &ldquo;Visibility for women in STEM is so important, especially now,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The project is a way to inspire the next generation of girls to go into a STEM field. It is a way to remind everyone that there are extraordinary women out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the project&rsquo;s website, short biographies detailing each woman&rsquo;s triumphs and challenges accompany a page dedicated their illustration.</p>
<p>In one illustration, Katherine Johnson, the &ldquo;human computer&rdquo; whose achievements were recently portrayed in the movie Hidden Figures, bends her head intently over her calculations. Behind her the number 11 rises triumphantly into a black background like a rocket taking off. The number is inscribed with the word &ldquo;apollo&rdquo; to pay homage to Johnson&rsquo;s calculations, which were critical to the 1969 Apollo 11 mission to the moon.</p>
<p>Barré-Sinoussi gazes intently from the corner of her illustration, sharing space on a purple background with stylized representations of the virus she discovered. Chinese-American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu looks just past the viewer with the barest hint of a smile in her illustration, flanked by three vertical lines of gold and two dark spheres that hint at the elegant experiments she designed to help prove how at a subatomic level nature is not quite symmetrical.</p>
<p>Phingbodhipakkiya combed the Internet for good images to go with her illustrations and then created a kind of digital collage using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. She tried to find portraits of the women when they were making their discoveries.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Beyond Curie&rdquo; message resonated. On Kickstarter, 602 people supported the project, raising more than $32,000. Phingbodhipakkiya pledged that every dollar raised above her own production costs would go toward the Association for Women in Science.</p>
<p>Supporters wrote to Phingbodhipakkiya as the Kickstarter campaign played out. She shared some of those responses:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[W]hen I saw your project, I couldn&rsquo;t think of many female scientists beyond Marie Curie and that hit me like a punch to the gut,&rdquo; wrote a veterinarian studying for her doctorate in pathology. &ldquo;It shocked me, it made me sad and then, it kinda made me angry! Projects like this make me proud to be in science.&rdquo; She added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of many of these women&rsquo;s discoveries, but not that it was a woman who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another wrote that she had been working as a computer programmer for more than 25 years. &ldquo;Even after all these years, I desperately need to be able to know these women, as my own inspiration to keep going,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Phingbodhipakkiya says these messages buoyed her as she crafted each illustration. Before the campaign ended, she had already posted 20 of the 32 illustrations to her Instagram.</p>
<p>Six illustrations are featured as posters and include text about the upcoming March for Science. The march, planned for April 22, has a plethora of stated goals, writes Ed Yong for The Atlantic. But the themes include the intent to celebrate science, advocate for its funding and inspire future investigators, inventors and researchers, including those from &ldquo;historically underrepresented groups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Design was such a big part of galvanizing people to come out for the Women&rsquo;s March,&rdquo; Phingbodhipakkiya says, referring to the posters marchers toted for the January 2017 march and the visual impact of thousands wearing knitted pink hats. She hopes people will download and carry her women in science posters for the upcoming demonstration. &ldquo;Design can change behavior,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>The 32 illustrations of &ldquo;Beyond Curie&rdquo; will live online once Phingbodhipakkiya completes them. She&rsquo;s also looking into possibilities to have a physical exhibit, a book or a multi-media collaboration to make sure more people can meet these hardworking female pioneers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think having a room full of these women looking back at you would be really powerful,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The portrait of a woman is just as important as the portrait of a man.&rdquo;</p>
