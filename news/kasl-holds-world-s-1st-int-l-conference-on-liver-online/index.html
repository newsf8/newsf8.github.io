&ndash;Sustained progress across clinical development programs spanning liver, retinal and metabolic diseases and cancer&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;Aldafermin continues to advance toward late-stage clinical development in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with ongoing Phase 2b ALPINE 2/3 and ALPINE 4 clinical studies&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;Initiated Phase 2 CATALINA study of NGM621, a complement C3 inhibitory antibody to treat patients with geographic atrophy (GA)&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;$312.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2020&ndash;</p>
<p>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Aug. 12, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &ndash; NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NGM) (Nasdaq: NGM), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing transformative therapeutics for patients, today provided business highlights and reported financial results for the period ending June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>“We continue to progress across our clinical-stage programs spanning liver, retinal and metabolic diseases as well as cancer, despite the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to the dedication and tireless efforts of our team, and the ongoing support and commitment from our clinical collaborators,” said David J. Woodhouse, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at NGM. “We’re thrilled to have achieved our most recent clinical milestone, the advancement of NGM621 into Phase 2 development for the treatment of patients with GA. GA is a highly prevalent and progressive retinal degenerative disease that can have a devastating, irreversible impact on patients’ vision and quality of life. Based on NGM621’s novel profile as a complement C3 inhibitory monoclonal antibody, we believe it has the potential to be an important treatment option for this significantly underserved patient population. It is gratifying to now have two programs in Phase 2 clinical development in two distinct therapeutic areas, both for the treatment of serious unmet needs.”</p>
<p>Dr. Woodhouse further commented, “Within the diverse NASH development landscape, we are pleased with the impressive and highly consistent clinical performance of aldafermin to date, with robust, placebo-controlled data demonstrating statistically significant dual activity in reversing fibrosis and resolving NASH. Our Phase 2b ALPINE 2/3 and ALPINE 4 clinical studies remain on track, and we are hard at work on Phase 3 readiness in anticipation of an ALPINE 2/3 topline data readout in the first half of next year.”</p>
<p>Key Second Quarter and Recent Highlights</p>
<p>Liver and metabolic disease</p>
<p>Continued enrollment in Phase 2b ALPINE 2/3 study of aldafermin in NASH. NGM has continued enrollment in the Phase 2b ALPINE 2/3 clinical study of aldafermin in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and stage 2 or 3 (F2-F3) liver fibrosis. The 24-week study is designed to enroll approximately 150 patients and will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 0.3 mg, 1 mg and 3 mg doses of aldafermin compared to placebo. Enrollment activities have increased since our first quarter update, and we reiterate our expectation of announcing topline data from the study in the first half of 2021.</p>

Enrollment activities have increased since our first quarter update, and we reiterate our expectation of announcing topline data from the study in the first half of 2021. Continued enrollment in Phase 2b ALPINE 4 study of aldafermin in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis . NGM has continued enrollment in the Phase 2b ALPINE 4 study of aldafermin in patients with biopsy-confirmed compensated NASH cirrhosis (F4). The 48-week study is designed to enroll approximately 150 patients and will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 0.3 mg, 1 mg and 3 mg doses of aldafermin compared to placebo.</p>
<p>. NGM has continued enrollment in the Phase 2b ALPINE 4 study of aldafermin in patients with biopsy-confirmed compensated NASH cirrhosis (F4). The 48-week study is designed to enroll approximately 150 patients and will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 0.3 mg, 1 mg and 3 mg doses of aldafermin compared to placebo. Data from 24-week double‑blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study (Cohort 4) of aldafermin in NASH patients published in Gastroenterology. Comprehensive findings and analysis from the 24-week Cohort 4 reported by NGM in February 2020 were published this month in the journal Gastroenterology. The 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study demonstrated statistically significant dual activity in reversing fibrosis and resolving NASH. In the study, aldafermin continued to demonstrate a favorable tolerability profile. Cohort 4 was the final reported cohort from NGM’s adaptive Phase 2 clinical study of aldafermin in NASH, and the results observed in Cohort 4 were consistent with data from the three previous cohorts.</p>

Continued enrollment in Phase 1 study of NGM395 in overweight and obese healthy adults. NGM has continued to enroll patients in a Phase 1 single ascending dose clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NGM395, a long-acting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) analog, in overweight and obese but otherwise healthy adults.</p>
<p>NGM has continued to enroll patients in a Phase 1 single ascending dose clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NGM395, a long-acting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) analog, in overweight and obese but otherwise healthy adults. Completed Phase 1 study of NGM217 in adults with autoimmune diabetes. We recently completed a Phase 1 study of NGM217, an antibody binding an undisclosed target, which assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NGM217 in adults with autoimmune diabetes. The study demonstrated that NGM217 was well tolerated. However, as NGM continues to advance multiple clinical‑stage programs and anticipates advancing earlier-stage discovery programs into clinical development, the company has decided to suspend activities related to NGM217 to concentrate its resources on the development of other product candidates.</p>
<p>Retinal disease</p>
<p>Initiated Phase 2 CATALINA study of NGM621 in patients with GA. As announced in July 2020, NGM initiated the Phase 2 CATALINA study, a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal injections (IVT) of NGM621 in patients with GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Dysregulated activation of the complement system, a key component of the immune system, has been implicated in the onset and progression of GA. NGM621 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody engineered to potently inhibit activity of complement C3 with the treatment goal of reducing disease progression in patients with GA, and with the potential for extended every eight week dosing without PEGylation. Designed as a Phase 3-enabling study, the Phase 2 CATALINA study is expected to enroll 240 patients diagnosed with GA in one or both eyes.</p>
<p>NGM also successfully completed a first-in-human open-label Phase 1 study in which treatment with single- and multiple-dose IVT injections of NGM621 in patients with GA was well tolerated, supporting advancement to the Phase 2 CATALINA study. NGM plans to present the data from the Phase 1 study at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2020 Virtual Annual Meeting from November 13-15, 2020. In addition, NGM presented NGM621 preclinical findings at The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting, held virtually in June 2020. The presentations are available on NGM’s website.</p>
<p>Cancer</p>
<p>Continued enrollment in Phase 1a/1b study of NGM120 in patients with cancer anorexia/cachexia syndrome (CACS) and cancer. NGM continues to enroll patients in a Phase 1a/1b clinical study to evaluate NGM120, a first-in-class antagonistic antibody that binds glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like (GFRAL), and inhibits GDF15 signaling, for the potential treatment of CACS and cancer. CACS is the uncontrolled wasting of both skeletal muscle and fat that is a common co-morbidity of cancer and is associated with shortened survival in cancer patients.</p>
<p>Corporate</p>
<p>Expanded leadership with key management team and board appointments. NGM announced the appointment of a new executive team member, Siobhan Nolan Mangini, as Chief Financial Officer effective July 13, 2020 and announced the appointment of Carole Ho, M.D. to its Board of Directors. Dr. Ho currently serves as Chief Medical Officer and Head of Development at Denali Therapeutics.</p>
<p>Merck Collaboration</p>
<p>Merck has a one-time option to license NGM pipeline programs, other than NGM’s wholly-owned programs aldafermin and NGM395, following human proof-of-concept trials under the terms of the companies’ ongoing strategic collaboration. Upon exercising any such option, Merck would lead global product development and commercialization for the resulting products, if approved. Prior to Merck initiating a Phase 3 study for a licensed program, NGM may elect to either receive milestone and royalty payments or, in certain cases, to co-fund development and participate in a global cost and revenue share arrangement of up to 50%. The agreement also provides NGM with the option to participate in the co-promotion of any co-funded program in the United States. In January 2019, Merck exercised its first option under the collaboration to license NGM313, also referred to as MK‑3655.</p>
<p>Second Quarter Financial Results</p>
<p>For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, NGM reported a net loss of $25.6 million compared to a net loss of $7.7 million for the corresponding period in 2019.</p>
<p>Related party revenue from our collaboration with Merck for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was $19.8 million compared to $25.3 million for the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in related party revenue was primarily attributable to the completion of all remaining obligations associated with the upfront payment at the conclusion of the initial five-year term of the Merck collaboration.</p>
<p>Research and development expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 were $38.5 million compared to $28.8 million for the corresponding period in 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was mainly attributable to increases in external research and development expenses associated with the advancement of NGM’s growing pipeline, primarily expenses related to our aldafermin, NGM621 and NGM395 programs, and personnel-related expenses driven by increased headcount.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 were $6.8 million compared to $6.2 million for the corresponding period in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in personnel-related expenses driven by increased headcount and legal expenses to support our operations as a public company.</p>
<p>Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities were $312.1 million as of June 30, 2020, compared to $344.5 million as of December 31, 2019.</p>

After Darren Demeterio was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer last year, a scan in June detected a new cancerous spot on his liver. His doctor told him to to eat healthily and stay positive.</p>
<p>But right now it’s hard for him to do either: Since Tropical Storm Isaias battered the New York region, he has been without power for nearly a week at his suburban home.</p>
<p>There is no electricity to refrigerate fruits, vegetables, fish or chicken, so his wife has taken trips to the grocery store every day. With temperatures rising, and no way to keep cool, Mr. Demeterio, 49, is scared.</p>
<p>“The last week has been such a nightmare you can’t get away from,” said Mr. Demetrio, who lives in Tarrytown, about 25 miles north of Manhattan. “Normally for me, you keep yourself occupied so you’re not thinking negatively. Unfortunately, there’s no way around that now.”

<h3 id="akero-therapeutics-reports-second-quarter-2020-financial-results">&ldquo;Akero Therapeutics Reports Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.stockhouse.com/kentico-cms/0242-00/images/stockhouse-logo-og.png" alt="img">
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKRO), a cardio-metabolic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) company developing pioneering medicines designed to restore metabolic balance and improve the overall health of NASH patients, today reported second quarter financial results for the period ending June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the second quarter of 2020, we reported the first histological results for our FGF21 analog, efruxifermin (EFX), formerly AKR-001. We observed improvements in histological parameters of NASH after only 16 weeks of treatment, the magnitude of which is among the highest observed to date across the NASH field, despite other compounds having been evaluated for 24 to 78 weeks. These results have increased our confidence in EFX&rsquo;s potential to become a foundational NASH monotherapy,&rdquo; said Andrew Cheng, M.D., Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Akero. &ldquo;We believe positive histological data in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients could be a prerequisite for the FDA to define a registrational development path for any investigational NASH compound. We look forward to discussing our development path with the FDA and advancing a potentially promising therapy for patients, if our development plan is approved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control, weight loss and lipoproteins were also observed in the main BALANCED study. &ldquo;The significant reductions in HbA1c and body weight we observed in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients following EFX treatment were firsts for an FGF21 analogue,&rdquo; said Tim Rolph, D.Phil., chief scientific officer of Akero. &ldquo;Although various preclinical models have shown FGF21 improves glycemic control and weight loss, these improvements have not translated to humans with prior FGF21 analogs. We believe the clinical results observed for EFX can be attributed to EFX&rsquo;s unique engineering, based on pioneering discoveries that enabled the pharmacology of human FGF21 to be reproduced in a long acting FGF21 analog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second Quarter Business Highlights</p>
<p>The Company reported secondary and exploratory histology results following 16 weeks of treatment with EFX. Of the 40 biopsy-confirmed NASH patients treated with EFX who had end-of-treatment biopsies:</p>
<p>48% achieved at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH;</p>
<p>28% achieved at least a two-stage improvement in fibrosis;</p>
<p>48% achieved NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis; and</p>
<p>28% achieved both NASH resolution and at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis.</p>
<p>These results build on the significant 12-14% absolute reductions (corresponding to 63-72% relative reductions) in liver fat, in each case compared with 0% for placebo. Reductions of 24-32 U/L were observed for ALT, a validated marker of liver damage, compared with 6 U/L for placebo.</p>
<p>The Company also reported multiple exploratory endpoints for various biomarkers. Results for patients treated with EFX for 16 weeks include:</p>
<p>Significant absolute reductions of 0.4% and 0.5% in HbA1c for the 50 and 70mg dose groups, respectively, compared to a 0.1% increase for placebo;</p>
<p>Absolute reductions of 2.3kg and 3.7kg in body weight for the 50 and 70mg dose groups, with the latter attaining significance, compared with an increase of 0.1kg for placebo;</p>
<p>Significant 37-45% relative reductions in plasma triglycerides, compared with an 8% increase for placebo;</p>
<p>Significant 32-40% relative increases in HDL cholesterol, compared with no change for placebo;</p>
<p>Significant 13-20% relative reductions in non-HDL cholesterol, compared with no change for placebo; and</p>
<p>No increase in LDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>On June 16 th , the Company dosed its first patient in an expansion cohort of the BALANCED study, Cohort C, which is designed to assess safety and tolerability of treatment with EFX in NASH patients who have compensated cirrhosis (F4), Child-Pugh Class A. The Company expects the results of Cohort C to inform the long-term development plan for this patient population, which is at greatest risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease.</p>

<p>About NASH</p>
<p>NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) is a serious form of NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and is estimated to affect 17 million Americans. NASH is closely linked to the obesity and diabetes epidemics seen around the world. NASH is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver that causes stress and injury to liver cells, leading to inflammation and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and eventually death. The progressive damage to the liver associated with NASH resembles the pathology associated with excessive alcohol consumption or viral infections. As a result, NASH has become a leading cause of liver transplants in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>About efruxifermin</p>
<p>Efruxifermin (EFX), formerly AKR-001, is Akero&rsquo;s lead product candidate for NASH. Efruxifermin was designed to increase insulin sensitivity, improve lipoproteins, reduce liver fat and inflammation, and reverse fibrosis. This holistic approach offers the potential to address the complex, multi-organ/tissue pathogenesis of NASH, including improvements in risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease – the leading cause of death in NASH patients. Engineered to mimic the biological activity profile of native human FGF21, efruxifermin offers convenient once-weekly dosing.</p>
<p>About Akero Therapeutics</p>
<p>Akero is a cardio-metabolic NASH company dedicated to reversing the escalating NASH epidemic by developing pioneering medicines designed to restore metabolic balance and improve overall health of NASH patients. The Company&rsquo;s lead product candidate, efruxifermin, has been evaluated in a 16-week Phase 2a clinical trial, the BALANCED study. Akero Therapeutics is headquartered in South San Francisco, CA.

<h3 id="strong-link-found-between-abnormal-liver-tests-and-poor-covid-19-outcomes">&ldquo;Strong link found between abnormal liver tests and poor COVID-19 outcomes&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Researchers at the Yale Liver Center found that patients with COVID-19 presented with abnormal liver tests at much higher rates than suggested by earlier studies. They also discovered that higher levels of liver enzymes &ndash; proteins released when the liver is damaged &ndash; were associated with poorer outcomes for these patients, including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death.</p>
<p>The study appeared online on July 29 in Hepatology.</p>
<p>Previous studies in China found that approximately 15% of patients with COVID-19 had abnormal liver tests. The Yale study, which looked retrospectively at 1,827 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Yale New Haven Health system between March and April, found that the incidence of abnormal liver tests was much higher &ndash; between 41.6% and 83.4% of patients, depending on the specific test.</p>
<p>In all, the Yale researchers examined five liver tests, looking at factors such as elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), which indicate liver cell inflammation; an increase in bilirubin, which indicates liver dysfunction; and increased levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which may indicate inflammation of bile ducts.</p>
<p>Although the researchers do not know why the incidence of abnormal liver tests was so much higher than in previous studies from China, senior author Dr. Joseph Lim, professor of medicine and director of the Yale Viral Hepatitis Program, said other health differences between the Chinese and U.S. populations could account for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can speculate that U.S. patients may have an increased rate of other risk factors such as alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>Liver disease is widespread in the U.S. population. Dr. Michael Nathanson, the Gladys Phillips Crofoot Professor of Medicine (digestive diseases), professor of cell biology, director of the Yale Liver Center, and a co-author of the study, said: &ldquo;In the U.S., close to one-third of people have fatty liver disease, and several million people have chronic hepatitis B or C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because the Yale researchers had access to patients' health records, they were also able to look at their liver tests prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Approximately one-quarter of patients in the study had abnormal liver tests prior to being admitted for the virus. But regardless of whether patients came to the hospital with existing liver problems or developed them during their COVID-19-related hospitalization, a strong association was observed between abnormal liver tests and the severity of the COVID-19 cases, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Rather than the liver itself driving poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the organ is more likely &ldquo;a bystander&rdquo; affected by the hyperinflammation associated with COVID-19 and by the side effects of related treatments, Nathanson said.</p>
<p>The study noted a relationship between drugs used to treat severe COVID-19 and liver damage, most significantly the drug tocilizumab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We observed a strong association between the use of COVID-19 medications and abnormal liver tests,&rdquo; said Lim, but added that they could not confidently tease out that the abnormal tests were due to &ldquo;drug-induced liver injury&rdquo; as opposed to the disease.</p>
<p>The researchers have additional clinical and lab-based studies underway to further understand COVID-19&rsquo;s impact on liver pathology. Nathanson noted that as one of only four National Institutes of Health-sponsored liver centers in the country, the Yale Liver Center is uniquely positioned to advance this research.</p>
<p>Additional Yale researchers involved in the study include lead author and internal medicine resident Dr. Melanie Hundt; biostatistician Yanhong Deng, co-director of analytics at the Yale Center for Analytical Sciences; and Maria Ciarleglio, associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health.
