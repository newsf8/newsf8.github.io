A meat-eating dinosaur with a feathered body, iron grip and a tail for agile pursuit of prey, has been discovered by fossil hunters, revealing that raptor dinosaurs were thriving right up to the point the asteroid struck, 66m years ago.</p>
<p>The remains, comprising about 20 bones, were found in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, in rocks dating to about 67m years ago. They are believed to be from a type of dromaeosaurid – a family of theropod dinosaurs that includes raptors – which appears to have been a close cousin of the velociraptor.</p>
<p>Dubbed Dineobellator notohesperus – a nod to the indigenous people of the region, the Navajo, the latin word for warrior and the south-western US location it was found in – the animal would have been about two metres in length, weighed about 18-22kg, and been covered in feathers.</p>
<p>Researchers say the fossils show a number of unusual features. “The upper arm bone has a very distinct angle in it, and basically what that means is that muscles attaching there would have been more efficient than other [dromaeosaurids],” said Dr Steven Jasinski, of the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the research.</p>
<p>“[That] would have allowed muscles of a similar size to be stronger and do more work more quickly in this animal.”</p>
<p>The animal’s claws also showed large projections on their bottom side, where muscles and tendons would have attached. “They are especially large, which would have given this animal a really strong grip and ability to grasp things with both its hands and feet,” said Jasinski.</p>
<p>And while many dromaeosaurids had stiff, reinforced tails that acted as a counterbalance, helping the animals run fast while low to the ground, the newly discovered beast had an extra feature: mobility.</p>
<p>“The one major thing that is different about Dineobellator is that at the base of the tail, the vertebrae are set up differently so it makes the tail highly mobile at the base,” said Jasinski. That, he added, means the dinosaur would have been able to whip its stiff tail around while pursing zig-zagging prey, meaning it was not only a nippy predator, but agile to boot.</p>
<p>While the final moments of Dineobellator are lost to time, the team found a gouge in one of the animal’s claws that appears to have been made around the time of its death – suggesting the beast may have met a sticky end. “We speculate an altercation with another Dineobellator or other predatory theropod resulted in these marks,” they write.</p>
<p>Jasinksi noted that while dromaeosaurids were present in both Asia and North America about 125m years ago, there are few fossils from the period that followed, with more recent remains discovered primarily in Asia.</p>
<p>“It looks like the ancestors of Dineobellator would have basically migrated from Asia and then diversified once they got back to North America at the very end of the Cretaceous, right before they went extinct,” said Jasinski.</p>
<p>Jasinski said the findings emphasised there was still considerable diversity before the mass extinction, despite some arguing that dinosaurs were in decline. “It shows dromeosaurids were still basically evolving, they were still trying out new evolutionary pathways, new features, up to the very end,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, agreed, adding that Dineobellator is the best fossil raptor dinosaur from southern North America during the very end of the age of dinosaurs, and one of the last surviving raptors.</p>
<p>“In fact, it seems like there were many types of raptors in North America at this time, so they were really prospering,” he said.</p>
<p>The creature would have been fearsome, he added. “If you saw it alive, Dineobellator would have looked like a weird, long-tailed, toothy bird – but one that could chase you down on foot and gut you with its claws.”

Is that a dinosaur? Inside Boulder Junior Cycling’s Strava art challenge</p>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s Boulder Junior Cycling holds a Strava art challenge to keep things fun.</p>
<p>After just one week of spring practice, Colorado’s Boulder Junior Cycling (BJC) program was faced with the mounting coronavirus pandemic. Schools across Colorado were emptied, the major races were canceled, and the 2020 racing season was called off. The dozens of teenagers in the program were left with few goals to strive for, which meant coaches had to get creative.</p>
<p>“Some kids are really, really bummed,” said BJC Executive Director Pete Weber. “They had big dreams for the season. So, we’ve been continuing to operate the team virtually. We have a lot of programming to keep the kids engaged.”</p>

<p>The leadership team at BJC wanted to keep kids engaged, even if that meant going virtual. Like scores of students and professionals across the globe, BJC athletes are now communicating with each other and their coaches via virtual platforms like Zoom and Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>Colorado rules still permit residents to exercise outdoors, so long as they follow the appropriate guidelines of physical distancing. This means that some BJC kids are still doing what they love: riding bikes. It also means that their coaches have an opportunity to keep programming fun and fresh. Last week, coaches asked riders to snap and submit photos taken during training rides.</p>
<p>This week, BJC’s riders received a new challenge from coaches: A Strava art challenge. Kids were encouraged to use their rides to sketch out pictures on their respective Strava accounts.</p>
<p>Weber says he was expecting some simple geometric designs or a few letters. The pictures the kid submitted were far more complex.</p>
<p>There’s a picture of a dinosaur, one of the ski boot in a ski binding, and the Colorado state flag, among other designs. We are impressed.

The sheer size of some dinosaurs has captured our imagination from the very beginning. And since that time, paleontologists have engaged in more than a little of the “my dinosaur is bigger than yours” contest. The question is how big the biggest ones really got.</p>
<p>For a time, the title-holder seemed to be a long-necked dinosaur called Amphicoelias fragillimus. In life, the dinosaur might have stretched over 200 feet long, making it almost twice the length of the closest contenders. The trouble is that the bone used to name this dinosaur was lost long ago, and more recent analyses have shrunk the size estimates.</p>
<p>This is actually something of a common problem among the biggest of the big. They were so huge that they weren’t buried quickly — and, therefore, much of their bodies decayed. The largest dinosaurs are often known from scraps or partial skeletons, and sometimes these pieces go missing.</p>
<p>But there’s no shortage of sauropods lining up for a crack at the superlative. At present, the race seems neck-and-neck between Argentinosaurus and Patagotitan. Both are estimated to have been over 100 feet long and weighed in excess of 90 tons. And both are known from incomplete material that doesn’t entirely overlap. They’re right in the same ballpark, with the winner decided by pounds and inches.</p>
<p>There’s always the possibility that an even larger giant will emerge. But, for the moment, the error bars will have to remain on any aspiring claimant to the “Biggest Dinosaur Ever” title.</p>
