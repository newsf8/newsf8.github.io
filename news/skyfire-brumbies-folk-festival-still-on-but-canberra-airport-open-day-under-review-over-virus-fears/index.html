<p>coronavirus, canberra coronavirus, covid-19, national folk festival, coronavirus</p>
<p>Health authorities have given the go-ahead for Canberra&rsquo;s biggest mass gathering, Skyfire, to take place on Saturday night, with, as of Wednesday, not one coronavirus case diagnosed in the territory. The ACT government said on Wednesday with no confirmed cases of the virus, there was no need to cancel events and Canberrans should go about their daily lives and &ldquo;enjoy what Canberra has to offer&rdquo;. The main advisory committee to the federal government continues to suggest that the risk to the general population from COVID-19 is low and &ldquo;public events should proceed&rdquo;. But it also suggests people who are unwell with a cough or fever, especially if they have travelled overseas recently, should steer clear of major public events. Skyfire, Canberra&rsquo;s much-loved fireworks spectacular, is expected to attract 100,000 people to the shores of Lake Burley Griffin on Saturday. It comes as the National Folk Festival says the event will go ahead as usual this Easter in Canberra, even as large-scale arts events interstate and overseas have been disrupted due to concerns around the spread of the virus. Tasmania&rsquo;s winter arts festival Dark Mofo, due to take place in June, has been cancelled while the iconic music festival Coachella in southern California has been moved from April to October. The folk festival says it will introduce extra safety measures such as additional hand-sanitation areas but it will otherwise continue at Exhibition Park in Canberra from April 9 to 13. However, the Canberra Airport is a reviewing its popular open day, due to be held on April 5, with a decision to be made next week. But the big Brumbies versus Waratahs rugby game, always a big drawcard in the national capital, is going ahead on Sunday afternoon at Canberra Stadium. The futures of other mass gatherings such as Anzac Day, especially the increasingly popular dawn ceremony, are still to be decided, but at this stage remain unchanged. ACT Chief Public Health Officer Dr Kerryn Coleman told a press conference this week that cancelling large-scale events, such as Anzac Day or Easter Sunday church services, was not warranted at the moment. &ldquo;From a health perspective, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee are actually considering the role of public gatherings in the potential spread of this disease at the moment and considering what some of the principles are around when it might beneficial and when it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dr Coleman said. &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s not off the cards, but it&rsquo;s not being considered right at this point in time. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t community transmission at the moment so it wouldn&rsquo;t be effective right at this point in time. &ldquo;I think as the situation evolves and we will see more transmission, that&rsquo;s when the consideration of those kind of events will betaking place.&rdquo; The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee is the key decision-making committee for health emergencies and comprises all state and territory chief health officers. &ldquo;At this time the AHPPC consider that public events should proceed, but strongly recommend that people that are unwell with cough or fever or other respiratory symptoms should not attend public events or gatherings. This is particularly so for people who have recently travelled from overseas,&rdquo; it said. A statement from the ACT government said it was not considering cancelling any planned public events. &ldquo;With no confirmed cases in the ACT at present, people should go about their daily lives as per usual and get out and about and enjoy what Canberra has to offer,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;While cancelling public events is an option, should it be required, these decisions will be made on the advice of the medical experts, as is the case with any public health response to a communicable disease outbreak. &ldquo;Stop the spread of germs in our community - practise good hand hygiene and cover your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing to help. And if you&rsquo;re unwell, you should stay at home from work or school and avoid social activities and large public events.&rdquo; Skyfire, meanwhile, is staged by radio station 104.7. Canberra FM Radio general manager Craig Wagstaff said the station was being guided by advice from health authorities on Skyfire. &ldquo;As part of our primary focus for a safe event, we are certainly conscious of and monitoring official advice and reports,&rdquo; Mr Wagstaff said. &ldquo;We will continue to monitor advice provided by the ACT Health Directorate and the federal government Department of Health who have yet to suggest or place restrictions or even forward plans for such advice, on events with large crowds, such as HIT104.7 Skyfire or other large scale/crowd events planned for Canberra across this coming weekend.&rdquo; Canberra Airport general manager Stephen Byron confirmed to The Canberra Times on Wednesday that it was reviewing the airport&rsquo;s popular open day, which is expected to attract 30,000 people on Sunday, April 5. &ldquo;A decision on the open day will be made on Monday or Tuesday following consultations with key stakeholders this week,&rdquo; Mr Byron said. READ MORE: But the National Folk Festival will still take place at Exhibition Park in Canberra over Easter, from Thursday, April 9 to Monday, April 13. &ldquo;Currently, there is only a small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia and zero confirmed cases in the ACT,&rdquo; a statement from the Folk Festival organisers read. &ldquo;The festival is working closely with ACT Health and other government agencies to monitor the situation and ensure that the event responds to all recommended actions and guidelines. &ldquo;The festival is pleased to advise that official authorities have reported that attending public events is a low-risk activity as per the statement released by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. This includes the National Folk Festival.&rdquo; Some extra measures will be taken &ldquo;The festival will be implementing additional safety measures for attendees, artists and volunteers, including clear signage throughout the festival site, hand washing and sanitation in festival toilets, and additional hand sanitation stations throughout the festival&rdquo;. Festival managing director Helen Roben urged people to stay calm and stay informed. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Folkie&rsquo; remains a great option for individuals and families looking to enjoy a day out during Easter. More than ever, the National Folk Festival is an event that promotes community and creativity,&rdquo; she said.</p>
