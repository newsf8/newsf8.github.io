<p>These last three months have been very trying for the country as a whole. Here at the Daily Mining Gazette, we have suffered alongside you the reader. Obviously, not in the same way, but it has led to some issues which we hope to have under control soon.</p>
<p>One the biggest, and most consistent complaints we have been getting in the past few weeks has revolved around the crossword puzzle situation. We apologize for all of the confusion created by the issue to this point.</p>
<p>With the coronavirus pandemic hitting at the end of February, we shut our doors to customers while other businesses were also forced to close their doors and send their employees home. With businesses not opening, that meant their advertizing revenue lagged significantly.</p>
<p>With that lag, we have been forced to cut back on the number of pages we print on a daily basis. The ensuing confusion over what pages are “essential” led to a weekend edition in early May to print without a large weekend crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>You spoke out. We listened.</p>
<p>We have moved the weekend crossword puzzle to the Green Sheet. Of course, this also came at a price, as we removed the word search in the Green Sheet to make room for the crossword.</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart that we feel it is necessary to mention that another section will be hitting the chopping block next week. As of next week, Happenings will not be appearing in in the Thursday paper.</p>
<p>If you have been reading the section, we had to cut it back, first from 20 pages to 16 pages, then recently again to 12, so this should not shock anyone. We are working on finding a new home for the TV Guide grids within the paper as it stands now. We promise they won’t disappear entirely, but you will have to keep an eye out for them every day as we search for the best home for them.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has created a lot of havoc in many different ways. However, we have fought to keep it from stopping our efforts provide as timely and in-depth news as we can each and every day.</p>
<p>We at the Daily Mining Gazette are proud of our local community and will continue to work hard to improve our product so that you as the reader get the information you need to stay informed, both about the Copper Country and larger world that surrounds it.

<h3 id="la-county-releases-first-neighborhood-breakdown-of-covid-19-deaths-poor-areas-hit-hard">&ldquo;L.A. County releases first neighborhood breakdown of COVID-19 deaths; poor areas hit hard&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4885a3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5637x2959+0+399/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F8b%2F97ee12314298a6f254ebe6d49b6e%2Fla-photos-1staff-515540-me-0406-neighborhood-mwy-1610.JPG" alt="img">
The first neighborhood-level glimpse of the COVID-19 death toll in Los Angeles County shows in grim detail that poorer areas are seeing an outsize number of fatalities.</p>
<p>Some of the highest death rates are in low-income neighborhoods of Central Los Angeles, a Times analysis of county health department data released Tuesday shows.</p>
<p>Working-class neighborhoods such as East Hollywood, Pico-Union and Westlake all have more than 40 deaths per 100,000 people, which is four times higher than the countywide rate of 9.9 per 100,000. Many neighborhoods across South L.A. also had higher death rates, figures show.</p>
<p>County health officials said this week that those who live in lower-income communities in L.A. County are more likely to die of the disease than those in wealthier communities.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“This data is deeply disturbing, and it speaks to the need for immediate action in communities with disproportionately high rates of death,” Barbara Ferrer, the county’s public health director, said earlier this week. “This would mean increased testing, better access and connection to healthcare and support services, and more accurate, culturally appropriate information about COVID-19.”</p>
<p>One complicating factor is that some of the communities with the highest death rates in the county are home to long-term care facilities, including skilled nursing homes and assisted living facilities that have been hot spots for coronavirus outbreaks. That includes the Little Armenia neighborhood of Los Angeles, which topped the countywide list with 20 deaths and a death rate of 249 per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>There have been 19 deaths in the city of Bell with a rate of 52 per 100,000 people. That places the southeast L.A. County city among the top 10 highest of more than 300 communities countywide, according to the health department data.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>All of those fatalities appear to be associated with the Bell Convalescent Hospital, a facility that is linked to 19 coronavirus deaths, county records show.</p>
<p>Some of the areas with the highest death rates also lead the nation in levels of overcrowding, including Pico-Union and Westlake where more than a third of housing units are crowded — meaning there is more than one person per room, excluding bathrooms. A recent Times report found that Los Angeles County has five of the 10 most crowded ZIP Codes in the United States, and public health officials said such housing conditions can accelerate the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Officials have also found that African Americans are dying at the highest rate in the county. The death rate for African Americans is 13.2 per 100,000 people, compared with 9.8 for Latinos, 7.9 for Asians and 5.7 for whites, according to county figures released earlier this week.</p>
<p>“This is significantly higher than the mortality rate of all other races and ethnicities,” Ferrer said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Those rates were calculated based on the 865 people who died whose race or ethnicity has been identified as of Monday.</p>
<p>The new community-level data were released as part of an interactive COVID-19 dashboard the county launched Tuesday that provides more detailed information on testing, cases and deaths than was previously available. It includes graphs that show cumulative and daily figures for confirmed cases and deaths, along with information broken down by community, poverty level, age, gender and race.</p>
<p>After appearing to level off for a time, the number of COVID-19 cases reported in Los Angeles County rose at a rapid clip over the last week.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Some of that is because of increased testing, as well as the clearing of a backlog of pending test results, officials said.</p>
<p>L.A. County has one-quarter of California’s population, but has been home to about half of the deaths so far. On Tuesday, an additional 59 coronavirus deaths were reported in the county, pushing the total past 1,000.</p>
<p>The county health department said that 46% of all deaths were among residents in institutional settings, most of them residents of skilled nursing facilities. The California National Guard is now assisting with staffing at some nursing homes.</p>
<p>It’s taken weeks for the disproportionate effect on poor people of color to become apparent as health officials slowly roll out more complete demographic information.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Earlier in the outbreak, for instance, some of L.A. County’s whitest and wealthiest enclaves were reporting higher rates of infection than poorer neighborhoods of color, according to a Times analysis. But county officials and health experts said that was an incomplete picture of the true spread of the virus, and skewed by uneven access to testing and international travel by wealthy residents.</p>
<p>But that trend has shifted in recent weeks. Lower-income neighborhoods, including the Vermont Square neighborhood of South L.A. and Pico-Union now rank among the top communities countywide in the number of reported cases per capita.

<h3 id="california-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-1000-and-la-is-hardest-hit">&ldquo;California coronavirus death toll tops 1,000, and L.A. is hardest hit&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/743099d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4492x2358+0+318/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2F6a%2F9ffeaa4a476ca821e7ec5e539e36%2Fla-photos-1staff-525829-me-nurses-action-jja-07.JPG" alt="img">
As California continues its fight against the coronavirus, the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the state surpassed 1,000 on Friday — nearly half of them in Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>Although officials noted there has been progress in flattening the curve of new coronavirus cases, L.A. County’s death rate continues to climb. An additional 40 deaths were reported Friday, for a total of 501, and deaths are continuing to double every week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Friday.</p>
<p>Additionally, 1,624 people are hospitalized, with 33% of patients in intensive care units, said Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County’s public health director.</p>
<p>Ferrer cited two possible reasons for the continued uptick: a lag between when new cases are reported and when people who become sick with COVID-19 die of the illness; and an increase in outbreaks in institutional settings.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Of those who have died, 177 were residents of such facilities, primarily skilled nursing and assisted living homes, Ferrer said. They represent about 36% of all deaths in L.A. County, she said.</p>
<p>In total, 2,183 people who live or work in institutional settings have been infected, including 1,215 residents and 968 staff members, Ferrer said.</p>
<p>“We have many more skilled nursing facilities that have seen a significant number of cases within those facilities,” she said. “And the people who are residents in those facilities are often already in fragile medical condition, and a disease like COVID-19 both spreads more easily in a congregate living situation and also can have devastating impacts on people with underlying health conditions.”</p>
<p>As of Friday, the L.A. County Department of Public Health was investigating 228 institutions that had reported at least one confirmed case of the coronavirus, an increase of 19 from the day before. They include 20 care facilities that had more than 20 residents test positive and four that had 40 or more residents test positive, Ferrer said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In addition, there have been 77 confirmed cases in county jail facilities, including 17 inmates and 60 staff members, and 67 cases in federal and state prisons, including 56 inmates and 11 staff members, she said.</p>
<p>“We are extraordinarily worried about the outbreaks that continue to happen across the many different institutional settings,” she said.</p>
<p>She said the county has asked the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state for help implementing strict infection control procedures at some of the group living sites and is also seeking staffing support to make up for a high level of absences at some facilities.</p>
<p>The rising death toll comes even as the growth of coronavirus cases appears to be slowing in the state. Officials have cautiously credited stay-at-home orders for the deceleration but say the trend could reverse if the restrictions are lifted too soon.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Garcetti said the city is preparing for a surge of COVID-19 cases and has opened a medical relief center at the Los Angeles Convention Center with a capacity of 175 beds for patients who don’t have the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“So far because you’ve done a great job flattening the curve our hospitals have been able to manage the patient volume,” Garcetti said. “But as I’ve said, our numbers continue to go up even if they go up more slowly, and people are going into hospitals more quickly than they are going out.”</p>
<p>As of Friday, a total of 1,551 hospital beds and 232 ventilators were available in Los Angeles, he said.</p>
<p>Los Angeles will continue to ramp up testing efforts, and Garcetti encouraged residents to seek testing if they believe they have been exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Even if you’re asymptomatic, we need you to get tested,” he said. “We need to know because if you don’t know, you might not be isolated from people you know. That kills people.”</p>
<p>The county has added 11 new testing centers in the last week and has the ability to process about 12,000 tests a day, he said.</p>
<p>Garcetti said the city and county were also continuing efforts to house at-risk homeless individuals in shelters, hotels and, soon, trailers provided by the state.</p>
<p>Homeless residents who are older than 65 or who have chronic medical conditions will be housed in the trailers in a Woodland Hills recreation center, and the city plans to acquire more than 300 additional trailers in the coming weeks, Garcetti said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Orange County reported three additional COVID-19 deaths Friday and 77 new cases, for a total of 1,501 cases and 28 deaths. In San Francisco, 1,058 have tested positive for the virus, and 20 have died.</p>
<p>In the Central Valley, one worker at a Safeway distribution center has died of complications from the coronavirus, and 51 others have been infected, officials said this week.</p>
<p>Andrew Whelan, a spokesman for Safeway owner Albertsons Cos., said 3% of the roughly 1,700 workers at the Tracy facility in San Joaquin County had tested positive for the virus, and additional health and safety measures are now in place.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The center provides groceries to about 300 stores throughout Northern California, Nevada and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Though California’s coronavirus crisis began in the Bay Area, Los Angeles County now accounts for an outsize number of deaths.</p>
<p>The county represents a quarter of California’s population but has been the site of almost half of COVID-19 deaths, a Times data analysis found. Thursday marked the third straight day the county saw a record number of COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The five-county Southern California region accounts for roughly 60% of deaths in California linked to the disease, though the region comprises just 48% of California’s population.</p>
<p>Those numbers led to California recording its worst one-day death total Wednesday, with 101 new fatalities.</p>
<p>Despite the continued rise in deaths, daily tallies of new cases in California suggest the spread of the virus is slowing. So does the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units, which has remained between 1,100 and 1,200 since April 7.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that 1,191 Californians were in intensive care as of Wednesday — a 1.4% day-to-day increase — but that the overall number of patients hospitalized ticked down by almost 1%, to 3,141.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“That’s good news, but again, I caution everybody: One day’s data does not make a trend,” he said.</p>
<p>L.A. County officials have said that although stay-at-home orders have slowed the spread of the coronavirus, they remain worried about the possibility of more outbreaks. They forecast last week that up to 30% of the county’s 10 million residents could be infected by midsummer without more behavioral changes, such as reducing shopping trips.</p>
<p>Even as officials stressed that the progress could be reversed if stay-at-home orders were lifted too soon, protesters across the country gathered to rally against the orders Friday. In Huntington Beach, more than 100 people, many standing close together without protective gear, called for an end to the lockdown.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several Bay Area counties issued additional orders requiring residents and workers to wear face coverings when traveling to essential businesses or riding public transportation.</p>
<p>Dr. Grant Colfax, San Francisco’s director of public health, said the orders won’t replace the six-foot physical distancing requirement. The order will be enforced by police.</p>
<p>Times staff writer Maura Dolan contributed to this report.

<h3 id="black-people-are-disproportionately-hit-hard-by-coronavirus-la-county-is-taking-action">&ldquo;Black people are disproportionately hit hard by coronavirus. L.A. County is taking action&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fdf1b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5123x2690+0+342/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc2%2Fea%2Fa721683147c3b0088f98ad800a09%2Fla-photos-1staff-514571-me-neighborhood-community-jja-0016.JPG" alt="img">
Los Angeles County’s health services department will partner with a local private nonprofit university to expand testing access to South L.A. residents and analyze demographic data to better determine how diverse communities are being affected by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>A coronavirus mobile testing site will open Wednesday at the Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science to serve residents in Willowbrook, South Los Angeles and surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>For the record: A previous version of this story said the county public health department is involved in the expansion of testing. It is the county’s health services department.</p>
<p>The university will also begin working with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to collect and analyze demographic data, including information on ethnicity and ZIP code in relation to the number of tests performed, test results, hospitalization and fatality rates.</p>
<p>“It is heartening to know that residents of South L.A. and the surrounding areas will now have a convenient place to get tested,” Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas said in a statement. “It is imperative, now more than ever, to ensure that we are continuing our work against longstanding health disparities by ensuring greater equity and access to resources in our communities.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Ridley-Thomas said the demographic data will help better ensure resources are equitably distributed to the communities that need them most.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Los Angeles County health officials released preliminary data that showed black residents were dying at a slightly higher rate than other races.</p>
<p>The data, which L.A. County public health director Barbara Ferrer cautioned were based on just 57% of reported deaths so far, provide the first official snapshot of the coronavirus illness’ impact on race in the state of California. The release follows recent findings that black people are falling to the illness at higher rates than other races in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the county said that 169 people had died of COVID-19. Of those deaths, officials had racial information for 93 and released the following breakdown:</p>

<p>Latino 28%</p>
<p>White 27%</p>
<p>Asian 19%</p>
<p>Black 17%</p>
<p>Other 9%</p>
<p>“When we look at these numbers by the total population of each group, African Americans have a slightly higher rate of death than other races,” Ferrer said.</p>
<p>Black people make up 9% of the population of L.A. County.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Latinos comprise nearly half the county population but 28% of deaths.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The coronavirus death percentages for white and Asian residents more closely matched their share of the county population.</p>
<p>Nationwide, states have started releasing data that show stark disparities between black and white victims of the coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>Local leaders hope the new testing site and data analysis will help better ensure everyone gets the help they need during the outbreak.</p>
<p>“The higher death rates from COVID-19 in Black communities is sadly, not surprising,” Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith, the university’s College of Medicine dean, said in a statement. “There is an old saying in the Black community that when America gets a cold, the Black community gets pneumonia. The disparities that exists in healthcare are not explained by any one factor; multiple things add up to increase risk and create more severe outcomes. Poverty, institutional racism, poor public schools, lack of health insurance and lack of access to healthcare are some of those factors. With COVID-19, the higher rates of chronic diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney failure among African-Americans help explain the higher rates of death from the disease among Black Americans.”</p>

<p>Recently, a Los Angeles Times analysis found that many of L.A. County’s whitest and wealthiest enclaves were reporting far higher rates of infection than poorer neighborhoods of color. However, public health officials said those disparities did not necessarily mean the virus was spreading more widely through richer neighborhoods than in poorer ones. Instead, the reporting was likely skewed by uneven access to testing and, in some instances, by wealthy residents who traveled internationally and had some of the earliest confirmed infections.

Then there are a couple of equipment references. I don’t know my cleeks from my baffies, so I figured out 88A, “problems with an angled club,” on crosses. Same goes for 100A — my golf knowledge is increasing in leaps and bounds now, but I’d have still been better off with a reference to anemia, say, for this entry (maybe this occurred to me only after actually encountering ANEMIA a few clues later). And, finally, a reminder that I’m still pretty ill-equipped to comment on said sport, even though I thought this theme and its clues were lovely.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>I love all the little bubbles of youth that effervesce through this grid, ranging from goofy (GAG, SNARF and ARFED, PLONKS) to snarky (TOUPEE) to techy (how can “In Real Life” be a debut?). I loved the clue for APP as well, referring to something you buy on your phone (and I fell down the rabbit hole on this one, because there are a lot of good apps that they’re pushing on us for free now that we’re an even more captive audience).</p>
<p>4A: I love bees, too, and I hope it warms up soon in Queens so I can enjoy them buzzing through the crab apples near my house. I have a neighbor who keeps a hive in his yard and dons a suit, so I guess I have a local APIARY.</p>
<p>71A: We can count this as sporting equipment, a BOBSTAY, for sailers and yachters — right? I’d never have guessed it without SPEEDBAG crossing, which also helped with AEGIS, with a tough clue.</p>
<p>31D: Sigh, Harry Potter, I get it — he’s here, he’s everyweir, I need to get used to it. This is the second time ELDER WAND has been in the Times grid and the second time ELDER WAND has been in a Jeff Chen Times grid. Repetitus Chenitus!</p>
<p>50D: I enjoyed a SETI reference in the same grid as BAT SIGNAL.</p>
<p>102D: A sentimental favorite today; we tend to think of “spoilers” as ruining the ending, but NANAS provide a much more comforting experience. Juxtaposed next to CRONE? Bad FENG SHUI.</p>
<p>Constructor Notes</p>
<p>Mr. Mowat: Before I say anything at all, I want to take this chance to wish my sister Margaret a happy 16th birthday!!! With that out of the way, I am very happy to have my first Sunday puzzle published in the NYT! (Of course this is far from Jeff’s first.) Being that this was my first stab at a 21x grid it was tricky getting the fill for this one. With the long themer spanning the middle, we had to make a few compromises, especially in the upper half of the grid, but I am still happy with how it turned out. We got some nice stuff in there and I’m particularly proud to debut the three-letter entry IRL. The theme started off pretty broad but Jeff and I were able to narrow it down to some fun golf themers. At that point we discovered that a similarly themed Sunday puzzle ran in the times in 2012. We felt as though this was long enough ago to press on but we thought that it needed an extra element. It was Jeff’s idea then to focus on mistakes a golfer might make. This addition made the theme a lot tighter and made me smile at each theme entry a little bit more. Finally, a big shout out to my dad, an avid golfer, whom I had in the back of my mind as this puzzle got made. I know this doesn’t make up for the Masters getting postponed, but maybe this is the next best thing! Hope everyone is happy and healthy, and enjoys the puzzle!</p>

<h3 id="world-virus-deaths-exceed-100000-new-york-region-hit-hard">&ldquo;World virus deaths exceed 100,000; New York region hit hard&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/APTOPIX_Virus_Outbreak_Spain_41281.jpg" alt="img">
NEW YORK — The worldwide death toll from the coronavirus surged past 100,000 Friday as the epidemic in the U.S. cut a widening swath through not just New York City but the entire three-state metropolitan area of 20 million people connected by a tangle of subways, trains and buses.</p>
<p>In the bedroom communities across the Hudson River in New Jersey, to the east on Long Island and north to Connecticut, officials were recording some of the worst outbreaks in the country, even as public health authorities expressed optimism that the pace of infections appeared to be slowing.</p>
<p>As of Friday, the New York metropolitan area accounted for more than half the nation’s 18,500-plus deaths, with other hot spots in places such as Detroit, Louisiana and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>“Once it gets into the city, there are so many commuters and travel, it gets everywhere,” said Matt Mazewski, a Columbia University economics student who tried to get away from the epicenter by leaving his apartment near the New York City campus for his parents’ house in Long Valley, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Confirmed infections reached about 1.7 million worldwide, while they surpassed half a million in the U.S., according to a Johns Hopkins University count.</p>
<p>The U.S. is on track to overtake Italy as the country with the highest number of dead, though the true figures on infections and lives lost around the world are believed be much higher because of limited testing, government cover-ups and different counting practices.</p>
<p>In places such as New York, Italy and Spain, for example, many victims who died outside a hospital — say, in a house or a nursing home — have not been included in the count.</p>
<p>With Christians around the world heading into Easter weekend, public health officials and religious leaders alike urged people to stay home, warning that violating lockdowns and social distancing rules could cause the virus to come storming back. Authorities in Europe put up roadblocks, used helicopters and drones, and cited drivers who had no good reason to be out.</p>
<p>Even in places where the crisis seemed to be easing, the daily death totals were hard to bear.</p>
<p>“I understand intellectually why it’s happening,” said Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, where deaths rose by 777, to more than 7,800. “It doesn’t make it any easier to accept.”</p>
<p>But New York officials also said the number of people in intensive care dropped for the first time since mid-March and hospitalizations were slowing: 290 new patients in a single day, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week. Cuomo said that if the trend holds, New York might not need the overflow field hospitals that officials have been scrambling to build.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s outbreaks began with the state’s first confirmed infection, in a man who commuted between New York and his Fort Lee apartment. The virus is now in all 21 New Jersey counties.</p>
<p>Some suburbs had an infection rate even higher than New York City’s, including Rockland County, where the rate was double.</p>
<p>As of Friday, Nassau County, on New York’s Long Island, had over 700 deaths. Bergen County, New Jersey, and Westchester County, New York, had around 400 each. Essex County, New Jersey, and Suffolk County, New York, both recorded more than 350. Fairfield County, Connecticut, had about 180.</p>
<p>Officials said many of Connecticut’s infections can be traced to cases in New York’s Westchester County.</p>
<p>“This is a virus that knows no borders,” Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said last month.</p>
<p>For several days, two of the globe’s other worst-hit places, Italy and Spain, reported that new infections, hospitalizations and deaths have been leveling off even as the daily death tolls remain shocking.</p>
<p>Spain recorded 605 more deaths, its lowest figure in more than two weeks, bringing its overall toll to more than 15,800. Italy reported 570 additional deaths for a total of more than 18,800.</p>
<p>With some signs of hope emerging, questions intensified about when restrictions might be loosened. Spain said factories and construction sites could resume work Monday, while schools, most shops and offices will remain closed. In Italy, there were pleas to restart manufacturing.</p>
<p>Though President Trump insisted he would not lift restrictions until it’s safe, he announced an “Opening our Country” task force and said, “I want to get it open as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that easing restrictions prematurely could “lead to a deadly resurgence.”</p>
<p>Italy, Ireland and Greece were among the countries extending lockdown orders into May.</p>
<p>As the threat receded in some places, it increased elsewhere. In the U.S., Michigan announced 205 new deaths Friday, its highest daily total, up from 117 a day earlier. In Europe, Britain recorded 980 new deaths, likewise a one-day high, for close to 9,000 dead in all.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remained hospitalized with the virus but was out of intensive care. His father, Stanley Johnson, said the prime minister needs to “rest up” before returning to work.</p>
<p>On Good Friday, some churches worldwide held services online, while others arranged prayers at drive-in theaters.</p>
<p>In Paris, services were broadcast from a nearly empty, closed-to-the-public Notre Dame Cathedral, still heavily scarred from a fire a year ago. In Warsaw, Poland, priests wearing masks heard confessions in a parking lot. And in New Orleans, the Catholic archbishop sprinkled holy water from the Jordan River from a biplane traveling overhead.</p>

<h3 id="survey-shows-san-diego-nonprofits-hit-hard-by-coronavirus-outbreak">&ldquo;Survey shows San Diego nonprofits hit hard by coronavirus outbreak&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91fdbc1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1384x727+0+26/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F89%2F0560af13c2e04abb1a4ca7695399%2Fsd-1544810514-u8akhnnu2b-snap-image" alt="img">
A new survey released Tuesday shows hundreds of San Diego nonprofits face critical operations and payroll challenges as the coronavirus outbreak worsens and the economic shutdown continues.</p>
<p>More than 420 organizations responded to a questionnaire issued by The Nonprofit Institute at the University of San Diego, which provides nonprofits and other organizations with education, training and research.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of the responding nonprofits reported a reduction in normal services or programs related to school closures, stay-at-home orders and social distancing.</p>
<p>About 20 percent said they are unable to offer any programs at this time.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Even if conditions were to improve, more than half said it is “very unlikely” or “somewhat unlikely” they would be able to provide ongoing services eight weeks from now.</p>
<p>In the survey about 14 percent of nonprofit leaders said they are “very unlikely” to make payroll in the next four weeks. Close to a quarter said they won’t be able to make payroll in eight weeks.</p>
<p>Emily Young, Nonprofit Institute’s executive director, said nonprofits are San Diego’s “safety net,” and the unfolding public health and economic crisis is preventing many of them from providing helpful services to the community.</p>
<p>“They need immediate economic assistance from government, philanthropy and the community at large,” Young said in the statement. “We encourage everyone to do their part in donating to the organizations they hold dear.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Survey results show nonprofit leaders rated a decline in donations as the most urgent challenge at this time.</p>
<p>The second challenge was a loss of fees for service revenue, followed by employee layoffs, delays in grant processing and government grant contracts that can’t be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Previous research from The Nonprofit Institute shows the majority of nonprofits operate on very lean reserves of two months or less.</p>
<p>In this latest study, even fiscally strong nonprofits reported they have lost revenue streams from canceled programs and events.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>GRID Alternatives San Diego, a nonprofit that installs solar panels for low-income families at no cost, had to drastically cut its installation services because of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>“We keep the doors open by installing solar and when this hit, we had to stop,” said Paul Cleary, GRID Alternative’s executive director. “That’s a huge blow. We don’t have a huge amount of cash in reserves, so we can’t wait it out for that long.”</p>
<p>GRID Alternatives also provides job training for workers interested in entering the solar industry. To prevent the spread of coronavirus and keep staffers safe, Cleary said the program was completely shut down, and without trainees and volunteers, the organization’s solar installation program is operating at a reduced capacity.</p>
<p>“We want to be there at the end of this. People are still calling and need our services,” he said. “So really nothing is off the table when it comes to cuts we’ll have to make to survive this. Layoffs are certainly on that table.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>GRID Alternatives San Diego is accepting donations on their website.</p>
<p>Operation Hope-North County in Vista recently announced it will close its year-round shelter for homeless families and single women in about two weeks. It launched a last-minute fundraiser in hopes of staying open.</p>
<p>According to the survey, essential service nonprofits such as those providing food, shelter and health care remain open to serve the community but are struggling to secure supplies to maintain the health and safety of staff members, volunteers and clients.</p>
<p>Those supplies include cleaning supplies, personal protective equipment such as gloves and face masks, and paper goods, especially toilet paper and paper towels.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>At Escondido-based Interfaith Community Services, Executive Director Greg Anglea said donations of toilet paper and non-perishable food are needed for home-bound low-income seniors, and hand-sanitizers and disinfectant wipes are needed for its shelter. Jackets also are needed for people without housing.</p>
<p>Donations can be dropped off at 550 W. Washington Ave. in Escondido, between 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.</p>
<p>The East County Homeless Task Force also put out a call for donations at nonprofits in its area. And Crisis House, an emergency resource center, is asking for toilet paper, hand sanitizer in large dispensers, individually packaged sanitizer wipes, baby wipes and hygiene kits. Donations can be dropped off 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 1034 N. Magnolia Ave. in El Cajon.
