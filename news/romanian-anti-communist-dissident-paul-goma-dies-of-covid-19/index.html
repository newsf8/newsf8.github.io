<p>Romanian writer and anti-Communist dissident Paul Goma has died in Paris aged 84 after being diagnosed with coronavirus, his biographer Mariana Sipos told the Romanian news portal G4Media on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“After receiving a message from France, I announce with sorrow and great pain the departure from among us of the great writer and dissident Paul Goma,” the statement read.</p>
<p>According to Sipos, Goma died during the night between March 24 and 25. “He had been admitted to the La Pitie Salpetriere hospital since 18 March, after he was diagnosed with the killer virus,” the note said.</p>
<p>Goma will be buried in Paris, where he had lived since being deported by Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1977.</p>
<p>A refugee from the former Romanian province of Bessarabia, today’s Moldova, Goma first got into conflict with Romania’s Communist secret police as a highschool student in the early 1950s, after he publicly praised anti-government partisans fighting the regime in the mountains.</p>
<p>Goma continued criticising the authorities, both in his writings and through other symbolic forms.</p>
<p>His defiant attitude to the one-party dictatorship landed him in prison in the late-1950s. He spent two years behind bars and was subsequently banished to different locations outside Bucharest.</p>
<p>He supported the anti-Soviet revolt in Hungary in 1956 and the Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia in 1977, when he was stripped of the Romanian nationality and forced to leave the country after challenging Ceausescu in several letters in which he addressed the dictator in personal terms.</p>
<p>From exile in France, where he was granted asylum, he continued to denounce the abuses of the dictatorship in his country.</p>
<p>Known for his volcanic temperament, he had virulent disagreements with other figures in the Romanian exiled community.</p>
<p>After 2005, he published various articles of antisemitic nature that were internationally condemned by Jewish and human rights organizations.</p>
<p>Some of his books translated into English are My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest (1990). He is also known for his volumes of journals.

Romanian anticommunist dissident Paul Goma dies of Covid-19</p>
<p>Romanian writer Paul Goma, known as a leading opponent of the communist regime in the country, passed away in Paris after contracting the Covid-19 infection.</p>
<p>Goma, who was 84 years old, died during the night of March 24 to March 25. He had been admitted at the La Pitié Salpêtrière hospital in Paris since March 18.</p>
<p>Goma was born in 1935, in the village of Mana, in Basarabia. In 1949 he was admitted at the Gheorghe Lazăr High School in Sibiu. In 1952, he was banned from enrolling in any school in the country after the secret police Securitate detained him for eight days for having talked about the anticommunist resistance in the country at school and for keeping “a codified intimate diary.” After several attempts, he managed to enroll at the Negru Vodă High School in Făgăraș.</p>
<p>In 1954, he started his studies at the Mihai Eminescu Literature and Literary Criticism Institute, which became, in 1955, a department of the Philology Faculty of the University of Bucharest.</p>
<p>On November 22, 1956, he was arrested on attempting to organize a manifestation of support for the Hungarian Revolution. He was detained and in 1957 he was sentenced to two years in prison for disturbing public order. In March 1958 he was sent to serve his sentence at the Gherla penitentiary, from where he was released in November but placed under house arrest for 36 months in the village of Lătești, in the regional department of Fetești. In November 1961, the interdiction to leave the house was extended for another 24 months. He was released in January 1963.</p>
<p>In 1971, his novel Ostinato, which the Romanian censors had banned, was published at the Suhrkamp publishing house in Germany and at the Gallimard publishing house in France. In 1976, his novel Gherla was published in France, also at Gallimard. The novel was later broadcast as a series by radio Free Europe, narrated by the author, who was in Romania at the time.</p>
<p>In January 1977, radio Free Europe broadcast a letter Goma addressed to a group of writers in Czechoslovakia, expressing his solidarity with their situation and denouncing the human rights violation. In February of the same year, Goma wrote an open letter to dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, protesting the human rights breaches in the country. As his initiative started gathering support, he was arrested in April. He was released from prison in May, following an international campaign and the protest of PEN Club International, led at the time by Mario Vargas Llosa.</p>
<p>In November 1977, Goma, together with his wife and son, left Romania for Paris, where they requested political asylum. Goma went on to work and publish in the French capital and lived there until his death.</p>

Scriitorul şi dizidentul anticomunist Paul Goma a murit din cauza COVID-19. Era internat în Franţa</p>
<p>Paul Goma a încetat din viaţă, anunţă biografa acestuia, Mariana Sipoş.</p>
<p>„În urma unui mesaj primit din Franţa, cu regret si mare durere anunţ plecarea dintre noi a marelui scriitor şi disident Paul Goma, în noaptea din 24 spre 25 martie 2020. Paul Goma era internat din 18 martie la spitalul La Pitié Salpêtrière, în urma constatării infectării cu virusul ucigaş. Conform informaţiilor transmise de echipa medicală care l-a îngrijit, Paul Goma a plecat senin, fără durere şi cu sufletul împăcat“, arată Mariana Sipoş într-un text trimis MEDIAFAX.</p>
<p>„Conform indicaţiilor lui Filip Goma, respectând dorinţa tatălui său şi ţinând cont de restricţiile actuale în vigoare în Franţa, trupul lui Paul Goma va fi incinerat, iar urna funerară va fi depusă în Columbarium, la cimitirului Pére Lachaise din Paris“, arată Mariana Sipoş.</p>
<p>Paul Goma s-a născut la Mana, Orhei, în 1935. După cedarea Basarabiei fostei U.R.S.S., familia sa s-a refugiat în România. În 1977 a trimis o scrisoare de solidarizare cu Charta 77 din Cehoslovacia şi o scrisoare deschisă lui Nicolae Ceauşescu. A fost anchetat de Securitate şi arestat dar a fost eliberat la insistenţele Amnesty International. În noiembrie 1977, Paul Goma, soţia şi fiul său se trezeau că li s-a retras cetăţenia română. Au cerut azil politic la Paris. A debutat ca scriitor cu volumul Camera de alături, în 1968. Romanul Ostinato, din 1971, a fost cenzurat de autorităţile comuniste şi din acel moment, Goma s-a confruntat cu interdicţii de semnătură, anchete şi arest la domiciliu. Romanele sale rămân inconfundabile în literatura română, Goma continuând să scrie în română şi după ce s-a stabilit la Paris. România nu a reuşit să rezolve situaţia lui Paul Goma nici după trei decenii de la căderea comunismului.
