Prime Minister Scott Morrison has recommended Australian war hero Edward &ldquo;Teddy&rdquo; Sheean be given a posthumous Victoria Cross, after an expert panel found there was &ldquo;maladministration&rdquo; in the original decisions not to award him the nation&rsquo;s highest military honour.</p>
<p>The federal government earlier this year rejected the findings of the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal report, which unanimously recommended Ordinary Seaman Sheean receive the VC for his 1942 heroics when the HMAS Armidale was sunk by Japanese bombers in the Timor Sea.</p>

<p>At the time, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the tribunal &ldquo;did not present any new evidence that might support reconsideration of the valour inquiries recommendation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old strapped himself to an anti-aircraft gun as the vessel went down and is credited with saving the lives of 49 crew during the height of World War II. He shot down at least one aircraft, before dying at his gun.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has recommended the Queen posthumously award World War II hero Edward &lsquo;Teddy&rsquo; Sheean a Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>Key points: An expert panel recommended Teddy Sheean receive a Victoria Cross for World War II valour</p>

<p>Tasmanian Sheean, an 18-year-old with less than two years at sea, was an Ordinary Seaman on the minesweeper HMAS Armidale when it came under heavy attack from Japanese aircraft off the coast of what is now Timor-Leste in 1942.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison ordered an expert panel re-examine the case for Sheean receiving Australia&rsquo;s highest military honour after earlier attempts had failed to recommend he receive a Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>Sheean is recorded as helping launch life rafts before returning to his anti-aircraft gun to fire at enemy aircraft that were strafing his shipmates as they floundered in the water, despite the order having been given to abandon ship.</p>
<p>Dale Marsh&rsquo;s painting of Teddy Sheean hangs in the Australian War Memorial. ( Australian War Memorial )</p>
<p>Witness accounts from the day have him firing as the ship sank. He was never seen again.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said he had accepted the findings of the expert panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there is compelling new evidence in support of higher recognition for Sheean, that Sheean was done a substantial injustice in consideration of his actions in the original decision-making period in 1942 to 1943,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sheean&rsquo;s courageous sacrifice of his life to save his shipmates makes him eligible for the Victoria Cross for Australia and the highest level of recognition should be accorded in this exceptional case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Former defence minister and Australian War Memorial director Brendan Nelson chaired the expert panel.</p>
<p>The panel also included former solicitor-general David Bennett QC, former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Peter Shergold, and senior curator and historian at the NSW Anzac Memorial, Brad Manera.</p>
<p>Dr Nelson said Teddy Sheean&rsquo;s story was inspiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say to all Australians as we live through the most significant adversity in our lifetimes, approaching the 75th anniversary of the Second World War, let Teddy Sheean inspire us to be a people that are selfless, caring and brave,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Previous attempts at having Sheean awarded a VC have been unsuccessful, with a 2013 inquiry finding Sheean&rsquo;s actions &ldquo;did not reach the particularly high standard required for recommendation of a VC&rdquo;, and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Ministry of Defence refusing to consider him for the accolade in 2017.</p>
<p>In May this year, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said a review held in 2019 by the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal had found &ldquo;no new evidence that might support reconsideration of the valour inquiries recommendation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Soon after that announcement, tribunal chairman Mark Sullivan wrote to Ms Reynolds saying she had misrepresented the findings of the tribunal, demanding she &ldquo;correct the record&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His family have been fighting for the recognition for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Sheean&rsquo;s nephew, Garry Ivory, said in May the review had given the family cause to be &ldquo;very hopeful that this will get us over the line&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At a media conference this afternoon, he said he cried tears of joy when he was told of the PM&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember two dates forever now: the 1st of December 1942 is when Teddy&rsquo;s action was, and now the 10th of August 2020 is going to be a very, very special date in my mind forever,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In a statement, Tasmania&rsquo;s Minister for Veteran Affairs Guy Barnett said today&rsquo;s announcement was &ldquo;worthy recognition of an extraordinary Tasmanian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Barnett, a longtime campaigner for Sheean to receive the award, said he and Sheean&rsquo;s family &ldquo;always believed the evidence was overwhelming and it has been an honour working with Garry and the Sheean family these past 17 years to ensure Teddy&rsquo;s bravery and sacrifice is recognised appropriately&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also particularly acknowledge the only remaining survivor of the Armidale, Ray Leonard, who witnessed Teddy&rsquo;s actions in 1942 and has been an inspiration and great supporter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The motto of the HMAS Armidale was &lsquo;Fight On&rsquo; and all of those involved in this campaign can now rest, satisfied that on behalf of Teddy and his crew mates we did fight on relentlessly, sometimes when the odds seemed against us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teddy&rsquo;s extraordinary bravery and sacrifice to protect his mates should be a time to reflect, and also celebrate, for all Australians — especially at a time when we need inspiration.&rdquo;

Tasmanian war hero Teddy Sheean will be recommended for a Victoria Cross medal.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison made the announcement on Monday in Canberra after last month receiving the findings of a seven-week review.</p>
<p>Sheean was a sailor in WWII that was killed after HMAS Armidale was attacked by Japanese warplanes in the Arafura Sea en route to Timor in 1942. Despite being told to abandon ship, Sheean, 18, was reported to have not left his post and continued to fire his anti-aircraft gun at enemy aircraft. His actions were credited with saving the lives of 49 crew.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison said Sheehan’s case to receive the highest award for servicemen or women had been subject to a series of reviews and panels. Earlier this year the Government decided against recommending Sheean for a VC.</p>
<p>“The challenge that the Government was faced with was that we had two findings of equal standing from two reviews, neither related to each other, that had concluded different results, and so the Government was presented with conflicting evidence,” Mr Morrison said.</p>
<p>“It is a very serious award, and as Prime Minister and as a Government we have a very special responsibility to ensure that the integrity of the Victoria Cross is upheld for all those who have been honoured.”</p>
<p>media_camera Last survivor from the HMAS Armidale, Dr Ray Leonard, called for Teddy Sheean to be awarded a Victoria Cross. Picture: Wayne Taylor</p>
<p>Former War Memorial head Brendan Nelson was on an expert review panel that found new evidence from Japanese aviation military records in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The latest review found that there was “compelling new evidence” to support the recognition of Sheean and that he was “done a substantial injustice” when his actions were initially considered in 1942-43.</p>
<p>Dr Nelson said Sheean was the youngest, lowest ranked seaman on HMAS Armidale who decided to defend against the Japanese instead of getting in a lifeboat.</p>
<p>“This man deserves the Victoria Cross,” Dr Nelson.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison confirmed he would be making the recommendation for the sailor who fought in World War II to be awarded a VC saying the “courageous sacrifice of his life” made him eligible for the top honour.</p>
<p>The latest review followed pressure from the public and Mr Morrison’s own party after the Government did not accept a tribunal recommendation in May to award the war hero the VC.</p>
<p>Tasmanian Veteran Affairs Minister Guy Barnett also appeared before the panel in support of Sheean.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison also paid his respects to all of the families of the 19 Victorians who passed away overnight because of the COVID infection.</p>
