<p>Courtois: brilliant. The saviour. He saved two efforts at the end that saved Madrid. He had little work to do before that and but in the second half, he was called upon and did not disappoint even taking a knee to the head before carrying on and making some important saves - 9.</p>
<p>Carvajal: very sharp on the right. Nearly scored at the start of the game and that was just the start of it as he linked well with Rodrygo and constantly looked to get forward. He was attentive at the back too and shit down Moi Gomez first and Ontiveros after - 8.</p>
<p>Varane: finished what was probably his best league season for Madrid. He is a rock for Real Madrid and he is one of the smartest players on the team. Bringing the ball out, speed to close down attackers and strong in the air too. His speed nullified Chukwueze as a threat - 8.</p>
<p>Ramos: arrived into the title-clinching game in the best form of the year. A leader&rsquo;s display and his speed helped to reduce Villarreal&rsquo;s threat. Provoked the penalty that would eventually win the game and the title for Madrid even if the first effort was suspect - 8.</p>
<p>Mendy: he has completely adapted to the team and is a wall in defense. Every game, he improves in attack although didn&rsquo;t have his best game on the ball. Solid - 7.</p>
<p>Casemiro: his hidden work helps Modric and Kroos to shine. Alway alert and covering when necessary with midfielders and full-backs attacking around him. Adds balance to the side and was precise on the ball. Robbed an important one that gave Madrid the lead after poking it to Modric, who found Benzema - 8.</p>
<p>Kroos: another good game from the Germa although not his best of the season. Rattled the crossbar with a shot - 7.</p>
<p>Modric: an exhibition. Started well and controlled everything throughout. As good in defense as he was in attack. Came back after the break in fine form, his best since winning the Ballon d&rsquo;Or. Delivered the pass for Benzema for the opener and was excellent all night - 9.</p>
<p>Rodrygo: tried his best and showed some flashes. Never stopped trying either but didn&rsquo;t create a lot of danger. Replaced by Asensio just after an hour - 7.</p>
<p>Hazard: he did try but it didn&rsquo;t work out for him again. Fouled a number of times but needs to be adding more. Replaced by Vinicius just after an hour - 6.</p>
<p>Benzema: incredible season from Benzema and finished with a brace. He has now scored 21 goals in LaLiga and is still in with a shout to beat Messi in the race for Pichichi. Top score and leader in attack - 9.</p>
<p>SUBSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>Vinicius: unlucky to have a goal ruled out that he put on a plate for Asensio. He dribbled inside and passed to his teammate but there was a handball in the build up. Unbalanced a number of opponents and looked lively when he came on.</p>
<p>Asensio: came on during a bright spell for Villarreal and didn&rsquo;t really get involved. Scored but it was ruled out. Regaining his spark and putting his injury behind him a game at a time.</p>
<p>Valverde, Isco and Lucas Vázquez: Came on after 84 minutes and struggled to influence play as Real Madrid fought off Villarreal&rsquo;s late surge.

Real Madrid Vs Villarreal - LIVE STREAM</p>
<p>Date- Thursday, July 16 2020 Kick-Off – 22:00 Mecca Channel – 1 HD</p>
<p>Match Report</p>
<p>Karim Benzema scored a goal in each half as Real Madrid clinched a 34th LaLiga title with a 2-1 victory over Villarreal.</p>
<p>The Frenchman&rsquo;s 20th and 21st league goals - the second of which came from a contentious penalty - of the season ultimately earned a win at Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano that meant Barcelona&rsquo;s result against Osasuna was rendered immaterial.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane&rsquo;s men were in control against game opponents until Vicente Iborra&rsquo;s late header made for a nervy finish, but a 10th straight win since LaLiga&rsquo;s resumption means Madrid are champions with a game to spare.</p>
<p>Benzema has scored seven times in that run and it was fitting his contribution should round out their title success given the striker&rsquo;s goals and a solid defensive base have been the pillars of Madrid&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>This game did not initially look like being the banana skin it had the potential to be and it felt a matter of time before Madrid found an opening, albeit bar Luka Modric&rsquo;s long-range drive their early endeavours proved fruitless.</p>
<p>The opener arrived after 29 minutes, though. Casemiro picked off Sofian Chakla&rsquo;s pass and Modric quickly laid into the path of Benzema, who drilled through the legs of Sergio Asenjo.</p>
<p>Asenjo denied Dani Carjaval early in the second half after the full-back showed quick feet to get a left-foot shot away.</p>
<p>Madrid were gifted a golden opportunity to double the lead when Sergio Ramos tore forward and was awarded a dubious penalty when the referee judged Chakla to have clipped Los Blancos&rsquo; captain.</p>
<p>Ramos cheekily passed the ball off the spot for Benzema to score, only for the latter to have encroached, but Benzema clinically dispatched the re-take into the bottom-left corner.</p>
<p>Toni Kroos rattled the crossbar prior to Iborra&rsquo;s thumping header to set up a tense finale, in which Thibaut Courtois brilliantly saved from Bruno Soriano and Iborra in the same move.</p>
<p>Marco Asensio thought he had calmed the nerves in the final minute of added time only to be denied by the VAR, but it did little to dampen the mood of the new champions.</p>

It&rsquo;s not an easy game but a win for Real Madrid tonight will seal the La Liga title for Los Blancos for an astonishing 34th time. Best of all the game is entirely free to watch on TV and online. Find out how to watch a Real Madrid vs Villarreal free live stream below.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been two whole seasons since Real Madrid won the championship which, in Madrid years, probably feels like a lifetime. The FreeSports Player will stream the game live for free for those in the UK and Ireland. (Don&rsquo;t forget to use a VPN to access it if you&rsquo;re a UK citizen stuck abroad).</p>
<p>Real Madrid&rsquo;s four-point lead over Barca means that that Zinedine Zidane&rsquo;s side can take the La Liga title with a game to spare. They&rsquo;ve been in typically imperious form without a single dropped point in the league since their 2-2 draw with Celta Vigo back in February. Mariano, Nacho and Jovic all return to the virtually fully-fit squad for Zizou to choose from, and the big news is that Eden Hazard starts!</p>
<p>Villarreal have a sideshow of their own, of course. A win tonight for Javi Calleja&rsquo;s side would guarantee the Yellow Submarine of a Europa League spot, even if a top four place is out of the question. The visitors have a good record, winning six out of nine since the restart. They&rsquo;ll be without the goals of striker and former Barca player Paco Alcacer who is not fit to play.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Villarreal kicks off at 8pm BST.</p>

<p>UK citizens away from home or stuck abroad will need a VPN to access the the FreeSports Player from outside the UK. The service will know your location based on your IP address, and will automatically block your access – even if you’re a UK national.</p>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) helps you get around this obstacle. A VPN creates a private connection between your device and the internet, such that the servers and services you’re accessing aren’t aware of what you’re doing. All the information passing back and forth is entirely encrypted.</p>
<p>There are many VPN providers out there, with some more reliable and safe than others. As a rule, we’d suggest a paid-for service such as ExpressVPN or NordVPN.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN three months free with a year-long plan</p>
<p>You can get three months free when you sign up to a year-long plan, bringing VPN access to smart devices including the Amazon Fire TV Stick, laptops, TVs and both Android and iOS mobiles and tablets. Express also offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.View Deal</p>
<p>Once you’ve made your choice, all you need to do is sign in to your VPN service through whichever device you’d like to use to watch the match. When prompted to select a server, you need to pick one which is based in the country whose content you’d like to access. Then navigate to the relevant video streaming app or website and you’re in.</p>

Real Madrid can lift the Liga trophy at home in the Estadio Alfredo di Stéfano on Thursday evening with victory over fifth-placed Villarreal.

<p>All 10 matches are scheduled to be played at 9pm local time on Thursday evening, with decisive results possible too in the hunt for European qualification and battle against relegation.</p>
<p>Real Madrid can clinch their first LaLiga title since 2016-17, and a record 34th Spanish championship in total, when they host Villarreal CF at their temporary Alfredo Di Stefano stadium home.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane’s side have won all nine of their games since the restart from the Covid 19-break, but fifth-placed Villarreal need the points themselves to be sure of qualification for next season.</p>
<p>Four points back with just two games to play, FC know they need a victory to have any chance of keeping their hopes alive when they host 11th-placed CA Osasuna.</p>
<p>Barca have won 16 and drawn two of their 18 LaLiga home games so far this season. Osasuna’s last win at the Camp Nou came on the penultimate weekend of the 2008-09 season.</p>
<p>Sixth-placed CF are still looking to secure a return to the Europa League for 2020-21 when they host an side who last weekend secured qualification for next season’s .</p>
<p>Getafe’s last LaLiga victory over neighbours Atletico came back in 2011, they have not scored even once in 14 meetings since (13 defeats and one draw).</p>
<p>FC also confirmed their top four finish last weekend thanks to a 2-0 victory over RCD Mallorca, with the Andalusians now travelling to who with two games left are sitting in seventh spot, well set to secure another season in the Europa League next year.</p>
<p>9th-placed CF’s hopes of Uefa competition next season have slipped with just one win in their last six LaLiga games, so Los Che really need three points when they host an RCD team already planning for next season after relegation to LaLiga SmartBank was confirmed last week.</p>
<p>SD and have both been able to celebrate securing their place in LaLiga Santander for next season last weekend, so their meeting at Ipurua should be an amicable occasion, especially as Eibar coach Jose Luis Mendilibar was previously a popular boss of Valladolid.</p>
<p>D. draw against Getafe on Monday moved them four points clear of the drop zone, so they can ensure safety with a victory at a team who are already safe and with new coach Mauricio Pellegrini appointed as their new coach for 2020-21.</p>
<p>RC Celta also know that a win will ensure them of safety when they host a UD side who have already reached their objective for the season. Goals are likely at Balaidos as this fixture has averaged over four a game during the last four seasons.</p>
<p>Hoping for Alaves and Celta to slip up are CD and RCD Mallorca. 18th-placed Leganes improved their hopes of beating the drop when they beat Valencia 1-0 last weekend and really need to repeat that victory at , who themselves still have a chance of Europa League qualification.</p>
<p>19th-placed Mallorca will be fighting for their safety when they host a Granada CF team still hoping to make the Europa League.</p>
<p>Home form has been crucial in Mallorca’s attempt to escape the bottom three; they have taken six points while scoring seven goals in their last two games at Son Moix.</p>

<h3 id="real-madrid-2-1-villarreal-result-karim-benzema-double-seals-laliga-title">&ldquo;Real Madrid 2-1 Villarreal result: Karim Benzema double seals LaLiga title&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/16/21/real-madrid-160720r.jpg" alt="img">
Karim Benzema scored twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-1 and clinched the LaLiga title for the first time since 2016-17.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane’s side were two points behind Barcelona when the competition restarted last month, but headed into the penultimate round of matches four points clear of their rivals thanks to nine straight victories.</p>
<p>Los Blancos had the better of the first half at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano, but created little in attack with Eden Hazard involved intermittently on his return to the starting XI after taking a heavy knock against Espanyol last month.</p>
<p>But Madrid took the lead after Casemiro stole possession from Sofian Chakla and freed Luka Modric, who in turn set up Benzema and the French forward beat Sergio Asenjo with a low finish for his 20th LaLiga goal of the season.</p>
<p>The second half was also even, but Madrid had the chance to all but seal the title as Sergio Ramos won a contentious penalty with 15 minutes left.</p>
<p>Madrid’s skipper stepped up to shoot, but laid off for Benzema to fire home. However, the Frenchman was already inside the area before Ramos had touched the ball and Real were allowed to retake the kick despite Villarreal’s protests.</p>
<p>Benzema then fired low past Asenjo to make it 2-0, but Vicente Iborra glanced home a super header to get Villarreal back in it late on and set up a frenetic finale, in which Courtois made one super stop and Madrid also survived a goalmouth scramble.</p>
<p>Substitute Marco Asensio then saw a goal ruled out for a Benzema handball in the build-up in added time, but Madrid won out to claim the title as Barcelona lost 2-1 at home to Osasuna.</p>
