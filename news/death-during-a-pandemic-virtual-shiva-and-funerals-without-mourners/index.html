Under ordinary circumstances, Sophi Jacobs would have traveled from her home in San Francisco to Manhattan for her father’s funeral. She would have stayed with her mother for shiva, the seven-day period during which Jewish mourners stay home and receive guests. She would have been surrounded by family and friends and her father’s longtime colleagues from New York University, where he was a law professor.</p>
<p>But these are not ordinary circumstances. Her father, James Jacobs, passed away on March 19. Given the pandemic now gripping the world, she felt she could not in good conscience fly to New York.</p>
<p>“It’s painful because every piece of me wants to go be with my mother,” she said.</p>
<p>“There’s no good choice. What if I go there and pick something up on the plane and then expose my 77-year-old mother to it? And maybe I get stuck there because there are travel restrictions, and my children are stuck here without me.”</p>
<p>So Jacobs stayed home. She and about 120 friends and family connected to the funeral from afar. Rabbi Angela Buchdahl of Manhattan’s Central Synagogue, a longtime family friend, officiated via Zoom.</p>
<p>“It looked like she was in Central Synagogue, but it was just a virtual backdrop,” Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Now she’s sitting shiva. But what is shiva when most people are not leaving their homes anyway? Like so many things now, it’s virtual. Jacob’s friend Fraidy Aber has organized a series of Zoom gatherings for her, bringing new meaning to the term “shiva call.”</p>
<p>“She’s a close friend, and I was hoping to surround her with that feeling of being surrounded by love and being around people who want to give you love and honor her father,” Aber said. “It felt like the only way was to try it virtually.”</p>
<p>In some ways, Aber said, the Zoom shiva calls feel even more personal than in-person shiva gatherings. “In a shiva house there’s a lot of food and side conversations,” she said. “But because we were focused on this same Zoom call, it was more intimate. Everyone is in the same conversation. It was very collective.”</p>
<p>Jacobs feels the same way. “It’s oddly intimate,” she said. “Only one person can speak at a time, really. I thought it would be more awkward than it has been. I wish I’d been there at the funeral to hold everybody, but despite the distance it has been an intimate experience.”</p>
<p>Everything about mourning and caring for the dead has changed, says Sam Salkin, executive director of San Francisco’s Sinai Memorial Chapel, which is involved with Jewish funerals and burials all over the Bay Area.</p>
<p>“We are only doing graveside services,” he said. That means no services at Sinai’s chapels, at cemetery chapels or at synagogues.</p>
<p>Those graveside services are proceeding with some unusual modifications. There can be no more than 10 mourners, who must all stand 6 feet apart, and there are no chairs. Jewish mourners traditionally take turns putting a shovel-full of earth on the coffin once it is lowered into the grave — but that shovel is just one more object to sanitize, so mourners now have to take soil and toss it onto the coffin with their bare hands.</p>
<p>“We have two priorities with any family: kavod hameit, dignity for the deceased, and kindness for the mourners and survivors,” Salkin said. “But our highest priority right now is making sure our staff and cemetery workers are healthy and as separated from the public as possible. Because if they get sick, we can’t serve the public.”</p>
<p>Bodies are handled differently before the funeral as well. Taharah, the traditional process of preparing a body for burial, ordinarily involves washing the body by hand. “We are placing the shroud on the body and we are doing all the liturgy, but no washing,” said Salkin.</p>
<p>He is concerned about the people who prepare the bodies as well, volunteer members of the chevra kadisha, the Jewish burial society. “The majority of people who do that work are over 65, so it’s prudent to limit having them in the buildings,” Salkin said.</p>
<p>On top of all of all of those practical considerations, Salkin says that dealing with mourning families is different now, too. Rather than meeting in person, he’s working from home and meeting with them by phone.</p>
<p>“It’s harder for the family and it’s harder for us, but the families understand,” Salkin said. “I think they’re grateful that we’ve left no stone unturned. It’s not how they would have imagined or liked it to be, but they’re respectful.”</p>
<p>Sinai has a policy of always doing burials of indigent Jews pro bono, so they’re used to dealing with financial hardship in making funeral arrangements. They haven’t yet had to do any burials for families that have had a loss of job or business due to coronavirus restrictions, but they anticipate that will happen eventually.</p>
<p>“We’re prepared,” Salkin said. “We’ll be able to work with families given their particular situation.”</p>
<p>He said they’re also preparing for the possibility of families losing more than one person in close succession as the pandemic worsens.</p>
<p>“Under normal circumstances, it’s our job to think of everything so people can deal with their loss and don’t have to worry about the details,” Salkin said. “And in this time in particular, we really do have to think of everything.”</p>
<p>As for Jacobs, she is dealing with her loss as best she can, and taking solace in the fact that her father would be amused by his unusual funeral. “He was not the most technologically adept,” she recalled. “But he had such a wonder at every new thing. ‘Oh, that’s fabulous!’ he’d say. ‘Unbelievable!’”</p>
<p>With a laugh, she added, “My dad would be so tickled that he was at the forefront of funeral technology.”

coronavirus</p>
<p>Posted Wednesday, March 25, 2020 12:00 am</p>
<p>After Shaul Moshi died last week in Los Angeles at the age of 94, over 100 people gathered at his home for the traditional shiva minyan.</p>
<p>It was Wednesday night — before the synagogues and schools had closed, before bars and restaurants had drained of customers, and before the city had enacted a sweeping ban on gatherings of more than 50 people due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>For a few days, the traditional home-based Jewish mourning rituals proceeded as normal, with visitors gathering to comfort Moshi’s wife and children, and provide the 10 Jews necessary to recite the Mourner’s Kaddish.</p>
<p>But by the weekend, those staples of the Jewish grieving process were looking increasingly like acts of recklessness as large swaths of the country went into varying degrees of lockdown in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19. Prayer services were moved to another family home and Moshi’s elderly wife and daughter finished out the weeklong shiva largely alone — visited only by a handful of close family and unable to recite the Kaddish.</p>
<p>“There’s this feeling of you want to be with the family,” said David Abrahams, Moshi’s son-in-law. “You want to have the comfort. You want to hold on to each other at a time like this.”</p>
<p>Jewish mourning rituals entail instant creation of a social cocoon, as the bereaved typically retreat to their homes for the shiva and friends and families swarm them with visits and food. But as the coronavirus upends ever more aspects of daily life and social distancing becomes the order of the day, such basic human acts as comforting the bereaved have virtually overnight become significant threats to public health.</p>
<p>Across the country, rabbis have urged that all home visits be stopped and the traditional shiva visit be made only by phone or internet, leading to heartbreaking stories of families forced to grieve in physical isolation and denied the comfort of religious mourning rituals.</p>
<p>In Long Island’s Huntington Station 90-year-old Holocaust survivor Gerda Garbatzky began showing signs of illness on Thursday, was admitted to the hospital on Friday night and was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Sunday evening. The whole time, she was kept in isolation and forbidden to have visitors. After she died on Monday, her daughter and grandson, both in quarantine themselves, were unable to reach out to each other for comfort and had to make do with a videoconference.</p>
<p>“Normally we’d sit in the same room crying, holding hands. We’re a very close family,” Garbatzky’s grandson Geoffrey Sorensen said. “We couldn’t do that. I just wanted to hug my parents. We did a video chat just so we could see each other crying, which sounds so terrible, but I just needed to see them.”</p>
<p>In Chicago, an elderly Holocaust survivor sitting shiva for his wife had visitors sign up for visitation slots — limiting them to five people at a time and asking them to keep their distance in the home. Eventually, even that seemed like a risk he was no longer willing to bear.</p>
<p>“They’re just too scared about all these seemingly healthy people traipsing through the apartment with this pandemic going on,” said Rabbi David Wolkenfeld, the family’s rabbi. “It’s sad on so many levels. The family doesn’t get the typical support and embrace and a hug of a community which you really need, and we expect from Jews, to get through these really hard times.”</p>
<p>Those mourning parents are obligated to say Kaddish daily for 11 months. Jewish law requires a minyan for the recitation of the prayer, and those mourners must be gathered in one physical place, not online, although others may gather from afar.</p>
<p>Even bigger challenges for Jewish burial rituals could lie ahead. In Italy, where the coronavirus has hit hard, funerals for some victims reportedly have been postponed. If the coronavirus death toll grows in the United States or Israel, finding enough volunteers to guard bodies before burial, as Jewish ritual requires, could become difficult.</p>
<p>For now, grieving Jews are reckoning with changes that are unfolding with almost unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>Shalom Freedman flew from his home in New Jersey to Denver for his mother’s funeral last Wednesday. He had planned to return to complete the shiva period with his family, but his rabbi advised him to stay put since home gatherings by then had been banned in New Jersey and he would be unable to recite the Kaddish prayer.</p>
<p>“Not being able to say Kaddish is going to be quite hard,” acknowledged Freedman, who plans to return east later this week. “But people have been calling in for support. That really helps.”

<h3 id="shiva-baby-review-a-sugar-daddy-crashes-a-jewish-funeral-in-this-lively-queer-comedy">‘Shiva Baby’ Review: A Sugar Daddy Crashes a Jewish Funeral in This Lively Queer Comedy</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shiva-baby-185176.jpg" alt="img">
SXSW: Polly Draper&rsquo;s refreshing take on a Jewish mother brightens Emma Seligman&rsquo;s debut feature, which mines a wild premise for dark laughs.</p>
<p>While the 2020 SXSW Film Festival has been canceled, IndieWire is covering select titles from this year’s edition.</p>
<p>As probably the single most stigmatized profession, sex work and have long held a salacious fascination for filmmakers. From “Pretty Woman” to “True Romance,” sex workers are either depicted as the “hooker with the heart of gold” or a damsel in distress needing salvation (typically from a man). It wasn’t until recently that filmmakers started creating more nuanced takes on the world’s oldest profession, embracing sex workers as fully autonomous characters who don’t all secretly hate what they do or long to be rescued.</p>
<p>Films such as “Cam” (Netflix) and TV shows like “Harlots” (Hulu) and “The Girlfriend Experience” (Starz) each move beyond tired tropes seeking only titillation or pity for its sex worker characters. As discussion of sex worker rights moves into mainstream feminist dialogues, entertainment media has thankfully followed suit. Entering fearlessly into this fledgling genre is “Shiva Baby,” a sharp-witted dark comedy from first-time feature writer/director Emma Seligman. Bearing a likeness to the early work of Jill Soloway and Jennifer Westfeldt, “Shiva Baby” blends a claustrophobic Jewish humor with a sexy premise to deliver a lively debut.</p>
<p>The film opens with a young woman Danielle (Rachel Sennott) finishing up a session with her sugar daddy Max (Danny Deferrari). Deferrari communicates everything you need to know about his character in this early scene — after fumbling with the cash, he extends an already awkward farewell into an even sadder extended hug. Brushing him off brusquely, Danielle arrives late to a family shiva (a Jewish funeral service), though she’s still not sure who died.</p>
<p>Popular on IndieWire</p>
<p>Exuding Jewish parental charm sans all the tired cliches are Joel (Fred Melamed) and Debbie (Polly Draper). These two comedy mainstays have stuck around long enough to both enjoy indie icon status (Draper for “Thirtysomething” and “Obvious Child,” Melamed most notably for his work with the Coen brothers). They make a truly delightful duo as Danielle’s lovingly overbearing parents, but Draper’s Debbie is a particular breath of fresh air from the typical Jewish mother trope. In contrast to the maternal narcissism of “Transparent” or “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” Debbie seems to actually put her daughter’s well-being ahead of her own self-interest, and it doesn’t make her any less funny.</p>
<p>SXSW</p>
<p>On the contrary, she has some of the movie’s best lines, such as when she laments, “He’s married to a shiksa princess. Poor guy.” Or when she chides Danielle, “You are flirting with everyone, you are chugging your wine, you are sitting on a table! This isn’t a party!”</p>
<p>Granted, Danielle can be forgiven for chugging wine, since Max shows up at the shiva. It turns out, her sugar daddy used to work for her real daddy. Not only that, he’s married (to a shiksa). And they have a baby. Not only does she have to process this personal crisis in secret, but amidst a chorus of nosy Jewish aunties simultaneously chastising and praising her recent weight loss. What’s more, her high school sweetheart Maya (Molly Gordon) — or is she her sworn enemy? — is going to law school, while Danielle is totally directionless.</p>
<p>Seligman’s script is witty and pithy, with only a few lags in the action. The single setting is always a shrewd move for a first feature, especially one on a budget, though it does limit things visually. The conversational nature of the script lends itself to tight shots and quick edits, which has the effect of running suffocating circles around Danielle, who is usually centered while the other characters are shot over the shoulder, helping keep the focus on her inner turmoil. A tense string score ratchets up the tension, though this technique loses its bite after a few too many uses.</p>
<p>Maya and Danielle’s relationship, while much fretted about by busybody elders, is the film’s sweetest point. The two ping pong from bickering schoolgirls to flirty exes in flash before sharing what has got to be the hottest kiss any shiva ever inspired. Gordon, who charmed as the smarty who partied in “Booksmart,” does much of the heavy lifting here. As the more emotionally forward of the two, her swooning eyes and sheepish smiles are enough to flip anyone’s stomach — in a good way. Sennott is harder to pin down, bouncing between an opaque detachment and a frenetic inner panic. Both qualities make her a tough character to connect with, and hence care about.</p>
<p>“Shiva Baby” is strongest when viewed as an ensemble film, and the whirling energy surrounding Danielle in her hour of panic is what makes the film so engaging. Danielle is the eye of the hurricane, albeit not a calm one by any means, but it’s the bickering parents, deaf old ladies, and kibitzing neighbors that make it sing. As the old Jewish proverb says, it takes a village to raise a “Shiva Baby.”</p>
<p>Grade: B</p>
<p>“Shiva Baby” was scheduled to premiere at SXSW 2020. It is currently seeking distribution.</p>
