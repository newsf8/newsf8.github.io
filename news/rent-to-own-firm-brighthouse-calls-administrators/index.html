<p>Rent-to-own giant BrightHouse is close to collapse, the BBC understands, putting 2,400 jobs at risk.</p>
<p>The company is expected to fall into administration on Monday after facing an influx of compensation claims for selling to people who could not repay.</p>
<p>Stricter lending rules had put the business under strain long before shops were closed owing to coronavirus.</p>
<p>BrightHouse has 200,000 customers and is the largest operator in the rent-to-own sector.</p>
<p>Rent-to-own customers make monthly payments for household items, in effect renting goods until they have paid in full. Many are on low incomes and find it difficult to access credit from mainstream lenders to pay for fridges, TVs, washing machines and other electrical items.</p>
<p>What should customers do?</p>
<p>BrightHouse customers, about a third of whom are in work, will continue with payments, even if the company goes into administration.</p>
<p>Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes the Debt Camel blog, said: &ldquo;Now the company is expected to go into administration, customers need to think if they can manage to make the repayments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If their income has fallen because of coronavirus, they should ask for a payment break. And if the item is just too expensive, they should ask for a lower payment arrangement. They may be able to make an affordability complaint and get a refund of the interest they have paid on previous items.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expected collapse, first reported by Sky News, would see 240 shops close unless a buyer is found.</p>
<p>In January, the business said it was under pressure from dealing with mis-selling claims.</p>
<p>Alongside many other lenders of high-cost credit, the company was being challenged by people who said they were given credit when they would never have been able to afford the repayments.</p>
<p>This came after rules, introduced last year, which restricted the cost of rent-to-own, following claims of spiralling debts.</p>
<p>How much have people paid?</p>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, ruled that interest charged would be capped to as much as the cost of the product.</p>
<p>Prices were also controlled, with shops only able to charge no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers, including delivery and installation charges.</p>
<p>Shops were also prevented from increasing their prices for insurance premiums, extended warranties, or arrears charges, to recoup lost revenue from the price cap.</p>
<p>Before the rules were brought in, spiralling interest charges meant some rent-to-own consumers had ended up paying more than four times the retail price they would have paid in normal shops.

<h3 id="rent-to-buy-retailer-brighthouse-with-branches-across-kent-set-to-enter-administration">Rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, with branches across Kent set to &lsquo;enter administration&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/_media/img/LF35FXPSLFV4I1V2OGDF.jpg" alt="img">
BrightHouse, the largest &lsquo;rent-to-own&rsquo; retailer in the UK is thought to be on the verge of going into administration next week.</p>
<p>According to reports, the retailer, which has struggled in recent years, is thought to have been toppled over the edge by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>BrightHouse could be one of the first major retailers to collapse as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, after struggling for several years</p>
<p>It forced the firm to close all its stores - including its branches in Kent, which includes outlets in Margate, Folkestone, Ashford, Chatham, Dover, Ramsgate and Dartford.</p>
<p>It will be yet another blow to the high street with non-essential traders facing cash-flow problems as a result of being forced to shut.</p>
<p>It is understood the potential collapse of the firm, which offers pay-per-week deals on a host of household items, will put 2,400 jobs, nationwide, at risk.</p>
<p>The company came in for criticism in the past for the high price of goods paid for over extended periods due to interest payments.</p>
<p>In 2017, it was ordered to pay almost 250,000 customers £14.8million in compensation after it failed to be a &ldquo;responsible lender&rdquo; according to the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
<p>BrightHouse is thought to be entering administration as soon as next week</p>
<p>Any collapse could reduce the amounts many are still waiting on.</p>
<p>And those who are currently paying off products bought via BrightHouse will have to continue to do so, with administrators likely to oversee the payments, with the loans likely to be sold on to another lender.</p>
<p>Sky News is reporting accountancy firm Grant Thornton will oversee the administration which could come as soon as Monday.</p>
<p>KentOnline contacted BrightHouse but a spokesman said it had &ldquo;no comment to make&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Branches in Maidstone and Gravesend closed as part of an earlier restructuring in 2019.</p>

<h3 id="more-crawley-jobs-at-risk-as-brighthouse-close-to-collapse">More Crawley jobs at risk as BrightHouse close to collapse</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.crawleynews24.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/brighthouse-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
The largest rent-to-own retailer which has a store in Queens Sq, Crawley is likely to fall into administration on Monday.</p>
<p>The firm is the largest operator of its kind in the sector and provides loans to its customers so they can purchase electrical items. It reportedly has 200,000 customers and as many as 2,400 staff could be affected across the country.</p>
<p>Customers make monthly payments for these electrical items, renting them until they are fully paid for.</p>
<p>If the firm does go into administration then any customers who have already issued complaints over mis-selling could find that they only end up receiving just a fraction of the amount they hoped for.</p>
<p>The firm closed the stores for health and safety reasons around COVID-19 several days ago.</p>
<p>But customers of Brighthouse are also being warned that they even if the company does go into administration they still need to keep up their monthly payments and in the light of the coronavirus, with many of the cutsomers falling into the low income bracket, many are being encuoraged to ask for payment breaks.
