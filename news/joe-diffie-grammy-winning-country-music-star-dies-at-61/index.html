Joe Diffie, a country singer who had a string of hits in the 1990s with chart-topping ballads and honky-tonk singles like “Home” and “Pickup Man,” died on Sunday in Nashville. He was 61.</p>
<p>He announced on Friday that he had contracted the coronavirus, becoming the first country star to go public with such a diagnosis. His publicist, Scott Adkins, confirmed his death.</p>
<p>Mr. Diffie was a member of the Grand Ole Opry for more than 25 years. His hits included “Honky Tonk Attitude,” “Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die),” “Bigger Than the Beatles” and “If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets).”

<h3 id="top-10-joe-diffie-songs">Top 10 Joe Diffie Songs</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2020/03/joe-diffie-songs-list.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
Joe Diffie&rsquo;s songs weren&rsquo;t the biggest hits of the 1990s, and he wasn&rsquo;t the &rsquo;90s most well-known country star, but in so many ways he defined the decade with lyrics born out of the American experience and a simple, straight-forward and often clever approach to storytelling.</p>
<p>Diffie, who died on Sunday (March 29) at age 61 after a short battle with coronavirus, was a &rsquo;90s staple, but several songs on this list of Top 10 Joe Diffie Songs come from the early 2000s, when he was something of a different artist. He notched five No. 1 singles on Billboard&rsquo;s Country Airplay chart and 17 Top 10 hits. Two of his albums Honky Tonk Attitude and Third Rock from the Sun were certified Platinum, and several deeper cuts (or at least less commercially successful singles) became staples in his live show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home&rdquo; was Diffie&rsquo;s first No. 1 hit and his debut single from A Thousand Winding Roads, released in 1990. His career took off from there, with a string of six-straight Top 10 hits. &ldquo;Third Rock from the Sun&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pickup Man&rdquo; are two songs that came in the mid-&rsquo;90s, off of his fourth studio album Third Rock from the Sun. A couple years later, a television show of the same name would become a hit in America.</p>
<p>Diffie&rsquo;s popularity on radio stations had started to wane by the late &rsquo;90s and early &rsquo;00s as more pop-friendly sounds began to dominate, and that wasn&rsquo;t something he was made for. Still, he continued to produce music, and fine music at that. The 2004 Top 20 single &ldquo;Tougher Than Nails&rdquo; is worth revisiting in full, as there Diffie showcased an ability to cover Christian music with the same honesty as he did songs about trucks, heartbreak and love.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t listen to each of the songs on this playlist, at least read a few sentences about the best Joe Diffie songs to appreciate what he contributed America&rsquo;s catalog. Diffie continued to perform until his final weeks, often with friends and fellow &rsquo;90s stars in front of and behind him.</p>
<p>In 2012, Jason Aldean tributed Diffie heavily in a song called &ldquo;1994&rdquo; that referred to several of native Oklahoman&rsquo;s songs. We put that song at the end of our playlist.</p>

<p>Days after announcing he had tested positive for the coronavirus, Grammy-winning country singer Joe Diffie died on Sunday, his family announced on social media.</p>
<p>Diffie, 61, is one of the highest-profile celebrities to die after testing positive for COVID-19. Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally died last week in a Sarasota hospital following complications related to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>An Oklahoma native, Diffie was a fixture on ’90s-country radio, scoring some of the era’s defining hits: Pickup Man, Third Rock From the Sun, Home, John Deere Green, If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets) and Bigger Than the Beatles, to name a few.</p>
<p>In 1999 he won a Grammy Award for the single Same Old Train, a collaboration with artists including Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Earl Scruggs and more. Before that, he won the Country Music Association’s Vocal Event of the Year trophy for his work on George Jones’ I Don’t Need No Rockin’ Chair.</p>
<p>Diffie’s songs, full of humor and humanity, became such a distinct part of country music’s ’90s boom that younger artists like Jason Aldean (1994) and Chris Young (Raised On Country) name-dropped Diffie in their lyrics.</p>
<p>“Pickup Man is a classic,” Young told the Tampa Bay Times last fall. “It’s going to be tough to find anyone who doesn’t know the words to that song. Is It Cold in Here, Ships That Don’t Come In — you put that on in any bar right now in Nashville, everybody’s going to sing along with them. These guys were staples in that time period. Obviously, you go to the guys that are without-a-doubts, like George Strait and Alan Jackson. Then when you get to somebody else that a lot of people reference, that just shows how enduring his music is.”</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Diffie had commented on the coronavirus on social media. On March 11, he posted a photo of crafting, out-of-school children at his house, saying he “apparently homeschooled 13 kids today.”</p>
<p>On March 18, he posted about a run of concert cancellations caused by the coronavirus. He was scheduled to play the Dallas bull in Tampa on May 15.</p>
<p>“I just want to say to all the fans, the show cancellations are not my idea of a good time,” he wrote. “Promoters, venues etc are postponing these events, as expected with everything going on. These shows that are postponed are affecting all of us musicians and our bands, crews, drivers, etc. Please pray for all of us and hope we can get america back on track and back to normal.”</p>
<p>On Friday, he Instagrammed that he had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We want to remind the public and all my fans to be vigilant, cautious and careful during this pandemic,” he wrote.</p>
<p>On Sunday, his wife Tara took over his Instagram account, posting a screenshot of the announcement on his Facebook page.</p>
<p>“It’s with a sad heart that i have to post this,” she wrote.</p>
