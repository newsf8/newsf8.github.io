<p>Five years after kicking off a massive phase 3 program, Bayer has good news for finerenone. The drug beat placebo at staving off progression of kidney disease and lowered the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The study, known as FIDELIO-DKD, is part of a program pitting finerenone against placebo in 13,000 patients with varying severities of kidney disease from early to advanced. Patients received a 10-mg or 20-mg dose of finerenone or placebo on top of the standard of care for CKD. Treatments can include ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers to slow down kidney disease as well as drugs to lower blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Finerenone beat placebo at staving off kidney failure—when patients need dialysis or a transplant to survive—death from kidney disease or slowing decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, namely the rate at which the kidneys could filter blood.</p>
<p>RELATED: Novo Nordisk bets $725M on heart-focused Corvidia—with the promise of $1.4B more</p>
<p>It also hit a key secondary endpoint, prolonging time to death from heart disease, or time to nonfatal cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart attack or hospitalization because of heart failure. Bayer will present full data at an upcoming medical meeting. A second phase 3 study, FIGARO-DKD, is slated to read out next year.</p>
<p>Bayer is also testing the drug in a 5,500-patient study to see whether it can beat placebo at keeping patients alive and reducing hospitalizations or urgent visits for heart failure.</p>
<p>Finerenone is a next-generation mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or MRA, designed to block the production of steroids in the body that degrade heart function and lead to kidney problems. Older MRAs are already used to control high blood pressure and tamp down on inflammation and scarring that come with diabetic kidney disease, but their use is limited.</p>
<p>RELATED: Bayer takes its heart-failure drug into Phase III after a mid-stage success</p>
<p>“Safety concerns mean that existing MRAs are only used as a last resort—Pfizer’s Inspra or the older spironolactone are examples—and Bayer is hoping to show that finerenone is an entirely different proposition,” Evaluate wrote earlier this year. Bayer believes its non-steroidal nature and better selectivity should lead to fewer side effects, including very high potassium levels.</p>
<p>Evaluate called the phase 3 program a “bold bet” but one with a potentially dwindling likelihood of paying off. Though cross-trial comparisons are always tricky, the finerenone data will be held up against the record of Invokana, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s SGLT2 inhibitor.</p>
<p>The FDA slapped the diabetes med with a black box warning for amputation risks in 2017 but went ahead and OK’d it for diabetic kidney disease last September, making it the first drug of its class for this indication. In a pivotal trial, Invokana reduced the risk of end-stage kidney disease by 32% and tamped down on cardiovascular events by 20% to 30%. Evaluate expects SGLT2 drugs from AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly to turn up similar results.

<h3 id="astrazenecas-farxiga-backs-up-kidney-disease-trial-stop-with-new-top-line-data">&ldquo;AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Farxiga backs up kidney disease trial stop with new top-line data&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://qtxasset.com/fiercepharma/1595942294/Farxiga.jpg/Farxiga.jpg?Fb.ISDQeAdkTV3S84u6sl0c_DaHOswgL" alt="img">
AstraZeneca has shaken up the lucrative heart failure market with diabetes med Farxiga after a major approval earlier this year. But in kidney disease, another blockbuster market, Farxiga also sports promising data, and it could spell a big FDA nod to come.</p>
<p>Farxiga hit its primary endpoint of decreased kidney function, end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular death in a pivotal phase 3 trial for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), according to top-line data released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The top-line results come months after AstraZeneca halted its Dapa-CKD trial when interim data &ldquo;showed Farxiga&rsquo;s benefits earlier than originally anticipated,&rdquo; the drugmaker said in March.</p>
<p>Farxiga not only cut CKD patients&rsquo; serious risk factors, but the SGLT2 inhibitor also hit its secondary endpoints in patients with or without Type 2 diabetes, including reducing death from any cause, making Farxiga the first medicine to cut the risk of death in that patient population, AstraZeneca said.</p>
<p>The British drugmaker plans to present the full results of the study at an upcoming medical meeting, it said.</p>
<p>A major win in CKD, which is believed to affect 700,000 U.S. patients each year, puts Farxiga in good position to challenge Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s Jardiance—which is also chasing a CKD approval—and Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s Invokana, which already has a kidney disease nod.</p>

<p>A coronavirus patient who nearly died twice after his heart stopped is still suffering the after effects of battling the virus months after being released from hospital.</p>
<p>Scott Howell, 48, from Wyllie, near Blackwood, was the first coronavirus patients to be placed in intensive care at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport and was placed in an induced coma for more than two weeks while his body battled the virus.</p>
<p>Sitting in the garden of his three-storey home he shares with his wife Helen and four children, Scott looks as though all is well with the world but the civil servant is still coming to terms with the life-threatening experience he went through.</p>
<p>Despite being able to enjoy family walks and the occasional visit to the pub garden, he is still suffering with heart and kidney issues as well as PTSD from the mental strain the virus placed upon him.</p>
<p>Describing his first symptoms, Scott said: &ldquo;On March 5 I went to work as usual. I climbed the stairs but when I got to the top I was out of breath and had a cough that got progressively worse. The next day I went for a spa day up Bryn Meadows but I was too ill and had to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same night Scott was admitted to Ystrad Mynach Hospital where he was diagnosed with double pneumonia which developed into sepsis.</p>
<p>He was transferred to the Royal Gwent and on March 9 he was placed in an induced coma which he remained in for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Scott said: &ldquo;My heart stopped on two different occasions when I was in a coma, once when they tried to put a tracheotomy in. I was on kidney dialysis and my kidneys are still not right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On April 13 I was moved to a cardiac ward because I had heart failure. My wife had to be the strong one, she was receiving phone calls saying that they didn&rsquo;t think I was going to pull through that night. She didn&rsquo;t have just me to worry about, she had four kids to look after as well.</p>
<p>(Image: WalesOnline/Rob Browne)</p>
<p>(Image: WalesOnline/Rob Browne)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I experienced a number of dreams about about being captured and being worked on in underground secret laboratories and the NHS were giving me secret drugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another dream I was asked to fix the US presidential race so Donald Trump run again. They put £400m in my bank account and if I didn&rsquo;t use it to win the election they would kill me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken to lots of Covid patients and they have all had similar dream about being chased or experimented on so it would appear that&rsquo;s common for people who were in intensive care with Covid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t able to have any visitors and even when I was Face-timing them it was short because I didn&rsquo;t have the strength to hold the iPad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hospital staff were a fantastic team, they got me from being a head in a bed because I couldn&rsquo;t move my arms and legs and couldn&rsquo;t move myself up the bed if I slipped down. Within two weeks they got me walking up a flight of stairs which was just enough for me to come home on April 29.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott was filmed leaving the hospital on a wheelchair to applause and cheers from hospital staff who had made such a vital contribution to saving his life, but despite winning one battle he had another to contend with at home.</p>

<p>He said: &ldquo;When I first came out I had to move my bedroom downstairs because I couldn&rsquo;t climb two flights of stairs. I was in there for a couple of weeks. I couldn&rsquo;t shower myself and had to have a riser for the toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife was fantastic she helped me to dress and shave. Since then it&rsquo;s back to normal but I can&rsquo;t lift things and have to take it easy. If I have things delivered I can&rsquo;t lift it or carry the shopping but it&rsquo;s all part of the recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on a physiotherapy programme, the prognosis is that it could take between six and 12 months recovery time. My heart rate is still not where they would like it to be. It&rsquo;s pumping at 38% when it should be at 60% and my kidneys are not right. One of the only things I struggle with is walking down the stairs one foot at a time. I&rsquo;m hoping within six months I&rsquo;ll be back in work and back to normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Welsh Government gradually ease coronavirus restrictions, more and more people are returning to some kind of normality but Scott remains concerned that some people are not taken the virus seriously enough.</p>
<p>In one unbelievable encounter, he was told by a group of people who heard about his illness that coronavirus was &ldquo;a hoax&rdquo; and a conspiracy.</p>
<p>(Image: WalesOnline/Rob Browne)</p>
<p>Scott said: &ldquo;I went to my local pub last Friday, the first time I could be up there, and as I came outside to use the toilet one of my neighbours asked me to tell this group what happened to me and the whole table were convinced I didn&rsquo;t have Covid and that it didn&rsquo;t exist and I was just shaking my head. It&rsquo;s incredulous people like that exist. I found that unbelievable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It frustrates me to see younger people partying with no social distancing and not wearing masks thinking they&rsquo;re invincible and the virus won&rsquo;t get to them. It&rsquo;s not the flu, youngsters as well as older people who can die from it. People still come near me and close to me and I have to ask them to step back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have walked to the local pub to sit outside and there were tables sat together who are not in bubbles because they believe it&rsquo;s not going to get them. It&rsquo;s a non-discriminating disease, it will affect youngsters as well as people without underlying health issues. I want to scream and shout &lsquo;please get away from each other&rsquo; and use a bit of sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had given Covid-19 to my wife and all the members of my family apart from my kids. I gave it to 26 people in total. I have type two diabetes and asthma which is why the doctors think it affected me so bad but my wife had no symptoms so you can be asymptomatic and pass it on to your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the experience of battling coronavirus has taken its toll on Scott&rsquo;s physical and mental health, he said the illness has taught to appreciate the simpler things in life and has changed his priorities.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in hospital and you have had a life changing experience, it changes your outlook. I was previously a massive fan of work and worked long hours but it&rsquo;s not longer my number one priority. Being able to walk in the fresh air and being able to spend time with friends and family, those are key priorities. It&rsquo;s all about the time you spend with them.</p>
<p>(Image: WalesOnline/Rob Browne)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has massively changed my outlook on life. I don&rsquo;t care about money and I don&rsquo;t care where we go on holiday, it&rsquo;s about spending time with family and spending time in the outdoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott also wished to pay tribute to the staff at the Royal Gwent and the NHS in general for saving his life and keeping his recovery on track.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only here because of the great work the NHS has done for me especially staff from the ICU and physiotherapy units at the Royal Gwent. My thanks go out to them for what they have done for me. I can only admire the level of care and professionalism of the staff from the cleaners to the physiotherapists which is phenomenal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I truly believe I wasn&rsquo;t going to walk for 12 months but they got me back up and walking. I have had a tremendous amount of care and I can&rsquo;t estimate if I had been in the States how much it would have cost but the NHS is free. I will always be grateful for what they have done.&rdquo;

<h3 id="from-brain-fog-to-heart-damage-covid-19s-lingering-problems-alarm-scientists">&ldquo;From ‘brain fog’ to heart damage, COVID-19’s lingering problems alarm scientists&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/ma_0807_NF_CovidLongterm_Athena.jpg?itok=0LI4KC-s" alt="img">
From ‘brain fog’ to heart damage, COVID-19’s lingering problems alarm scientists</p>
<p>Science ’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Heising-Simons Foundation.</p>
<p>Athena Akrami’s neuroscience lab reopened last month without her. Life for the 38-year-old is a pale shadow of what it was before 17 March, the day she first experienced symptoms of the novel coronavirus. At University College London (UCL), Akrami’s students probe how the brain organizes memories to support learning, but at home, she struggles to think clearly and battles joint and muscle pain. “I used to go to the gym three times a week,” Akrami says. Now, “My physical activity is bed to couch, maybe couch to kitchen.”</p>
<p>Her early symptoms were textbook for COVID-19: a fever and cough, followed by shortness of breath, chest pain, and extreme fatigue. For weeks, she struggled to heal at home. But rather than ebb with time, Akrami’s symptoms waxed and waned without ever going away. She’s had just 3 weeks since March when her body temperature was normal.</p>
<p>“Everybody talks about a binary situation, you either get it mild and recover quickly, or you get really sick and wind up in the ICU,” says Akrami, who falls into neither category. Thousands echo her story in online COVID-19 support groups. Outpatient clinics for survivors are springing up, and some are already overburdened. Akrami has been waiting more than 4 weeks to be seen at one of them, despite a referral from her general practitioner.</p>
<p>The list of lingering maladies from COVID-19 is longer and more varied than most doctors could have imagined. Ongoing problems include fatigue, a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, achy joints, foggy thinking, a persistent loss of sense of smell, and damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain.</p>
<p>The likelihood of a patient developing persistent symptoms is hard to pin down because different studies track different outcomes and follow survivors for different lengths of time. One group in Italy found that 87% of a patient cohort hospitalized for acute COVID-19 was still struggling 2 months later. Data from the COVID Symptom Study, which uses an app into which millions of people in the United States, United Kingdom, and Sweden have tapped their symptoms, suggest 10% to 15% of people—including some “mild” cases—don’t quickly recover. But with the crisis just months old, no one knows how far into the future symptoms will endure, and whether COVID-19 will prompt the onset of chronic diseases.</p>

<p>Researchers are now facing a familiar COVID-19 narrative: trying to make sense of a mystifying illness. Distinct features of the virus, including its propensity to cause widespread inflammation and blood clotting, could play a role in the assortment of concerns now surfacing. “We’re seeing a really complex group of ongoing symptoms,” says Rachael Evans, a pulmonologist at the University of Leicester.</p>
<p>Survivor studies are starting to probe them. This month, researchers across the United Kingdom including Evans launched a study that will follow 10,000 survivors for 1 year to start, and up to 25 years. Ultimately, researchers hope not just to understand the disease’s long shadow, but also to predict who’s at highest risk of lingering symptoms and learn whether treatments in the acute phase of illness can head them off.</p>
<p>For Götz Martin Richter, a radiologist at the Klinikum Stuttgart in Germany, what’s especially striking is that just as the illness’ acute symptoms vary unpredictably, so, too, do those that linger. Richter thinks of two patients he has treated: a middle-aged man who experienced mild pneumonia from COVID-19, and an elderly woman already suffering from chronic leukemia and arterial disease, who almost died from the virus and had to be resuscitated. Three months later, the man with the mild case “falls asleep all day long and cannot work,” Richter says. The woman has minimal lung damage and feels fine.</p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, doctors learned that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can disrupt a breathtaking array of tissues in the body. Like a key fitting neatly into a lock, SARS-CoV-2 uses a spike protein on its surface to latch onto cells’ ACE2 receptors. The lungs, heart, gut, kidneys, blood vessels, and nervous system, among other tissues, carry ACE2 on their cells’ surfaces—and thus, are vulnerable to COVID-19. The virus can also induce a dramatic inflammatory reaction, including in the brain. Often, “The danger comes when the body responds out of proportion to the infection,” says Adrija Hajra, a physician at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. She continues to care for those who were infected in the spring and are still recovering.</p>
<p>Despite the novelty of SARS-CoV-2, its long-term effects have precedents: Infections with other pathogens are associated with lasting impacts ranging from heart problems to chronic fatigue. “Medicine has been used to dealing with this problem” of acute viral illness followed by ongoing symptoms, says Michael Zandi, a neurologist at UCL. Even common illnesses such as pneumonia can mean a monthslong recovery. “I see a lot of people who had [the brain inflammation] encephalitis 3, 4 years ago, and still can’t think, or are tired,” Zandi says. Infections with certain bacteria and Zika virus, among others, are linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, in which the immune system attacks nerve tissue, causing tingling, weakness, and paralysis. (Some cases of Guillain-Barre after COVID-19 have been reported, but “it’s not definite [there’s] a spike,” says Rachel Brown, a UCL neurologist who works with Zandi.)</p>
<p>Pain that lingers A subset of COVID-19 patients experiences ongoing symptoms and complications such as organ damage, and researchers are proposing reasons for some of them (bottom). Scientists are trying to identify such symptoms, how common they are, how long they last, who’s at risk, and how to treat and prevent them. 1 Joint pain Chest pain Skin rash Cough Fatigue Headache Insomnia Vertigo 2 3 4 Persistent fever 1 Brain fog Difficulty thinking can occur after acute COVID-19 infection. The virus may damage brain cells, and inflammation in the brain or body may also cause neurologic complications. Other viral infections can also lead to brain fog. 2 Shortness of breath Doctors are eyeing lung and heart complications including scarring. Patients who become critically ill with COVID-19 seem more likely to have lingering shortness of breath, but those with mild cases are also at risk. 3 Heart arrhythmia The virus can harm the heart, and doctors are concerned about long-term damage. How the heart heals after COVID-19 could help determine whether a patient develops an irregular heartbeat. 4 Hypertension Some patients have high blood pressure after an acute infection, even when cases were relatively mild and people were previously healthy, possibly because the virus targets blood vessels and heart cells.</p>
<p>Based on experience with other viruses, doctors can “extrapolate and anticipate” potential long-term effects of COVID-19, says Jeffrey Goldberger, chief of cardiology at the University of Miami. Like SARS-CoV-2, some other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr, can damage heart tissue, for example. In those infections, the organ sometimes heals completely. Sometimes, scarring is mild. “Or,” Goldberger says, “it could be severe and lead to heart failure.”</p>
<p>Michael Marks, an infectious disease specialist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine who’s helping lead the U.K. survivor study, says he’s not too surprised at emerging aftereffects. “What we’re experiencing is an epidemic of severe illness,” he says. “So therefore, there is an epidemic” of chronic illness that follows it.</p>
<p>But outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 also appear distinct in ways both hopeful and dispiriting. Early this year, many doctors feared the virus would induce extensive, permanent lung damage in many survivors because two other coronaviruses, the viruses that cause the first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, can devastate the lungs. One study of health care workers with SARS in 2003 found that those with lung lesions 1 year after infection still had them after 15 years.</p>
<p>“We expected to see a lot of long-term damage from COVID-19: scarring, decreased lung function, decreased exercise capacity,” says Ali Gholamrezanezhad, a radiologist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California who in mid-January began to review lung scans from COVID-19 patients in Asia. Hundreds of scans later, he has concluded that COVID-19 ravages the lungs less consistently and aggressively than SARS did, when about 20% of patients sustained lasting lung damage. “COVID-19 is in general a milder disease,” he says.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sheer breadth of complications linked to COVID-19 is mind-boggling. In late April, Akrami collaborated with Body Politic, a group of COVID-19 survivors, to survey more than 600 who still had symptoms after 2 weeks. She logged 62 different symptoms and is now readying the findings for publication and developing a second survey to capture longer term ailments. “Even though it’s one virus, it can cause all different kinds of diseases in people,” says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who is studying lingering effects on the immune system.</p>
<p>By now it’s clear that many people with COVID-19 severe enough to put them in a hospital face a long recovery. The virus ravages the heart, for example, in multiple ways. Direct invasion of heart cells can damage or destroy them. Massive inflammation can affect cardiac function. The virus can blunt the function of ACE2 receptors, which normally help protect heart cells and degrade angiotensin II, a hormone that increases blood pressure. Stress on the body from fighting the virus can prompt release of adrenaline and epinephrine, which can also “have a deleterious effect on the heart,” says Raul Mitrani, a cardiac electrophysiologist at the University of Miami who collaborates with Goldberger.</p>
<p>Mitrani and Goldberger, who co-authored a June paper in Heart Rhythm urging follow-up of patients who might have heart damage, worry in particular about the enzyme troponin, which is elevated in 20% to 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and signifies cardiac damage. (Troponin is sky-high during a heart attack, for example.) How the heart heals following COVID-19 might determine whether an irregular heartbeat develops or persists, Goldberger believes. “We have one guy in the hospital right now who had COVID 2 months ago and had all sorts of arrhythmia problems” then, Goldberger says. “He’s recovered from his COVID, but still has the arrhythmia.” For some patients with coronavirus-induced heart problems, treatments as simple as cholesterol-lowering drugs, aspirin, or beta blockers could help, Goldberger says.</p>
<p>Many people the pair has seen with heart complications post–COVID-19 had preexisting conditions, most commonly diabetes and hypertension. COVID-19, Goldberger suspects, tips them into more hazardous terrain or accelerates the onset of heart problems that, absent the coronavirus, might have developed later.</p>
<p>But other patients are affected without apparent risk factors: A paper this week in JAMA Cardiology found that 78 of 100 people diagnosed with COVID-19 had cardiac abnormalities when their heart was imaged on average 10 weeks later, most often inflammation in heart muscle. Many of the participants in that study were previously healthy, and some even caught the virus while on ski trips, according to the authors.</p>
<p>Severe lung scarring appears less common than feared—Gholamrezanezhad knows of only one recovered patient who still needs oxygen at rest. Scarring seems most likely to accompany underlying lung disease, hypertension, obesity, and other conditions. Lung damage is also seen in people who spend weeks on a ventilator. Gholamrezanezhad suspects that, as with harm to the heart, previously healthy people are not exempt from the virus’ long-term effects on the lungs, though their risk is likely lower.</p>
<p>Then there’s the nervous system, a worrying target. Severe complications seem relatively rare but aren’t limited to those whom the virus renders critically ill. Brown, Zandi, and colleagues described 43 people with neurologic complications this month in Brain; many had been hospitalized during their acute infection, but not always for long—and for some, neurologic problems were their most debilitating symptom and the reason for hospital admission. Several were struggling to recover from encephalitis. Others had inflammation in their brain’s white matter, which helps transmit electrical signals.</p>
<p>Separately, doctors are starting to see a class of patients who, like Akrami, struggle to think clearly—another outcome physicians have come upon in the past. After some severe viral infections, there are “those people who still don’t feel quite right afterward, but have normal brain scans,” Brown says. Some neurologists and patients describe the phenomenon as “brain fog.” It’s largely a mystery, though one theory suggests it’s similar to a “postviral fatigue related to inflammation in the body,” Brown says.</p>
<p>Could that be happening here? “Who knows, really?” Brown asks. “These patients need to be followed.”</p>
<p>People like these pose a growing concern (though they are also often dismissed by physicians). Collectively, these “long-haulers” describe dozens of symptoms, including many that could have multiple causes, such as fatigue, joint pain, and fever. “It’s time to give some voice to this huge population of patients,” Akrami says.</p>
<p>The most bedeviling and common lingering symptom seems to be fatigue, but researchers caution against calling it chronic fatigue syndrome. That’s “a specific diagnosis,” Marks says. “You might have fibrosis in the lungs, and that will make you feel fatigued; you might have impaired heart function, and that will make you feel fatigued.” Trying to trace symptoms to their source is critical to understanding and ultimately managing them, he says.</p>
<p>Iwasaki agrees. Doctors would treat symptoms differently depending on whether they result from a lingering infection or are rooted in autoimmune abnormalities. She has begun to recruit people who weren’t hospitalized when they had COVID-19 and will sift through her volunteers’ immune cells, examine whether they’re primed to attack, and measure whether the balance among different cell types is as it should be. She’ll also hunt for virus in saliva. “We’re pretty much searching for anything,” she says.</p>
<p>Even though it’s one virus, it can cause all different kinds of diseases in people. Akiko Iwasaki, Yale University</p>
<p>Iwasaki is especially struck by the number of young, healthy, active people—people like Akrami—who fall into the long-hauler category. As she and others struggle to find ways to help them, she wonders what might head off their symptoms. One possibility, she says, is monoclonal antibodies, which are now being tested as a treatment for acute infection and might also forestall lasting immune problems.</p>
<p>Hers is one of several survivor studies now underway. While Goldberger’s hometown of Miami faces a surge of acutely ill patients, he is looking ahead, applying for funding to image the heart and map its electrical activity in COVID-19 patients after they leave the hospital. Gholamrezanezhad is recruiting 100 patients after hospital discharge to follow for up to 2 years for lung assessments. Like many physicians, he fears the societal impact of even uncommon complications, including in the millions of people never hospitalized. “When you consider how many people are getting the disease, it’s a big problem,” he says.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic Ocean, Richter has recruited 300 volunteers in Germany for long-term follow-up, including lung scans. In the United Kingdom, patients will soon be able to sign up for that country’s survivor study, with many giving blood samples and being examined by specialists. The researchers will probe patients’ DNA and examine other characteristics such as age and health history to learn what might protect them from, or make them susceptible to, a range of COVID-19 induced health problems. Knowing who’s at risk of, say, kidney failure or cardiac arrhythmia could mean more targeted follow-up. The U.K. researchers are also keen to see whether patients who received certain treatments in the acute phase of illness, such as steroids or blood thinners, are less prone to later complications.</p>
<p>For her part, Akrami is one of 2 million people infected weeks or months ago participating in the COVID Symptom Study. The study welcomes anyone infected, and with 10% to 15% of people who use the app reporting ongoing symptoms, it has already yielded a welter of data, says Andrew Chan, an epidemiologist and physician at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>As he and his colleagues parse the data, they are identifying distinct “types” of acute illness, based on clusters of symptoms. Chan wonders whether certain early symptoms correlate with specific ones that linger. He acknowledges the risk that the app’s data could be skewed, because people who aren’t feeling well may be more likely to participate than those who have smooth recoveries. “We’re trying to develop data analysis tools” to account for that tilt, he says, “similar to methods used in polling. You have to weigh the biases.”</p>
<p>One of the few systematic, long-term studies of COVID-19 patients with mild acute symptoms is underway in San Francisco, where researchers are recruiting 300 adults from local doctors and hospitals, for 2 years of follow-up. “We don’t have a broad idea of what’s happening” after the initial illness, says Steven Deeks, an HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who is leading the study, modeled on HIV cohorts he has followed for decades. What does “ongoing symptoms” even mean, Deeks asks. “Is that weeks, months? We don’t know that it’s years.”</p>
<p>More than 100 people ranging in age from 18 to 80 have signed up so far. Cardiologists, neurologists, pulmonologists, and others are assessing the volunteers, and blood, saliva, and other biological specimens are being banked and analyzed.</p>
<p>Although scientists hope they’ll learn how to avert chronic symptoms and help patients currently suffering, this latest chapter in the COVID-19 chronicle has been sobering. The message many researchers want to impart: Don’t underestimate the force of this virus. “Even if the story comes out a little scary, we need a bit of that right now,” Iwasaki says, because the world needs to know how high the stakes are. “Once the disease is established, it’s really hard to go backward.”

<h3 id="heart-kidneys-brain-and-more-covid-19s-wide-ranging-effects">&ldquo;Heart, Kidneys, Brain, and More: COVID-19’s Wide-ranging Effects&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod.tctmd.com/public/2020-07/COVID19%20Multiorgan.jpg" alt="img">
A new review documents the extrapulmonary ramifications of COVID-19, including its heavy effect on the kidneys and heart.</p>
<p>Doctors battling COVID-19 in former hot spots are chronicling the many ways the disease goes beyond the lungs to affect the heart and brain, as well as the kidneys and endocrine system. The extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are incredibly varied, researchers say, with the heart and kidneys particularly vulnerable to damage.</p>
<p>Mahesh Madhavan, MD (NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York), co-lead author of the new report published July 10, 2020, in Nature Medicine, said that as a cardiologist, he was at first struck by the extent of thromboembolic complications associated with COVID-19. But as his hospital treated more and more infected patients, the far-ranging consequences of the disease became more apparent, he said.</p>
<p>“We all knew that the virus could cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia, but we had to really appreciate in detail the number of organ systems affected,” he told TCTMD. “As we were going through this, seeing the patients in front of us, it really was quite astounding to see the significant ramifications this virus had on these other systems.”</p>
<p>By day two or three in the intensive care unit, some of the patients would require dialysis. Aakriti Gupta</p>
<p>Aakriti Gupta, MD (NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center), another one of the report’s lead authors, said that when COVID-19 started to strike their hospital, they quickly became aware that the virus impacted more than the lungs.</p>
<p>“We’d have to keep changing the central and arterial lines again and again,” Gupta told TCTMD, referring to the increased incidence of thrombosis seen with the virus. “We would see they’d come in with renal failure and it would progress very rapidly. By day two or three in the intensive care unit, some of the patients would require dialysis. These were very sick patients, but I’d never seen that happen so consistently with every patient coming into the ICU. The implications of multi-organ involvement extend not only to their care during hospitalization, but also to follow-up of its long-term effects. COVID-19 care does not end at discharge for these patients.”</p>
<p>To TCTMD, Kartik Sehgal, MD (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), also a co-lead author, said there were a number of misconceptions about COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, with some suspecting this was “just the flu” or another one of the respiratory viruses seen every year.</p>
<p>More of TCTMD&rsquo;s coverage on our COVID-19 hub.</p>
<p>“It was certainly more than that,” he said. “It became quite clear from discussions with different colleagues and friends at the front lines that the virus not only affects the lungs and causes pneumonia in more severe cases, with some patients requiring intubation, but affects other organ systems, too. Even in the not-so-sick patients, we were seeing a lot of unusual manifestations. Kidney injury, cardiac injury, all at a higher rate than what we would have predicted from past experiences with other respiratory viruses.”</p>
<p>In their report, the researchers outline eight different organ-system related extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. These include neurologic, hepatic, gastrointestinal, thromboembolic, cardiac, endocrine, dermatologic, and renal consequences from infection. In terms of the cardiovascular manifestations, for example, myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and cardiogenic shock are some possible clinical presentations. Headache, dizziness, myalgias, and stroke are just some possible neurologic complications from COVID-19. In each setting, the group outlines the pathophysiology as well as considerations for patient management.</p>
<p>It really was quite astounding to see the significant ramifications this virus had on these other systems. Mahesh Madhavan</p>
<p>Sehgal said their intention was to highlight the virus’s disproportionate effect on other organs. “I think that’s important for physicians to be aware of what to look for when admitting a patient for COVID-19,” he said. Madhavan made a similar comment. “Being confronted with a problem on a scale none of us have ever encountered in our medical experiences thus far, it really drove us to describe what we were seeing in the hope it could be useful for hospital systems and healthcare workers in other locations now unfortunately facing the surges that we experienced a couple months ago,” he said.</p>
<p>Virus’ Broad Scope</p>
<p>In addition to the cardiac and thromboembolic manifestations, which have been documented in previous reports, Madhavan, Gupta, and Sehgal all cited acute kidney injury as a frequent complication of COVID-19, one that is associated with an increased risk of death. Gupta said that when they began treating patients with COVID-19 in March, they initially relied on data from China where the reported incidence of acute kidney injury ranged from 0.5% to 29%. As a result, they were initially blindsided by the much higher rate observed in New York City hospitals. A review of 13 academic and community hospitals in the city suggested the rate of acute kidney injury was 37%, with 14.3% of these patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Outside of acute kidney injury, patients may also present with electrolyte abnormalities, proteinuria, hematuria, and metabolic acidosis.</p>
<p>To TCTMD, Gupta said she was also struck by the endocrinologic manifestations of COVID-19. While patients with diabetes and obesity are at a higher risk of developing more-severe COVID-19 disease, some hospitalized patients without diabetes exhibited abnormal glucose metabolism, including hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.</p>
<p>It’s a relatively new virus and we’re still learning about it. Kartik Sehgal</p>
<p>In terms of why COVID-19 has such wide-ranging effects, Sehgal said there are several proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms. The coronavirus gains entry into target cells via the ACE2 receptor expressed in multiple organs, which may be damaged by direct viral infection. In addition, the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system, which is involved in fluid and electrolyte balance, blood-pressure regulation, vascular permeability, and tissue growth, may become dysfunctional as a result of the downregulation of ACE2 as a downstream effect of viral infection. Endothelial cell damage, which results in a cycle of clotting and inflammation, and hijacking of the immune response are other possible mechanisms for COVID-19’s multipronged attack on various organ systems, said Sehgal.</p>
<p>With respect to the long-term consequences, the researchers say it’s too early to tell. “It’s a relatively new virus and we’re still learning about it,” said Sehgal. There are anecdotal reports that ICU patients surviving their critical illness may have long-term lung/breathing issues, but that has yet to be confirmed. He said that if physicians intervene early, it may be possible to avert long-term damage to the heart and kidney, but more follow-up is needed.</p>
<p>“As these patients move into rehab facilities and ultimately back home, we’ll need to appreciate the long-term consequences of the virus,” said Madhavan. Since some patients required ICU-level care, he wouldn’t be surprised if there were long-term ramifications. “We’re all really concerned for the ones who need renal replacement therapy as they might have long-term consequences, likewise for the ones who had some thromboembolic event, such as DVT, as they’ll have to remain on anticoagulants. In addition, we have yet to totally understand whether patients will suffer from long-term neurologic sequalae and how patients are going to recover over the subsequent weeks to months after infection,” Madhavan observed.

<p>Patient data are a treasure trove for AI researchers. There&rsquo;s a problem though: many algorithms used to mine patient data act as black boxes, which makes their predictions often hard to interpret for doctors. Researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and the Zhejiang university in China have now developed an algorithm that not only predicts hospital readmissions of heart failure patients, but also tells you why these occur. The work has been published in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making.</p>
<p>Doctors are increasingly using data from electronic healthcare records to asses patient risks, predict outcomes, and recommend and evaluate treatments. Application of machine learning algorithms in clinical settings has however been hampered by lack of interpretability. The models often act as black boxes: you see what goes in (data) and what comes out (predictions), but you can&rsquo;t see what happens in between. It can therefore be very hard to interpret why the models are saying what they are saying.</p>
<p>This undermines the trust healthcare professionals have in machine learning algorithms, and limits their use in everyday clinical decisions. Of course, interpretability is also a key requirement of EU privacy regulations (GDPR), so improving it also has legal benefits.</p>
<p>Attention-based neural networks</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Ph.D. candidate Peipei Chen of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences, together with other researchers at TU/e and Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, has tested an attention-based neural network on heart patients in China. Attention-based networks are able to focus on key details in data using contextual information.</p>
<p>In this figure we see the relative risk weights (y-axis) of 105 characteristics (x-axis) for two random patients. For patient a) features NT-proBNP (21), Sodium (32) and Coronary Heart Disease (12) are the most important risk factors, for patient b) NT-proBNP (21), Systolic blood pressure (7) and Left ventricular end-systolic volume (87). Credit: Eindhoven University of Technology</p>
<p>This is the same approach humans take to evaluate the world around them. When people look at a picture of a Dalmatian, they immediately focus on the four-legged black-spotted white shape in the center of the image and recognize it&rsquo;s a dog. To do this, they apply both intuition and information gleaned from the context. Attention-based neural networks essentially do the same.</p>
<p>Because of their sensitivity to context, these neural networks are not only good at making predictions, they also allow you to exactly see what feature was responsible for what result. Of course, this considerably increases the interpretability of your predictions. Attention-based networks are traditionally used in image recognition and speech recognition, where context is key in understanding what&rsquo;s going on. Recently, they have also been applied in other domains.</p>
<p>Experiment</p>
<p>Peipei Chen and her colleagues followed 736 heart failure patients from a Chinese hospital. Based on patient characteristics, they tried to predict and interpret readmissions of the patients within 12 months after their release from hospital. The researchers looked at 105 features, including age and gender, blood pressure and heart rate, diseases such as diabetes and kidney problems, length of stay and medicine use.</p>
<p>The attention-based model predicted two-thirds of all readmissions, slightly improving on three other popular prediction models. More importantly, the model was able to specify what risk factors were contributing most to chance of readmission for each patient (see image), making the predictions much more useful for doctors. Moreover, the model provided the most important risk factors for all patient samples. Doing so, the researchers identified three echocardiographic measurements that were not identified by another model.</p>
<p>Before the attention-based model can be implemented by doctors, it needs to be validated on larger data sets. Chen also wants to expand on the research by including textdata gained from discharge and daily progress notes in the electronic health records.</p>

<h3 id="kidney-disease-progresses-faster-after-cardiovascular-hospitalization">&ldquo;Kidney Disease Progresses Faster After Cardiovascular Hospitalization&rdquo;</h3>

Hospitalization for de novo heart failure or coronary heart disease (CHD) leads to an accelerated decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a new study found.</p>
<p>For patients with a first-time heart failure hospitalization, the rate of eGFR decline increased significantly from ‐1.67 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year before the event to ‐2.76 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year after the event (a ‐1.09 mL/min/1.73 m2 difference). For patients hospitalized with CHD, eGFR decline increased significantly from ‐1.09 to ‐1.87 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (a slope increase of ‐0.78 mL/min/1.73 m2). No acceleration in eGFR decline was observed among patients hospitalized with incident stroke, perhaps due to the relatively small sample size.</p>
<p>The accelerated declines in eGFR after heart failure and CHD were consistent across the spectrum of eGFR, Junichi Ishigami, MD, MPH, of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, and colleagues reported in the European Journal of Heart Failure. The rate of kidney function decline prior to hospitalization was steeper among patients with more advanced kidney disease. For example, patients with eGFRs of 60 or more, 30 to 59, and less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the 2 years prior to heart failure hospitalization had a baseline eGFR decline of ‐0.64, ‐1.43, and ‐2.42 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.</p>
<p>For the study, the investigators analyzed data from 20,420 patients hospitalized for the first time with heart failure, 18,152 with CHD, and 1808 with stroke from the Stockholm CREAtinine Measurements (SCREAM) Project in Sweden. The study excluded patients with end-stage kidney disease.</p>

<p>“From a clinical perspective, the incidence of CVD [cardiovascular disease] should be recognized as an event to accelerate kidney function decline regardless of the baseline kidney function. … Thus, physicians may need to be cautious about the use of potentially nephrotoxic drugs for these patients, especially when their clinical benefits are controversial (e.g., proton pump inhibitor),” Dr Ishigami’s team stated.</p>
<p>They added that their study “suggests the need for a long-term follow-up of kidney function evaluation after an episode of CVD, extending the notion on the prognostic importance of worsening kidney function during the acute CVD phase.”</p>
<p>The present study involved patients with symptoms serious enough to warrant hospitalization, so future studies should explore whether eGFR trajectory differs between inpatients and outpatients with worsening heart failure and CHD and whether avoiding hospitalization slows kidney disease progression, according to the investigators.</p>
