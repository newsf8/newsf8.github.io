						 <p>Bony lesions on the lower part of the thigh bone near the knee are a common but benign finding on MRI in young alpine skiers and should not be confused with more serious conditions, according to a study from Switzerland published in the journal Radiology.</p>
<p>Routine knee MRI of adolescents often reveals tumor-like irregularities in the bone of the distal femur, the part of the thigh bone right above the knee. These irregularities affect the cortical bone, the dense outer surface of the bone. For that reason, they are referred to as distal femoral cortical irregularities (DFCI). DFCI often lead to diagnostic uncertainty because they can be confused with more serious conditions like cancer or infection.</p>
<p>With an increasing number of MRI examinations performed in young patients, DFCI detection is likely to increase, as MRI has a higher sensitivity for detecting lesions than X-rays do, according to study lead author Christoph Stern, M.D., a musculoskeletal radiologist at Balgrist University Hospital in Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal was to better understand the pathogenesis of DFCI and to reduce uncertainty in the diagnosis of this benign condition, which should not be mistaken for malignancy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In the first study of its kind, Dr. Stern and colleagues investigated the prevalence of DFCI in youth competitive alpine skiers compared to a control group of young adults. Competitive skiers are exposed to periodical high physical activity and loading patterns to the knee joint that are likely to affect the bones and connective tissue of the joint.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the knee MRIs of 105 youth competitive alpine skiers with those of 105 controls of the same age group collected from 2014 to 2019. They looked for the presence of DFCI at two tendon-bone attachment areas: the ones between the gastrocnemius &ndash; the major muscle of the calf &ndash; and the femur, and the ones between the adductor magnus muscle of the inner thigh and the femur.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>A DFCI was found in more than half of the youth competitive alpine skiers (58.1%), compared with slightly more than a quarter of the controls (26.7%).</p>
<p>DFCIs were observed at the attachment sites of tendons, predominantly at the inside head of the gastrocnemius muscle for both skiers and controls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DFCI are benign lesions, and occurrence around the knee joint is associated with repetitive mechanical stress to the attachment sites of tendons into bone,&rdquo; Dr. Stern said. &ldquo;DFCI should not be mistaken for malignancy and are not associated with intraarticular damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most common theory behind the DFCI occurrence is that of a &ldquo;tug lesion&rdquo; as a result of repetitive mechanical stress where the tendons attach to the bone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to histologic results of DFCI, which have identified a reactive process, we assume there must be increased bone remodeling with resorption and fibrous proliferation at the site of the tendon attachment that is pronounced in young competitive athletes,&rdquo; Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p>Similar findings are likely to be found in other groups of athletes who place repetitive strain of the gastrocnemius muscles, such as those whose sports involve jumping, Dr. Stern said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This would apply to basketball and volleyball players,&rdquo; Dr. Stern said. &ldquo;It might also apply for weightlifters who are exposed to similar pretension states and eccentric loading of the gastrocnemius muscles as skiers during exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers recommend that invasive diagnostic procedures such as biopsies be avoided in these patients due to the benign, usually asymptomatic, and over time self-limiting character of typical DFCIs at the attachment sites of tendons. However, follow-up with MRI might be justified, they said, especially in the rare case where the DFCI causes pain and other symptoms.

<h3 id="osp-retrieves-human-like-bone">&ldquo;OSP retrieves human-like bone&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://lincolncityhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OSP-Troopers-at-Worldmark.jpg" alt="img">
YACHATS — Beachcombers who reported a “possible human bone” at 4:30 p.m. Thursday, June 11, were soon met at the scene by Oregon State Trooper Scott Severson.</p>
<p>Jenny Finau and Greg Petry discovered the grisly item due west of Mile Post 164. The trooper concurred the bone looked hominid enough to recover, recounting, “I collected the item and it was logged at the Newport Patrol Office for further evaluation.”</p>
<p>Troopers are taught to identify the characteristics of human bones in academy courses on evidence and crime scenes: the flatter rib cage, curved spine and dish-shaped pelvis and separate calf bones are typical to humans, for example.</p>
<p>Many people snatched by sneaker waves in Lincoln County, such as Kelly Bennett Smith who disappeared while taking pictures at Rocky Creek State Park in 2016, are not recovered. In 2018 a man was swept to sea off the rocks in Depoe Bay, as were a mother and father in the same area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Oregon State Police maintain an active file of over 1,100 missing people in Oregon on their website.

WITH round three fast approaching, our reporters have been doing their homework to find out the health of your club&rsquo;s list.</p>
<p>Who is touch and go and who will be watching from the sidelines? We find out when your wounded stars will get back on the park.</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Jake Kelly Concussion Test Riley Knight Achilles 2-3 weeks Rory Sloane Thigh Test Tyson Stengle Suspension 3 games Patrick Wilson Shoulder TBC Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Sloane faces an uphill battle to be back for this week&rsquo;s clash with Gold Coast after suffering a badly corked thigh against the Power. He attempted to play on but was severely limited and will need to pass a test later this week. Kelly will go through the concussion protocols after receiving a knock last week in the loss to Port Adelaide. - Callum Twomey</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Marcus Adams Foot 2-3 weeks Dayne Zorko Achilles soreness Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Zorko will need to prove his fitness later in the week after pulling up sore following Saturday&rsquo;s win against Fremantle. He had been nursing Achilles soreness in the lead-up to the game and will again be managed during the week. The club admits Adams remains in a holding pattern after foot surgery during the shutdown period. - Mitch Cleary</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Charlie Curnow Knee Season Tom De Koning Ankle Test Paddy Dow Knee 2-3 weeks Zac Fisher Ankle 1 week Brodie Kemp Knee Season Matthew Kreuzer Foot 8-10 weeks Caleb Marchbank Knee 2-4 weeks Nic Newman Knee Season Jack Silvagni Illness Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>The Blues should regain Silvagni, who missed last week&rsquo;s defeat to the Demons due to a bout of gastro. However, Dow and Fisher won&rsquo;t return having failed to play in Saturday morning&rsquo;s scratch match. Newman will miss the season after rupturing his patella, while Marchbank is likely another month or so away with bone bruising. De Koning is available for selection this week, while fellow ruckman Kreuzer is still angling for a return late in the season. - Riley Beveridge</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Dayne Beams Mental health Indefinite Mason Cox Knee Test Levi Greenwood Knee 2-4 weeks Tom Langdon Knee Indefinite Ben Reid Calf 2-4 weeks Adam Treloar Calf Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>The Pies are confident Cox should be available, having been named as an emergency last week despite a nagging knee injury. Treloar is the big question mark, though he might be another week away having barely been tested by full-contact sessions. They escaped Thursday night&rsquo;s draw against the Tigers with a clean bill of health. - Riley Beveridge</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Joe Daniher Groin Indefinite Sam Draper Knee Test Orazio Fantasia Quad Test Noah Gown Foot Test Tom Hird Foot Season Lachie Johnson Knee 10-12 weeks Kobe Mutch Concussion Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>The watch this week will be on Fantasia&rsquo;s fitness. Since injuring his quad a couple of weeks ago the small forward has made good progress and will be touch-and-go to face Melbourne this Sunday. Daniher is joining in more drills as he gets closer to full fitness, but a return date is still unclear for the key forward. - Callum Twomey</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Blake Acres Calf 1 week Sean Darcy Knee TBA Stefan Giro Knee 1 week Joel Hamling Ankle TBA Liam Henry Knee 3 weeks Alex Pearce Ankle TBA Sam Switkowski Back TBA Nathan Wilson Back Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>The Dockers&rsquo; biggest concern from the weekend was the knee injury to No.1 ruckman Darcy. Scans have cleared him of any ACL or PCL concerns, but he has some soft tissue damage which will require treatment. Acres took a calf cork into last Thursday&rsquo;s training session and he suffered a small strain which will keep him out against the Power. Wilson was a late withdrawal against the Lions after twinging his back on the flight to the Gold Coast, but he is a chance to return on Sunday. - Chris Correia</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Nakia Cockatoo Hamstring Indefinite Josh Jenkins Back Test Jake Kolodjashnij Hip Test Stefan Okunbor Achilles Indefinite Gary Rohan Knee Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Jack Steven has been cleared to play, with a decision to come at the selection table as to whether he faces the Blues. Kolodjashnij wasn&rsquo;t risked last week and will come into consideration this week. Rohan twisted his knee against the Hawks but should be fine to play, while Jenkins will be out to prove he&rsquo;s over a back complaint. - Mitch Cleary</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Sam Day Back Available Brandon Ellis Calf Test George Horlin-Smith Foot TBC Anthony Miles Hamstring 2-3 weeks Izak Rankine Hamstring Test Mitch Riordan ACL Season Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>The Suns will get co-captain David Swallow back from suspension, while Ellis will also rejoin full training in a bid to get back from his calf strain. The club is taking a slow approach with Rankine, while key tall Day is fine to play despite a heavy knee to the back last week against West Coast. - Callum Twomey</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Matt Flynn Knee 3-4 weeks Tom Hutchesson Hamstring Test Adam Kennedy Hamstring Test Tim Taranto Shoulder 4 weeks Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>The club is being cautious with Kennedy&rsquo;s hamstring and he was unavailable last week against the Kangaroos. After Callan Ward and Zac Williams returned from injury last week the Giants have a very fit list, with Taranto another month off being available from his shoulder surgery. - Callum Twomey</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Will Golds Knee Season Dan Howe Foot Indefinite Jarman Impey Knee 3-5 weeks Changkuoth Jiath Hamstring 1 week Jaeger O&rsquo;Meara Facial fracture Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Doctors cleared O&rsquo;Meara for contact training on Tuesday and the gun midfielder is set to return for Thursday night&rsquo;s clash with reigning premier Richmond in a timely boost. That&rsquo;s after Blake Hardwick (ruptured pectoral muscle) made his return in last week&rsquo;s loss to Geelong. The player everyone is watching for is Impey, who is still projected for a July return. Tom Mitchell is dealing with a sore right shoulder but isn&rsquo;t expected to miss any games. - Marc McGowan</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Marty Hore Toe 5-7 weeks Kade Kolodjashnij Concussion Indefinite Harry Petty Hip/groin Indefinite Braydon Preuss Achilles 3-4 weeks Aaron Nietschke Knee Season Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>The Demons have a pretty healthy list, with none of their first-choice players on the sidelines, and they escaped unscathed from Saturday&rsquo;s narrow win over Carlton. Preuss&rsquo; frustrating second season at Melbourne includes knee and now Achilles setbacks, but he’s at least running again, while Kolodjashnij and Petty have dealt with their issues since the pre-season. Hore has spent time away from the club, but will return next week to start rehabilitating his fractured toe. Harley Bennell (calf) and Aaron vandenBerg (foot) pulled up well from their senior and practice matches, respectively. - Marc McGowan</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Charlie Comben Back/Knee TBC Luke Davies-Uniacke Groin TBC Majak Daw Chest 2 weeks Taylor Garner Hamstring 5 weeks Ben Jacobs Head/neck TBC Nick Larkey Foot 3-4 weeks Flynn Perez Knee TBC Kayne Turner Sesamoid/foot 3-4 weeks Dom Tyson Calf 1 week Ed Vickers-Willis Turf toe 3-4 weeks Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>North is being cautious with Larkey&rsquo;s foot issue and he will be held back for another few weeks until he is reporting no pain. Tyson&rsquo;s shocking luck with calf injuries has continued after he was restricted to only three games last year. His history means the Roos are likely to be cautious with his recovery but it appears to be only minor. Lockdown defender Marley Williams is available after missing the first two rounds through suspension for his high bump on Dog Ed Richards. - Marc McGowan</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Trent Burgoyne Leg 2-3 weeks Ryan Burton Knee Test Tobin Cox Quad 1-2 weeks Willem Drew Foot 5-7 weeks Mitch Georgiades Calf Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>There is concern around Burton&rsquo;s availability, after the youngster failed to finish Saturday night&rsquo;s Showdown due to a sprained knee. He&rsquo;ll undergo a fitness test later this week. However, in better news, young forward Georgiades should return from a minor calf injury. - Riley Beveridge</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Josh Caddy Calf Test Noah Cumberland ACL Season Updated: Monday, June 15</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Caddy missed round two with a minor calf complaint, but will be in contention to return for Thursday night&rsquo;s clash against Hawthorn if gets through training. Draftee Cumberland will miss the entire season after rupturing his ACL at training in May. - Ben Sutton</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Oscar Clavarino Hamstring 1-2 weeks Jarryn Geary Hamstring 1-2 weeks Darragh Joyce Hamstring Test Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Scans on Monday confirmed Geary has sustained a hamstring strain that will sideline him for at least this week against Collingwood. Joyce and Clavarino have returned to running, but will need to impress on the track to earn selection. - Mitch Cleary</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Joel Amartey Hamstring 2 weeks Lance Franklin Hamstring TBC Michael Knoll Knee 5-7 weeks Sam Naismith Hamstring Test Sam Reid Calf 3-4 weeks Jackson Thurlow Calf 1 week Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Coach John Longmire ruled out No.1 ruckman Naismith post-match on Sunday and he remains unlikely to face North Melbourne but football boss Charlie Gardiner left the door ajar. That means Callum Sinclair will again shoulder the ruck duties. There were no fresh concerns from the weekend. Ben Ronke (knee) played about 80 minutes in a practice game at the weekend and is available for selection. Thurlow is nearing a return but neither Franklin nor Reid is expected to play soon. Reid has resumed running on the AlterG anti-gravity treadmill but is still a few weeks away from playing. - Marc McGowan</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Jarrod Cameron Pubic bone Test Mark Hutchings Knee 1-2 weeks Jeremy McGovern Suspension 1 game Mitch O&rsquo;Neill Back Indefinite Luke Shuey Soreness Test Daniel Venables Concussion Season Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Shuey did little at training on Monday after a bruising loss to the Suns left him with ice on his right thigh late in the match. Hutchings is edging towards a return to full training, while Cameron will continue to build fitness after an interrupted couple of months. O&rsquo;Neill has remained at home with family while his teammates are settled on the Gold Coast. - Mitch Cleary</p>
<p>PLAYER INJURY ESTIMATED RETURN Ben Cavarra Hand 2-3 weeks Taylor Duryea Quad 3-4 weeks Riley Garcia Knee Indefinite Lachie Hunter Club suspension 3 games Roarke Smith Quad Test Easton Wood Quad 3-4 weeks Updated: Tuesday, June 16</p>
<p>Early prognosis</p>
<p>Wood and Duryea are both set to miss 3-4 weeks with quad strains, while Smith is back in full training after battling quad tightness. Cavarra was listed as an emergency for round two but was pulled out after getting his hand stood on during Saturday&rsquo;s captain&rsquo;s run. He&rsquo;s set to miss 2-3 weeks following surgery. - Jourdan Canil</p>
<p>*Placed on the club&rsquo;s long-term injury list

<h3 id="a-leg-injury-that-will-not-heal">&ldquo;A leg injury that will not heal&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.namibian.com.na/public/uploads/images/5ec52331ca7c9/Health1.jpg" alt="img">
THE first time The Namibian met Yevari Angula, he was refusing to move from outside the shop he sells his sausages and sweets in the Havana informal settlement in Windhoek.</p>
<p>The management of the shopping centre from where he sells his wares deem him an illegal trader and wanted him off the property.</p>
<p>So when this newspaper approached him, Angula was reluctant to speak about his ordeal.</p>
<p>Angula (24), who walks with difficulty because of an injured leg, finally asked if The Namibian had also come to chase him away. However, The Namibian was curious about his limp and deformed leg. He was relieved to know that the interview was about his leg instead.</p>
<p>“Okay . . . because I am not planning to leave this place until I sell everything and reach my target for the day. They [management] can see I am disabled, where do they want me to sell?” Angula said.</p>
<p>Angula was born and grew up in the Endola constituency in Ohangwena region. He never attended school.</p>
<p>Asked what happened to his leg, he explained that he was not born with a disability.</p>
<p>He answered the question while keeping an eye on the manager of the shop from where he sells his wares.</p>
<p>“I was not born this way, I broke my leg when I was 10 years old, we were herding cattle in the field when an older boy threw a tree stump to stop a cow from straying but instead it hit me on the left lower part of the leg and it broke. I still remember that pain because I have had to live with it till now,” explained Angula.</p>
<p>He added that when they returned home, his leg was wrapped with a piece of cloth. He was given traditional medicine for the pain as the hospital was too far.</p>
<p>“I was in so much pain I could not move for months, I still can&rsquo;t believe I made it and still wonder how I pulled through with the pain. Until now, I experience the pain, especially when it rains, but I have learned to live with it,” Angula said, while sipping an energy drink.</p>
<p>According to Donald Matukane, a orthopeadic surgeon at Ongwediva Medipark, a broken leg happens when one of the bones in the leg cracks. It is also referred to as a leg fracture.</p>
<p>He, however, said he did not examine Angula but The Namibian narrated his ordeal to Matukane, and sent him pictures.</p>
<p>“He has a severe flexion of the knee bending and tibial deformity (shin bone). He will need to be examined to see if it is possible to correct the deformity, X-rays of the lower limb, angiogram to check the blood supply,” he said, adding that the blood supply monitoring should be done before any intervention.</p>
<p>He further added that at the time of injury, an X-ray should have been done to asses the severity of the injury, and the type of treatment could be decided upon surgical intervention or non-surgical operation.</p>
<p>The anatomy of the leg bones</p>
<p>According to a health site called Healthline, there are three types of bones in the leg. These are the fibula, which is the smaller of the two bones below the knee. It is also called the calf bone. The tibia is the larger of the two bones below the knee. The femur is the bone above the knee. It is also called the thigh bone or the shin bone.</p>
<p>“The fibula helps to stabilise and support your leg, body, ankle, and leg muscles. It runs parallel to the tibia, a larger bone that also forms the shin, and attaches the ankle and knee joint.</p>
<p>The fibula only carries 17% of the body&rsquo;s weight. A fibula fracture happens when more pressure is put on the bone than it can handle. Angula, however told The Namibian that after his bone broke, he could not walk so he would use a stick to maintain balance.</p>
<p>“The leg was swollen and at times it bled, it was not easy, it was painful. I really don&rsquo;t know how to explain that pain,” he said, adding that it only got better when he was about 14.</p>
<p>Angula disclosed that he only got medical attention for the leg when he was 12, but was told it was too late to restore it so since then, he has only been receiving pain killers whenever he goes to the hospital.</p>
<p>Healthline says the general process for healing a fibula fracture is immobilisation with a splint or cast of plaster for several weeks, after which the patient might get a walking boot to help with mobility.</p>
<p>“Recovery time depends on factors such as the severity of the injury and the presence of any other injury; your age; and how well you can follow your doctor&rsquo;s orders; whether or not you require surgery; the amount of time spent on physical therapy; and any other underlying conditions that may affect the healing,” says Healthline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr Matukane said that surgery carries a high risk of blood vessel and nerve injury because the structures cannot be stretched too quickly and too much..</p>
<p>“If correction and lengthening is to be done, highly specialised equipment is used, but it must be made clear to the patient the risk the procedure carries. One of the complications may include leg amputations,” Matukane explains.

<h3 id="animal-feed-protein-ingredients---market-size-growth-forecast-2020-to-2025">&ldquo;Animal Feed Protein Ingredients - Market Size, Growth Forecast 2020 to 2025&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cuereport.com/assets/imgs/news-5.jpg" alt="img">
A detailed overview of Animal Feed Protein Ingredients market with respect to the pivotal drivers influencing the revenue graph of this business sphere. The current trends of Animal Feed Protein Ingredients market in conjunction with the geographical landscape, demand spectrum, remuneration scale, and growth graph of this vertical have also been included in this report.</p>
<p>With respect to product, the market is segmented into oilseed meals, fishmeal, and animal by-products. Oilseed meals segment is further divided into soymeal, copra palm meal, sunflower meal, canola/rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and others.</p>
<p>Animal feed protein ingredients market is earmarked to experience a substantial growth spurt over the forthcoming timeframe. With rising production of livestock, poultry and dairy across the globe, the demand for animal feed is also increasing.</p>

<p>Among these, the sunflower meal held a share of over 5.0% in 2019 owing to rising inclination towards plant-based protein ingredients. Sunflower meal is an excellent livestock feed, specifically for ruminants. Sunflower meals could be extracted from decorticated or whole seeds and could be mechanically or/and solvent extracted.</p>
<p>Feathers are rich in protein content, namely keratin, producing a considerable mass that could be converted to valuable meal. In order to make feather meal digestible it must first be converted through a hydrolysis process.</p>
<p>Copra palm meal will witness a CAGR of over 3.5% through the projected duration. It is basically produced as a byproduct when coconut oil is removed by solvent extraction from the meat of the coconut. Copra meal largely indicates the largest quantity of locally available feed proteins in many tropical areas, which includes Central America, some countries in South East Asia, and few African countries.</p>
<p>Advancements in existing processing methods which hydrolyse proteins present in feathers to make them easily digestible for non-ruminant animals have further led to the accessibility of hydrolysed feather meal, providing a suitable, economic livestock feed.</p>
<p>Moving ahead, the blood meal segment is set to witness a CAGR of over 3.0% over the coming years. Blood meals comprises mostly of proteins and can be used to supplement diets based on plant by-products, forages and cereal grains.</p>
<p>Based on livestock, the market is segmented into poultry, swine, cattle, aquaculture, pet food, equine, and others. The poultry based livestock is subclassified into layer, broiler, turkey, and others. Among these, layer had a share of over 13% in 2019. The turkey based livestock, meanwhile, will witness a CAGR of over 3.0% due to high protein level.</p>
<p>Swine based livestock is classified into starter, sow, and grower. Among these, the grower segment will witness over 5% CAGR in coming years. Cattle based livestock is divided into dairy, calf, and other. The calf-based livestock segment held a share of over 9.5% in 2019 owing to rising milk demand.</p>
<p>Aquaculture is likely to exhibit a CAGR of around 5% CAGR owing to rising fish consumption globally. Pet food registered a market share of over 2.5% in 2019 due to increasing pet adoption trends.</p>
<p>Equine will witness a CAGR of over 3.5%. These are generally non-ruminant herbivores. Good sources of protein that could be added to the diet include soybean meal and alfalfa. The other livestock-based animal feed protein registered a market share of over 2.5% in 2019.</p>
<p>From a geographical frame of reference, North America animal feed protein ingredients market is set to witness a CAGR of over 3% owing to rising consumption of non-vegetarian food products. The Middle East &amp; Africa market will also witness a CAGR of over 3.5% during the projected timeframe.</p>

<p>Jahrome Hughes will miss up to three weeks with a broken hand. Picture: AAP</p>
<p>The Storm will be without Jahrome Hughes for 2-3 weeks after he suffered a broken hand in the victory over the Rabbitohs on Friday night.</p>
<p>The halfback was able to finish the game after rolling out of a tackle clutching at his hand in the 1st half, but scans on Saturday unfortunately revealed a fracture.</p>
<p>He will undergo surgery to insert pins/plates, which actually can speed up a return to play. Bone healing usually requires at least 4-6 weeks to occur conservatively, but the use of surgery helps to stabilise the fracture and allow for early range of movement and accelerated rehab.</p>
<p>This can also minimise the risk of complications such as stiffness and muscle wastage, and return to play in some athletes has been achieved within 10 days of surgery.</p>

<p>Victor Radley will be on a &ldquo;booze ban&rdquo; this weekend after suffering an elbow injury in the Roosters big win over the Broncos.</p>
<p>Radley&rsquo;s arm was caught awkwardly during a tackle causing both his shoulder and elbow to bend to abnormal angles. This can bring concern for an elbow subluxation or ligament sprain, but thankfully the indication since has been that the lock forward avoided major injury.</p>
<p>Roosters captain Boyd Cordner suggested it was nothing more than a &ldquo;bruised elbow&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although Radley appears to have avoided the worst case, he is right to suggest it is in an injured athlete&rsquo;s best interest to avoid drinking alcohol. Alcohol is known to increase the risk of bleeding and swelling in soft tissue injuries while overall slowing down the healing process.</p>
<p>This increases the recovery time and results in additional time on the sideline.</p>
<p>The Cowboys suffered a big loss this week with Jason Taumalolo not named for Round 4 after scans revealed bone bruising in his knee.</p>
<p>This was quite a surprise after the star lock forward was able to play a significant role for the Cowboys in Round 3, racking up almost 300 run metres and not appearing to limp at all throughout the game.</p>
<p>Bone bruising can sound quite minor, but this isn&rsquo;t always the case.</p>
<p>There are two common locations bone bruising occurs in the knee:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deep (knee joint), usually caused by hyperextension of knee (bones pinch together)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shallow (outer surface of bone), usually caused by collision/knee clash (&ldquo;bone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>cork&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The Cowboys badly need to see the return of Jason Taumalolo. Picture: Alix Sweeney</p>
<p>Deep bruising usually requires longer to recover due to increased pain (weight bearing surfaces of the knee) and the risk of complications and articular cartilage loss if a return occurs too soon. Shallow bone bruises (contusions) are more common in contact sports and rarely see players miss more than 1-2 weeks.</p>
<p>There were further blows to the Cowboys forward stocks with Coen Hess (ankle, pre-game) and John Asiata (knee) both coming out of Round 4 with injuries to manage.</p>
<p>Hess was ruled out an hour before the game, with all indications from the Cowboys that the ankle injury is minor and he is expected to return next week.</p>
<p>The news may not be so good for Asiata, who went down just before half time in significant pain during an awkward tackle. The Sharks around him motioned for the referee to stop the game straight away, and while the Cowboys&rsquo; interchange forward tried to play on he succumbed to the injury minutes later.</p>
<p>Sharks players call for assistance as John Asiata lays injured on the turf. Picture: AAP</p>
<p>Post-game there was still no indication on the nature or severity of the injury; the mechanism along with placement of the ice on the lateral side of Asiata&rsquo;s knee suggested the main concern was for a compression/impact type injury. This can range from a minor bone bruise to a lateral meniscus injury or even a tibial plateau fracture.</p>
<p>The Cowboys will be hoping scan results come back with positive news.</p>
<p>Unfortunate news for the Raiders and John Bateman this week with news the star forward was to undergo a second round of shoulder surgery.</p>
<p>After reportedly struggling with rehab progress during isolation, Bateman initially had an injection into his shoulder a few weeks ago to try and settle the lingering pain and inflammation.</p>
<p>This was obviously unsuccessful and the most appropriate treatment option was further surgery to help Bateman gain full function of his shoulder.</p>
<p>Operation done and dusted. Let’s get stuck in to this rehab and get back out there ⏳ pic.twitter.com/Ng1gYkKyAs — John Bateman (@johnbateman1) June 5, 2020</p>
<p>While there has been no surgical details or recovery time provided by the Raiders at this stage, they have indicated the surgery was a success and Bateman will return this season.</p>
<p>In these cases an arthroscopic &ldquo;clean-out&rdquo; of the shoulder joint is common, with tendon releases (such as the biceps) sometimes performed if significant inflammation is discovered during arthroscopic examination.</p>
<p>If Bateman did require some combination of these procedures he definitely should be expected to return this season; usual recovery time is 4-10 weeks.</p>
<p>Josh Addo-Carr struggled with what appeared to be a rib cartilage injury for much of the Storm&rsquo;s clash with the Rabbitohs.</p>
<p>Known as &ldquo;The Police&rdquo; injury, as it hurts with every breath you take and every move you make, Addo-Carr will likely require painkilling injections and chest padding over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Thankfully the Storm indicated he will be fine for Round 5.</p>
<p>Josh Addo-Carr is dealing with a painful rib cartilage injury. Picture: AAP</p>
<p>The Sea Eagles came out of their loss to the Eels with a few minor injury concerns, with Addin Fonua-Blake (shoulder cork) and Curtis Sironen (knee) both finishing the game in pain. Coach Des Hasler seemed unconcerned post-match and expected both to be available moving forward.</p>
<p>Alex Glenn is aiming to return in Round 6 as he recovers from a deep laceration to his calf. This would be a 3 week return to play after he required surgery to clean out the wound to minimise risk of infection.</p>
<p>Another surprise injury was revealed during the week with the Broncos to be without hooker Jake Turpin for the next 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>Turpin missed training early in the week with what was initially reported as &ldquo;knee soreness&rdquo;, with scans unfortunately revealing a small fracture in his tibia (lower leg bone). Thankfully he has avoided the need for surgery with such a small fracture, with the 4-6 weeks required to allow for adequate bone healing to occur.</p>
<p>Chad Townsend (hamstring) and Andrew Fifita (calf) both missed Round 4 with soft tissue injuries. There had been previous reports of ongoing management of a knee injury and a calf injury for Fifita. Both players are hoping to be available in Round 5 for the Sharks.</p>
<p>Lachlan Burr did not pass progression from HIA protocols earlier in the week and was unavailable for the Warriors. Agnatius Paasi was also unavailable after a concussion against the Dragons.</p>
<p>While each concussion is different and recovery differs from person to person the Warriors are hopeful they will have both players available to face the Cowboys in Round 5.</p>
<p>The Warriors training injuries kept coming, with Jazz Tevaga (soft tissue injury) and Ken Maumalo (hamstring) both suffering setbacks this week. Maumalo is expected to miss at least 3 weeks, while Tevaga is awaiting scans to determine the severity and expected recovery time of his injury.</p>
