Already over $2.7bn has been paid out to New Zealand businesses and their employees under the government’s wage subsidy scheme. We take a look at how it works and how to know if you’re eligible.</p>
<p>This article has been updated to reflect changes to the wage subsidy scheme announced on March 27.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 wage subsidy is designed to support employers and help them continue to pay their workers over the four-week shutdown period and beyond.</p>
<p>However, because wages and working times vary markedly across businesses, some employees may be confused about how the wage subsidy works and how much of it they are entitled to.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>It works how it sounds – it’s government money that subsidises your wage so your employer can keep their business operating through the hard times.</p>
<p>An affected business (or self employed contractor) that can show or project a 30% decline in revenue compared with the same month last year can apply for the wage subsidy, which the government pays out at $585.80 per week per full time employee (working 20 hours or more a week) and $350 per week per part time employee (working less than 20 hours a week).</p>
<p>Among other criteria, Work and Income stated that the business “must make best efforts to retain employees and pay them a minimum of 80% of their normal income for the subsidised period” in order to qualify.</p>
<p>What if I usually make more than $585.80 per week?</p>
<p>If you are a full time employee and usually earn more than $585.80 per week, then your employer should pay the additional amount to meet 80% of your regular weekly wage.</p>
<p>For example, if you work for an affected business and you normally earn $1000 per week before tax, then your employer should be paying you 80% of $1000, after deducting Kiwisaver and taxes. The $585.80 wage subsidy is to help your employer pay that amount.</p>
<p>Some employers that are struggling to make up the 80% minimum payment even with the wage subsidy applied are using an employee’s accrued annual leave to pay the difference. More on the rules around that here.</p>
<p>However, if the businesses has no activity because employees are not working any hours, the employer must pass on at least the whole value of the wage subsidy to each affected worker if they’re unable to match 80% of the worker’s pre-COVID income.</p>
<p>Employers can elect to pay more than the 80% amount if they choose. The owner of an Auckland mechanics for example has elected to pay his employees their full wage for the four-week shut-down period, but may have to reduce that to 80% if the shut-down period continues for longer.</p>
<p>What if I earn less than the $585 wage subsidy?</p>
<p>If you are a full time employee and you earn less than $585.80 gross per week, the 80% minimum payment does not apply, and you should be paid your full normal weekly wages corresponding to the amount of hours you work.</p>
<p>For example, if you work more than 20 hours and usually earn $500 in-hand per week, then you should continue to be paid that. Your Kiwisaver and PAYE will still be deducted as per normal.</p>
<p>What about for part-time employees?</p>
<p>The exact same rationale applies for part time employees working less than 20 hours a week, except that a $350 wage subsidy per week is applied.</p>
<p>What if I have multiple jobs?</p>
<p>According to Work and Income, if you are an employee who is employed by two or more different businesses, you can receive the wage subsidy from multiple employers.</p>
<p>Likewise, if one or more of your jobs is classified as self-employed, then you can apply for one or more wage subsidies as long as you meet the usual criteria. Read this if you need more information about how to apply as a freelancer or self-employed contractor.</p>
<p>How is it paid?</p>
<p>For a full time worker, the wage subsidy will be a 12-week lump sum of $7029.60 paid to your employer. Your employer will then pay that to you on a weekly or agreed upon basis calculated on the above.</p>
<p>If you are self-employed it should be paid directly to you.</p>
<p>While many employers and self employed contractors are reporting the wage subsidy being paid out very quickly – some within two days of applying – it’s worth remembering that these are extraordinary circumstances and this massive scheme has been deployed in an incredibly short amount of time. Many businesses will be scrambling in different ways to take care of their employees while also balancing other responsibilities to keep their businesses from collapsing.</p>
<p>It won’t always go smoothly, and there may be issues. Make sure you stay in contact with employers to find ways forward and reach out to Work and Income if you need more support.</p>

<h3 id="business-labour-groups-say-liberals-covid-19-wage-subsidy-too-little-to-help">Business, labour groups say Liberals’ COVID-19 wage subsidy too little to help</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.thestar.com/mAQsmmiUwy-I4GRUMPcVjFm7xMM=/1280x1024/smart/filters:cb(1585078374770)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/business/2020/03/24/business-labour-groups-say-liberals-covid-19-wage-subsidy-too-little-to-help/JDT10452982.jpg" alt="img">
OTTAWA - A growing number of business and labour groups are urging the federal Liberals to up their promised wage subsidy to help companies hit hard by COVID-19 keep people on their payrolls.</p>
<p>The latest salvo came from the United Steelworkers union on Tuesday morning, around the same time the Canadian Federation of Independent Business panned the promise for not going far enough to save jobs.</p>
<p>The Liberals have promised small businesses a 10 per cent wage subsidy for 90 days, up to a maximum of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business.</p>
<p>There are calls for Ottawa to increase the subsidy to 75 per cent from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the federal New Democrats and Greens. The Steelworkers want it increased to 80 per cent as is being done in the U.K., which has also set a monthly cap of almost $4,000.</p>
<p>The Business Council of Canada and Canadian Chamber of Commerce have issued similar requests for more wage help.</p>
<p>Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the belief across all those groups is that helping employers retain workers, instead of paying the money through employment insurance or other similar benefits, will help the country get back into recovery mode quickly.</p>
<p>The Liberals have said their economic stimulus plan, which includes $27 billion in spending and $55 billion in tax deferrals, is only a start.</p>
<p>Canada, as part of a joint declaration Tuesday from G7 finance ministers and central bankers, agreed to do “whatever is necessary” to protect jobs and businesses, and urged other countries to follow suit as long as required.</p>
<p>YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN&hellip;</p>
<p>All the measures announced to date, coupled with the economic situation, likely puts the starting federal deficit for the coming fiscal year around $86 billion, up from the estimated $28.1 billion late last year, according to a Royal Bank report this week.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the Liberals will up the wage subsidy as in other countries, but likely not soon enough to stave off heavy job losses, said Kelly.</p>
<p>“Hearing everything is on the table, but not having any more meat on the table is wearing thin with the business community that is absolutely freaking out,” he said.</p>
<p>The job losses from the shock could be significant. The Conference Board of Canada estimated in a report Monday the economy could shed more than 330,000 jobs over the next two quarters.</p>
<p>“When someone is fired, the time it’s going to take for them to reapply to get a job, the effort it’s going to take for them to find new employment is colossal if you think about the scale and the magnitude of how many people are losing their jobs,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Monday in making the case for a wage subsidy of 75 per cent.</p>
<p>YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN&hellip;</p>
<p>Wage subsidies may be the fastest way to ensure that income continues to flow to households to cover essential costs and maintain their connection to the workforce, said Jennifer Robson, an associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Some businesses like big grocery stores won’t need the help, she said, but a subsidy might help others facing cash-flow and operational constraints — by being ordered to close, for instance — “hang on to more workers, even if at reduced pay relative to pre-crisis levels.”</p>
<p>Sheila Block, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said it may be more effective to deliver direct benefits to workers and use existing programs like employment insurance that act as automatic financial stabilizers instead of creating a new program.</p>
<p>Wage subsidies can help in traditional downturns, she said, but this isn’t one.</p>

<p>Businesses have been ordered to close and workers to stay home as policy-makers try to limit the spread of COVID-19, which has already thrown a wrench in supply chains and created uncertainty in financial markets over the depth and duration of the economic shock.</p>
<p>“It’s about helping businesses survive during this downturn &hellip; and it’s not clear to me that the wage subsidy is the right approach when we’re saying send your workers home,” Block said.</p>
<p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 24, 2020.

<h3 id="covid-19-wage-subsidy-too-small-says-cfib">Covid-19 wage subsidy too small, says CFIB</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.advisor.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/03/iStock-466824616.jpg" alt="img">
“It is essential that governments move quickly to safeguard local jobs and our economy by putting in place measures that will allow businesses to survive these unprecedented circumstances,” said Dan Kelly, CFIB president, in the release.</p>
<p>“Announcing a wage subsidy now will protect many jobs and keep employees connected to their employers, helping to speed the recovery when the Covid-19 emergency phase is over,” he said.</p>
<p>The federal government has announced provisions for a 10% wage subsidy for 90 days, up to a maximum of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per business.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by the CFIB shed light on the state of small business. It found that 60% have seen a significant drop in sales, with more than one-third reporting a reduction in gross sales revenues of more than 75%.</p>
<p>As as result, more than half of survey respondents have started to lay off staff, and one-quarter (25%) have laid off their entire workforces.</p>
<p>Further, more than half of survey respondents (53%) said they’ll be forced to consider more layoffs in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>“At this rate, the only way to prevent massive additional unemployment is for government to introduce a much larger wage subsidy program,” Kelly said in the release.</p>
<p>Nearly one in three businesses said they wouldn’t survive a month under current conditions, up from one-quarter the previous week, the survey found.</p>
<p>The national average cost of the outbreak for affected businesses was about $136,000, it said.</p>
<p>In addition to the wage subsidy, the CFIB is calling on the government to provide such things as income support for the self-employed, as well as various tax relief measures.</p>
<p>For more details on how the outbreak has affected small businesses, read the CFIB survey results.</p>
<p>About the CFIB survey: The survey was based on responses received online from more than 11,000 small-business owners across the country since March 20.
