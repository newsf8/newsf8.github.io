<p>THIS is the man who died after a vicious beating while out fishing, the Irish Sun can reveal.</p>
<p>Roy Hopkins, 34, was discovered with serious injuries at Glenaree Bridge, outside Rathangan, Co Kildare, after 9pm on Friday night.</p>
<p>4 Tragic Roy Hopkins</p>
<p>4 The scene near the river in Kildare was investigated by gardai</p>
<p>4 The river outside Rathangan, Co Kildare</p>
<p>It’s believed he had been fishing when he got into an altercation with another man which resulted in him suffering serious injuries.</p>
<p>Tragic Roy was taken to Naas General Hospital where he was subsequently pronounced dead.</p>
<p>A man in his 20s was later arrested and was last night being questioned by gardai at Kildare garda station.</p>
<p>The Irish Sun on Sunday has learned that it’s not the first tragedy to hit the Hopkins family.</p>
<p>The dead man’s sister Debbie passed away from cancer in 2014, while his father also died a number of years ago.</p>
<p>A source told us last night: “That poor family have been through a lot in recent years. Debbie was only in her earliy twenties when she died and she was an only girl with five brothers,</p>
<p>“This is a devastating blow to them all.”</p>
<p>DEVASTATING BLOW</p>
<p>The area where Roy was found is in a rural part of Co Kildare on the Grand Canal, in a spot popular with local fishermen.</p>
<p>Gardai called to his mother Caitriona’s house in Rathangan on Friday night to break the devastating news.</p>
<p>Local Fianna Fail councillor Anne Connolly said she knew the family well and it’s a heartbreaking time for them.</p>
<p>She told the Irish Sun on Sunday: “They are such a lovely family. Well-known and well-liked in Rathangan.</p>
<p>“The whole family extended family are all still in the area. They are such a big family, there’s a number of brothers, as well as uncles and aunts all still living locally.</p>
<p>“And they’re big contributors to the area too, giving back to the community.</p>
<p>COMMUNITY AFFECTED</p>
<p>“It was such a difficult time for them when Debbie died and now having to go through something like this is hard to comprehend.</p>
<p>“This is just unbelievably sad for them all and it has deeply affected the whole community of Rathanga.</p>
<p>“It’s been such a difficult time for everyone with the pandemic and now for something like this to happen around here is difficult to process.</p>
<p>“The place where the incident happened is such a beautiful spot, popular with people walking or cycling and of course fishing.</p>
<p>“The area is not known for having anything like this happening at all.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the circumstances of what happened. Someone said to me that he was fishing but that’s all I know about the incident, I couldn’t say for sure.”</p>
<p>GARDA INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>Yesterday a blue tent where Roy had been found was erected by gardai and a number of local officers had begun carrying out searches in the undergrowth for anything that might give them more information about what happened.</p>
<p>Some local young men arrived at the scene to go fishing and had been made aware of the man’s death.</p>
<p>One said: “I heard about it this morning and was shocked because it’s such a quiet area, nothing like that ever happens in here or even in Rathangan at all.</p>
<p>“I know of the chap who died but wouldn’t know him.</p>
<p>THOUGHTS WITH FAMILY</p>
<p>“It’s so sad for the family and our thoughts are with them. Hopefully the gardai can get to the bottom of what happened.”</p>
<p>Cops said that investigations into the killing were ongoing,</p>
<p>Gardai said: “Shortly after 9pm on Friday, 31st July 2020, a man in his 30s was discovered with serious injuries at Glenaree Bridge, Rathangan, County Kildare.</p>
<p>“The man was taken by ambulance to Naas General Hospital where he was subsequently pronounced dead.</p>
<p>“A post-mortem is scheduled to take place at a later date and will be conducted by the State Pathologist.</p>

<p>“The scene is currently preserved and the services of the Garda Technical Bureau has been requested.</p>
<p>“Investigations are ongoing.”

<p><img src="https://img.resized.co/newstalk/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLnJhZGlvY21zLm5ldFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjBcXFwvMDdcXFwvMzExMjM0MDFcXFwvbGVnLTI1NTQ3NTZfMTkyMC0xMDI0eDY4My5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cubmV3c3RhbGsuY29tXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9kZWZhdWx0X25vX2ltYWdlLnBuZ1wifSIsImhhc2giOiJlZDAwZjUxYWZiNGY4ZWEzNzYxNTIwMDA2MmMyZmE3ZjY5MzkxNzViIn0=/leg-2554756-1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="img">
A new campaign is being launched to remind people to be sun smart this summer.</p>
<p>The new &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Cook Yourself&rsquo; campaign by the Marie Keating Foundation is hoping to reduce the number of skin cancer diagnoses.</p>
<p>With over 11,000 cases annually, skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in Ireland.</p>
<p>This is twice the number compared to 10 years ago and is projected to more than double again by 2045.</p>
<p>Outdoor workers are seen as a high-risk group for the development of skin cancer, as they spend long periods outdoors.</p>
<p>They can be exposed to two to three times more UV radiation from the sun than indoor workers.</p>
<p>Liz Yeats, CEO, Marie Keating Foundation told Pat Kenny: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just launched a new campaign, highlighting the fact that essentially skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in Ireland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The number of cases are set to double by 2045, there are about 11,000 people diagnosed with skin caner every year - and about 1,100 people die from skin cancer unfortunately, which is one of the highest amongst the European Union.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get across the message that people need to be really sun smart when they&rsquo;re out in the garden this summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously everybody will be staycationing and we&rsquo;ll be out in our back gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So particularly if you&rsquo;re barbecuing, if you&rsquo;re outdoors for any other reason - even though it&rsquo;s Irish sun, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we need to take it any less seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can still get burnt under Irish sun through UV rays just as easily as you can in Portugal, or France or Spain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She said Irish people are generally at higher risk due to their skin types.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish people tend to have much fairer skin which burns more easily and tans poorly, so we&rsquo;re at higher risk of UV damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;UV damage and skin cancer is entirely preventable if people just take the precautions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re urging people through this &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Cook Yourself&rsquo; campaign to know the UV index.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s above three - and on a day like today for example, it&rsquo;ll be above three - and you can burnt get very quickly, particularly in the hours between 11 and 3.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The UV index goes from 3 to 8, but anytime between April and September it&rsquo;s higher than three - and the recommendation is that you protect yourself once it&rsquo;s above three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do that then by wearing sun screen: we recommend at least factor 30, but maybe factor 50 for children cause they obviously have more sensitive skin&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Siobhan McCarthy is a melanoma survivor.</p>
<p>She explained: &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t a sunbed person, I would have been on a couple of foreign holidays - or even just the good weather in Ireland, just sitting out the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have fairly pale skin, so I definitely shouldn&rsquo;t be sitting out in it - but as you do when you go on holiday, lay by the pool all day long&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She said she noticed a new mole on her skin when she was 20-years-old and living in Toronto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was on Skype one evening with my mam and she was like &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that on your arm?'&hellip;and she was like you need to go and get that checked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was 22 then when this conversation took place and she encouraged me to go the doctor straight away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t go straight away&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She said after she Googled about melanoma, she went to get it checked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I got the phone call to say this is melanoma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, luckily, I was able to have the mole removed and then they do a wide local excision it&rsquo;s called - they remove a chunk of skin basically all around that mole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I had a couple of lymph nodes removed as well to have those checked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankfully everything was all fine - there was no signs of melanoma then in my lymph nodes and the melanoma in my arm was after being removed and it got all clear margins all around that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is preventable if you take that time to go and get something - if you&rsquo;re worried about something - to go and get it checked out&rdquo;.</p>

CLAIRE Byrne looks set to leave her TV debate programme after landing the Today Show.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old claimed last week that getting the flagship mid-morning RTE radio show would ‘change my life’ — and she’s ready to make it the centre of her broadcasting activities.</p>
<p>2 Claire Byrne is set to take the Today Show gig Credit: Conor McCabe Ltd</p>
<p>2 Sarah McInerney temporarily hosted the radio show</p>
<p>As part of the reshuffle, current host Sarah McInerney is set to move into a TV role on a ­rotational basis.</p>
<p>An RTE insider told the Irish Sun: “Claire intends to give 100 per cent to the Today Show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be stepping into the shoes of previous Today hosts like Pat Kenny and Sean O’Rourke.</p>
<p>“You can’t be going head-to-head with politicians and at the same time worrying about a TV show that night.”</p>
<p>The Laois mother-of-three seemed to be strongly hinting recently that her Monday night Claire Byrne Live TV show would be a casualty if she was offered RTE’s flagship Today radio show.</p>
<p>RADIO SUCCESS</p>
<p>Speaking last week Claire said: “That job is two hours a day, five days a week, so it would be tough and I don’t know what it would mean for my TV show.”</p>
<p>The axeing of CBL could provide RTE with a consolation prize for Today Show stand-in Sarah McInerney.</p>
<p>Insiders say the Monday night slot could be replaced by an extra edition of Prime Time each week with McInerney as one of the rotating presenters.</p>
<p>Former Prime Time anchor David McCullagh is to take up the role as co-presenter of the RTÉ Six One News programme from September.</p>
<p>An RTE source said: “This would see Sarah going off to a very prestigious role on Prime Time after her success on Today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ironically, rival Claire getting the Today Show would make room for Sarah to join the PT team.”</p>
<p>RTE will announce O’Rourke’s successor on the Today Show next month with Miriam O’Callaghan ruling herself out of the role recently.</p>
<p>RTÉ did not respond to queries at the time of going to press last night.
