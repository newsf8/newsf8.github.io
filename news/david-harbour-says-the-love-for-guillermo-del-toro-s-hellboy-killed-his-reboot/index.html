With $44 million at the worldwide box office, Harbour&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hellboy&rdquo; reboot was a box office misfire.</p>
<p>David Harbour has had massive success on television thanks to his starring role on Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” but his film career in recent years hasn’t been as promising. Harbour was the face of Neil Marshall’s 2019 “Hellboy” reboot, which earned some of last year’s worst reviews and box office numbers. The film carried a $50 million production budget but only made $44 million worldwide. The gross at the domestic box office was a paltry $21 million. “Hellboy” was by all accounts a misfire, but Harbour says the project never stood a chance at success because of the animosity that surrounded the reboot from the start. The actor says “Hellboy” fans, many of whom adore Guillermo del Toro’s 2004 movie and its 2008 sequel, were against the film before cameras started rolling.</p>
<p>“I think it failed before we began shooting because I think that people didn’t want us to make the movie,” Harbour said on Instagram this week (via Screen Rant). “Guillermo del Toro and Ron Perlman created this iconic thing that we thought could be reinvented and then [fans] certainly — the loudness of the internet was like, ‘We do not want you to touch this.’ And then we made a movie that I think is fun and I think had its problems but was a fun movie and then people were just very very against it and that’s people’s right but I learned my lesson in a lot of different ways.”</p>
<p>Harbour previously said his “Hellboy” reboot was “unfairly bludgeoned” because moviegoers compare every tentpole these days to Marvel movies. The actor is right when he says del Toro’s “Hellboy” movies have a passionate and vocal following on the internet. Del Toro fans have long wanted the filmmaker to make a third “Hellboy” film, so there was backlash towards rebooting the franchise without del Toro and Perlman. Del Toro’s 2008 sequel “The Golden Army” was not a financial hit, which more or less killed his chances of directing a third movie. Del Toro pitched “Hellboy” creator Mike Mignola on an idea to turn his third movie into a comic book, but the author turned him down.</p>
<p>Popular on IndieWire</p>
<p>“I think del Toro mentioned it to me once, and I said no,” Mignola said last summer. “I think, let the comics be the comics. Comics are confusing enough for people. Let’s not have two different versions of the ‘Hellboy’ comic out there. My vote would be to say no.”</p>
<p>Fortunately for Harbour, his film career should bounce back in a big way later this year with “Black Widow.” The Marvel Cinematic Universe tentpole was originally scheduled for release on May 1 but will open sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Hellboy reboot star offers interesting reason for why the film totally flopped</p>
<p>David Harbour thinks fans of Guillermo del Toro&rsquo;s Big Red played a big part in why his Hellboy reboot failed.</p>
<p>During an Instagram Stories Q&amp;A with fans, the Stranger Things star opened up about the box office failure of director Neil Marshall&rsquo;s R-rated take on the iconic Dark Horse Comics character almost a year after its release. While a movie&rsquo;s ability to sink or swim is often chalked up to the strength of its narrative or the money behind its marketing campaign, Harbour believes something else sunk his spin on the hellish superhero, according to Digital Spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it failed before we began shooting, because I think that people didn&rsquo;t want us to make the movie,&rdquo; Harbour explained. &ldquo;Guillermo del Toro and Ron Perlman created this iconic thing that we thought could be reinvented and then they certainly — the loudness of the internet was like, &lsquo;We do not want you to touch this.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plans for another adaptation of Mike Mignola&rsquo;s world-destroying antihero initially caught some heat after it was announced that del Toro, who directed 2004&rsquo;s Hellboy and its 2008 sequel The Golden Army, would not be involved. Around the same time, del Toro also confirmed that a once discussed Hellboy 3 definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be happening either. The fan backlash to this creative decision by studio Lionsgate is something Harbour said he understands, however much it may have hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made a movie that I think is fun, and I think had its problems but was a fun movie, and then people were just very, very against it. And that&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s right, but I learned my lesson in a lot of different ways,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>General fan reluctance may have been part of why the reboot never caught fire, but there are plenty of other interesting reasons why the 2019 Hellboy wasn&rsquo;t successful.

<h3 id="david-harbour-blames-hellboy-reboot-failure-on-fans-of-original-movie">David Harbour Blames ‘Hellboy’ Reboot Failure On Fans Of Original Movie</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.screengeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hellboy-david-harbour-ron-perlman-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
Reboots can often be a dicey proposition, with 2019’s Hellboy being a great example of this. Despite featuring Stranger Things star David Harbour as the titular beast, as well as a refreshing grindhouse take on the comic book story, the reboot was met with unanimous dislike by critics (17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences alike. While there are several factors to blame for a movie’s failure, Harbour is setting his sights on fans of the original Guillermo Del Toro-directed/Ron Pearlman-led projects.</p>
<p>Speaking with ScreenRant, David Harbour said the reboot failed before it began shooting due to fans affinity with the Del Toro/Pearlman films. Here’s his take on his experience:</p>
<p>“I think it failed before we began shooting because I think that people didn’t want us to make the movie and for some reason there was like a big… Guillermo del Toro and Ron Perlman created this iconic thing that we thought could be reinvented and then they certainly – the loudness of the internet was like, “We do not want you to touch this.” And then we made a movie that I think is fun and I think had its problems but was a fun movie and then people were just very very against it and that’s people’s right but I learned my lesson in a lot of different way.”</p>
<p>While many will likely criticize Harbour for his comments, I do think he has a point. Too many people looked at the new Hellboy as a continuation of its predecessors, but its clear the Harbour-led project tried to do something vastly different. There is some shameless grindhouse fun to be had with the new Hellboy between it’s big, bloody setpieces and vulgar humor.</p>
<p>That being said, Hellboy 2019 was certainly a failure, with mixed creative goals going on behind the scenes likely affecting the product that was displayed for audiences. Unless Del Toro and Pearlman have a change of heart, it will likely be a long time before Hellboy is on the big screen again.</p>
