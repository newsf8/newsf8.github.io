<p>Tony Award-nominated actor Nick Cordero, 41, has died after a months-long battle with complications from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>His wife Amanda Kloots posted on Instagram Sunday night.</p>
<p>“My darling husband passed away this morning,” she wrote. “He was surrounded in love by his family, singing and praying as he gently left this earth.”</p>
<p>Kloots wrote of her pain in sharing the news.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“I am in disbelief and hurting everywhere,” she wrote. “My heart is broken as I cannot imagine our lives without him.”</p>
<p>“Nick was such a bright light,” Kloots wrote. She described him as “everyone’s friend,” a person who “loved to listen, help and especially talk.”</p>
<p>“He was an incredible actor and musician. He loved his family and loved being a father and husband. Elvis and I will miss him in everything we do, everyday,” she wrote, referring to their only child.</p>
<p>Kloots also paid tribute to Cordero’s doctor: “To Nick’s extraordinary doctor, Dr. David Ng, you were my positive doctor! There are not many doctors like you. Kind, smart, compassionate, assertive and always eager to listen to my crazy ideas or call yet another doctor for me for a second opinion. You’re a diamond in the rough.”</p>
<p>She then thanked everyone for “the outpour of love, support and help we’ve received these last 95 days.”</p>
<p>The Hamilton-born Broadway star’s hospitalization began at the end of March. He was admitted to the ICU at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Calif.</p>
<p>In early June, Kloots, 38, wrote on Instagram about how she had been told a “couple times that he won’t make it.”</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“Every day he’s still with us is a miracle,” her post said at the time.</p>
<p>Cordero had experienced complications during his treatment for COVID-19, including lung infections and blood clotting in his right leg. Kloots announced in mid-May that her husband had woken up from a medically induced coma, after having his right leg amputated just weeks earlier.</p>
<p>On July 2, she said Cordero might need a double lung transplant.</p>
<p>“In order to live the kind of life that I know my husband would want to live, that is a long road away and a lot of things would have to line up for Nick to be a candidate for that,” Kloots told show host Gayle King in a pre-taped interview on CBS This Morning.</p>

<p>Kloots has kept her social media updated with news of Cordero’s hospitalization and various complications over the past three months. People following her family’s saga would play her husband’s song Live Your Life.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“You have no idea how much you lifted my spirits at 3pm everyday as the world sang Nick’s song, Live Your Life,” she wrote on Sunday night.</p>
<p>His family sang the song to him on Sunday morning, she said.</p>
<p>“We sang it to him today, holding his hands. As I sang the last line to him, ‘they’ll give you hell but don’t you (let) them kill your light not without a fight. Live your life,’ I smiled because he definitely put up a fight,” Kloots wrote. “I will love you forever and always my sweet man.”</p>
<p>People posted about their grief over Cordero’s death on Twitter, shortly after the news broke Sunday night.</p>
<p>“RIP Nick Cordero! My condolences to you Amanda who fought and loved so hard….so sorry for his little one. My heart is with you,” tweeted Oscar-winning actor Viola Davis.</p>

<p>Cordero’s career involved playing a mob soldier on Broadway in 2014 in Woody Allen’s 1994 film adaptation of Bullets Over Broadway.</p>
<p>He received a Tony nomination for best-featured actor in a musical for that role. He moved to Los Angeles to star in Rock of Ages. He has appeared in several episodes of Blue Bloods and Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.</p>
<p>According to The Associated Press, the coronavirus has impacted other veterans of Broadway as well, including actors Danny Burstein, Tony Shalhoub, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Gavin Creel, Aaron Tveit, Laura Bell Bundy and composer David Bryan.</p>
<p>It has also claimed the life of Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally.</p>

<p>God has another angel in heaven now. My darling husband passed away this morning.

Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, help and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician. He loved his family and loved being a father and husband. Elvis and I will miss him in everything we do, everyday. To Nicks extraordinary doctor, Dr. David Ng, you were my positive doctor! There are not many doctors like you. Kind, smart, compassionate, assertive and always eager to listen to my crazy ideas or call yet another doctor for me for a second opinion. You’re a diamond in the rough.

<p>Skuespiller Nick Cordero er død</p>
<p>«Lilyhammer»-skuespiller Nick Cordero (41) tapte kampen mot coronaviruset. Han døde søndag morgen.</p>
<p>Oppdatert nå nettopp</p>
<p>Det bekrefter kona Amanda Kloots (38) på Instagram natt til mandag.</p>
<p>«Gud har fått en ny engel i himmelen nå. Min kjære ektemann døde i dag tidlig. Han var omringet av kjærlighet av familien,som sang og ba, mens han rolig forlot jorden», skriver hun.</p>
<p>«Jeg kan ikke forstå det, og det gjør vondt overalt. Hjertet mitt er knust fordi jeg ikke kan forestille meg livene våre uten ham», skriver hun videre.</p>
<p>De to har sønnen Elvis (1) sammen.</p>
<p>«Elvis og jeg vil savne ham i alt vi gjør – hver dag».</p>
<p>Cordero ble bekreftet smittet av coronaviruset for drøyt tre måneder siden.</p>
<p>Det er bare dager siden han kom ut av koma. I midten av april måtte den Tony Award-nominerte skuespilleren amputere høyrebenet som en følge av komplikasjoner i forbindelse med sykdommen. Cordero ble innlagt på intensivenheten ved Cedars-Sinai Medical Center i Los Angeles 31. mars og har siden vært innlagt – tidvis også bevisstløs.</p>
<p>«Jeg kan ikke begynne å takke alle for strømmen av kjærlighet, støtte og hjelp vi har fått de siste 95 dagene», skriver Kloots.</p>
<p>Cordero har spesialisert seg på å spille tøffing og er best kjent fra teaterscenene på Broadway. Han hadde en rolle i den norske serien «Lilyhammer» i 2014, samme år som han ble nominert til en Tony Award for innsatsen i Woody Allens «Bullets Over Broadway».</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-better-patient-care-with-improved-teleconsultation">&ldquo;Coronavirus: Better patient care with improved teleconsultation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/06/16/ST_20200616_VNTG2_5743130.jpg?itok=tCFhY60E" alt="img">
Embracing tech in Covid-19 fight</p>
<p>More than 200 doctors in the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP) have been trained to check on patients via video link as the group enhanced its tele-consultation services to ensure patients continue to get the medical help they need during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Consultant and head of special projects (primary care) at NHGP David Ng said patients had been worried about going down to clinics in person due to the outbreak.</p>
<p>There was also a need to ensure safe distancing at the group&rsquo;s six polyclinics.</p>
<p>Dr Ng said that NHGP had already been offering phone consultation services, which were handled only by nurses and did not involve video.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest problem with phone consultation is there is virtually no way to do any form of assessment of the patient. I can&rsquo;t see if you are looking quite pale or sickly - sometimes you can sound quite well over the phone, but you actually look under the weather,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>This, in turn, limits the types of patients who can receive help over the phone.</p>
<p>So, NHGP trained all its doctors to use videoconferencing software over the past three months, and had them complete a day-long online telemedicine course.</p>
<p>It also bought the necessary hardware and software for them to carry out teleconsultations, and established internal protocols for such sessions.</p>
<p>These enhancements have allowed NHGP to roll out a suite of teleconsultation services over the course of the Covid-19 outbreak, including consultations with psychologists, physiotherapists and dietitians.</p>
<p>More than 12,000 patients have opted to use these services since early April, and their response has largely been positive, said Dr Ng.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Covid-19 has brought about opportunities to change the way we work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is definitely a push to keep and sustain these services in the long run, even after the pandemic is over. It brings a lot of convenience to our patients, so it looks set to stay.&rdquo;
