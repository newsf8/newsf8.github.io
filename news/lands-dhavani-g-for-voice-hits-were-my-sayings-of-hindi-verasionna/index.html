<p>Gujarati filmmaker Dhwani Gautam recently released a Hindi version of Gujarati song Tari Mari Vaato from his film Order Order Out of Order recently titled Teri Meri Baatien . The song, which was originally written in Gujarati has been translated in Hindi to find a wider audience and the filmmaker has sung it himself. Dhwani, who admits to have enjoyed the process, is now planning to release a few more similar songs in the near future. Talking about it, Dhwani says, “The song was originally written in Hindi, but since we used it in my Gujarati film, it was translated in Gujarati. I saw a lot of people making cover versions of the song and that inspired me to do a Hindi version of it myself.” Dhwani, who has also written the Hindi lyrics for the song admits that he enjoyed doing this and now he wishes to make some more songs in the future. He says, “I have been working on this song for some time now and finally it has been released. I enjoyed doing this as a pilot project and now that I have got a hang of it, I plan to release some more songs in my voice very soon.”So, filmmaker turned singer Dhwani Gautam is surely raring to go and create some more beautiful music.

<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76083965,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-193019/76083965.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>For music lovers in Gujarat, there’s some great news. Badshah’s latest song Genda Phool, featuring Jacqueline Fernandez, has an official Gujarati version now. Singer Bhoomi Trivedi, who has penned the Gujarati lyrics for this soon-to-be-released version, shares, “While the rest of the song will remain as it was, it also has a few lines in Gujarati and I have written and sung the lyrics. I also feature in the music video, and have as much screen space as Badshah and Jacqueline.”</p>
<p>While working from home presented its own set of challenges, Bhoomi says that she enjoyed the experience. She shares, “I was excited when I got this offer, but I had only two days to complete everything. Right from writing the lyrics to recording without a sound engineer, doing hair and make-up, designing a set at home and choosing my own outfits and then ironing them before recording the video, I felt like a one-woman army who was on a mission. I was helped by a friend in certain aspects, but mostly I was on my own. Shooting with limited resources was a challenge, but we are happy with the results and even Badshah has loved it. I think all this multi-tasking has made me realise my true potential. I feel like an atmanirbhar musician now!”</p>
<p>Bhoomi adds, “Since all the studios are closed, I had to manage with whatever equipment I have at home. My room in Mumbai is not soundproof. Eventually, I recorded the song while sitting inside my wardrobe. I recorded the song well after midnight, when it is relatively quiet. I stayed up till 5 am on the day it was recorded.”</p>
<p>Bhoomi shares that she also worked hard to design a proper set at home before recording the video, “I am a movie buff and I notice all the minute details on movie sets. Mujh mein woh keeda hai. I worked hard to create a perfect look.”

‘WAS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT STEPPING OUT, BUT THRILLED TO BE BACK ON SET’</p>
<p>‘DOING MY OWN MAKEUP WAS FUN’</p>
<p>‘SAFETY MEASURES ARE MUST ON SET’</p>
<p>I just shot for a Gujarati song at Vastrapur Lake. Stepping outdoors after being homebound for 74 days was exciting as well as nerve-wracking. Since only a small crew (eight people) was present on the set, and I was assured that all safety measures will be followed, it seemed like the perfect start. Facing the camera again and doing what I love the most was thrilling. I am looking forward to doing more work now. I am hopeful life is returning to normal.The future looks promising for our industry, I am sure we will be back in action soon.As actors, we are so used to having stylist on the set, helping us with make-up and hair. But doing my own hair, make-up and styling was a very different experience. On any normal day at shoot, our makeup artiste keeps doing some touch up before every shot, all that was missing since we had very limited crew members on the set. I got my look right without a stylist. I think turning our own stylists is the new normal. I am sure this experience will be handy.Even though life is returning to normal gradually, we must not let our guard down and continue to follow all necessary precautions - masks, sanitisers, PPE suits (where required), face shields, doctor and ambulance on set - as we return to work. The fight against COVID-19 is far from over, and now that we are stepping out of our homes, it is even more important to be vigilant and take safety measures.

<p><img src="https://www.iwmbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/singer-dhvani-bhanushali-graduates.jpg" alt="img">
Dhvani Bhanushali has become the newest singing sensation in B-town. The 21-year-old singer is being called the next big thing in the Indian music industry, thanks to her fine voice and screen presence.</p>
<p>Well, besides her honey-coated voice, it’s her beautiful looks and cool girl-next-door style that makes her so relatable. Dhvani Bhanushali is an Indian model turned singer. She is a Maharashtrian by birth and she rose to fame with her carpool mashup of the songs “Shape Of You” and “Gulabi Aankhen,” alongside singer Sandesh Motwani.</p>
<p>Her passion for music led Dhwani to create a YouTube channel, which became the turning point of her career.</p>
<p>Dhvani was very popular in Bollywood since the beginning, but it was only after the release of her music video “Vaaste” that she gained immense popularity among the public. She is a very hardworking girl and has worked hard since the very beginning. She has beauty, brains as well as an amazing voice; well, a total package.</p>
<p>Apart from having an interest in music, Dhvani has also been brilliant at her studies. She did her schooling from a private school in Mumbai. Later, she enrolled in HR College of Commerce and Economics, Mumbai, to pursue her graduation in Business Management and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Today, she completed her graduation and shared a few pictures from her graduation ceremony and with her family on her social media. She captioned the picture as “Time to adult! Officially #graduated ”</p>

<p><img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/03/pjimage-25.jpg" alt="img">
On Sunday, as India observed Janata Curfew, singer Dhvani Bhanushali quietly observed turning 22 with a noble gesture. On her birthday, the Vaaste singer donated Rs 50,000 to the Film and Television Producers Guild of India, for daily wage workers whose incomes have stopped due to the lockdown of the entertainment industry in the wake of coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being a part of this industry, I have seen what goes on behind the cameras. From the spot boys to cameramen to even the ones who make and serve the food, work throughout the day and night so that we can do our best to entertain the audience. I felt really bad when I came to know that, due to the situations we are facing today, they won&rsquo;t have any means of earning. I wanted to do something special for them,&rdquo; Dhvani said.</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;When I came to know about the contribution The Film &amp; Television Producers Guild of India is making towards the daily wage workers, as a thank you for looking after minute details of the camera, I decided to pitch in a small amount of my income to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a recent interview to IANS, Dhvani spoke about her Bollywood journey and her dream of becoming India&rsquo;s &ldquo;pop icon&rdquo; someday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dream to become India&rsquo;s pop icon. That dream is going to be fulfilled through non-film songs. It also gives me a chance to feature in my own videos and the song is associated to my face and name instead of being a voice for someone else&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; Dhvani had said.

Singer Dhvani Bhanushalis single Vaaste has been named the top song of 2019 by International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), an organisation that represents the recorded music industry worldwide.</p>
<p>Dhvani&rsquo;s voice is well complemented by the vocals of Nikhil D&rsquo;Souza in the song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it has sunk in yet. Ever since Vaaste released in April 2019, I continue to be overwhelmed by the immense love people have given it. The messages that I am still getting of how people are enjoying the song, the lyrics, the video, are mind-blowing. I wanted to reach out to people but I never thought that we would come this far,&rdquo; said Dhwani.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be named as the top song of last year, especially since we had such amazing music come out from so many different platforms and genres, is an honour and achievement that I cherish. I promise my fans that I will work even harder now to make sure I keep making them happy with my music,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Dhvani recently released the song Jeetenge Hum, which she shot at home with her father Vinod Bhanushali. The song is dedicated to those who are helping people to fight against the global pandemic. IANS
