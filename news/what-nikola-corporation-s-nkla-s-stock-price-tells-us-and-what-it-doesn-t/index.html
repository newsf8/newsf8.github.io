<p>What Nikola Corporation’s (NKLA’s) Stock Price Tells Us … And What It Doesn’t</p>
<p>June 25th, 2020 by Frugal Moogal</p>
<p>On Thursday, May 4th, Nikola Corporation slipped quietly onto the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol NKLA, opening at $37.55 a share, and then it spent the rest of it’s debut week bouncing around near that price before more than doubling on Monday, May 8th, when it closed at $73.27. As I write this, the stock is continuing to hover around that price, which puts the market capitalization of Nikola Corporation at around $26 billion.</p>
<p>At first I wasn’t planning on covering Nikola’s stock. In fact, I have been so distracted by my usual day job that I didn’t even realize Nikola was having an IPO until after it happened and the stock had started on its run, which made headlines. By the time this happened, a lot of other analysts had done very solid work looking at Nikola’s business, and I didn’t feel I could add much to that. But, now, a few weeks later, and a few days before Nikola begins pre-orders for its Badger Electric Pickup Truck, I feel like a lot of analysts have overlooked the forest for the trees, so to speak, and are missing the big lesson we should see in Nikola. On the flip side, it seems like many have drawn conclusions about the company due to the stock price that perhaps they shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>(Before going on, a quick note: From here on I’m going to refer not to Nikola’s “price,” but to its “market cap.” Stock price by itself really doesn’t tell us anything, unless you’re also looking at how many shares are outstanding, and that’s how you get market cap … market cap can tell us a lot.)</p>
<p>What NKLA’s Market Cap Doesn’t Tell Us</p>
<p>Let’s start with what Nikola Corporation’s market cap doesn’t tell us: It doesn’t tell us that the company can execute on any of it’s plans.</p>
<p>And Nikola has a lot of plans: The “Nikola World” event in April of 2019 unveiled 5 new electric vehicles. The company unveiled a line of electrified Powersport Vehicles aimed at convincing the public of its EV technology capability. The company plans to create a network of hydrogen refueling stations.</p>
<p>But none of these plans have actually become a real-world product yet. The history of the stock market is littered with companies that told people they had an incredible business plan and tons of great products. Many of those companies saw big gains in their market cap … and then came crashing back down to earth when people realized promises don’t equal products.</p>
<p>To be clear — I’m not hoping that Nikola will fail. In fact, I hope Nikola succeeds and proves that it can bring all of it current plans to market as quickly as it claims. I think that will be difficult, however. A lot of other clean energy analysts have done some great deep dives into what they think about Nikola and its prospects, and I don’t feel that I have much to add here for now.</p>
<p>What I can say is that I have been personally leery of companies that haven’t released a viable product since I was burned a bit by the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. I can also say that I believe that there will be a place for hydrogen in the future clean-energy economy. I don’t know if Nikola will be the company to bring that about.</p>
<p>There is a lot that I do like about what Nikola has said, however. I like that it plans to generate all of its hydrogen onsite, using renewable energy sources to create it. I like that it plans to build out a hydrogen network using its semi trucks as demand drivers to do so. It’s just — without seeing some actual products, it’s hard to know if the company’s timelines and costs will really be what they say they are.</p>
<p>In other words, Nikola’s market cap doesn’t tell us what Nikola can do as a company. It does show us something else, however …</p>
<p>What Nikola’s Price Does Tell Us</p>
<p>While I feel Nikola’s market cap doesn’t tell us what the company can do, I feel it shows something else that should give fans of clean technology a real positive feeling.</p>
<p>Let’s look at that market cap for a minute again. As I write this, Nikola’s market cap is a bit over $26 billion. If we compare that to other automakers, it’s an incredible price. Fiat Chrysler currently clocks in with a market cap of $20 billion. Ford is at $24 billion.</p>
<p>Sure, there are other automakers worth more, but the difference here is that Fiat Chrysler and Ford have tons of factories, and have produced tons of products. Nikola is currently valued almost exclusively based on the promise of better technology, and a greener future.</p>
<p>While other automakers (and many analysts) keep saying that the clean transportation revolution is a long way off, the technology isn’t mature, and the industry shouldn’t receive such high valuations, there is clearly a significant amount of money in the market right now that believes that there is money to be made in clean technologies and their stocks.</p>
<p>The market is telling yet another story as well, and it’s one that will push the green revolution forward faster and faster.</p>
<p>Nikola’s Market Cap Will Pressure Other Automakers</p>
<p>Imagine you are a Ford shareholder right now. Your company made and sold over 5.4 million vehicles worldwide last year. Almost 1 million of those vehicles were the popular F-Series trucks, the top selling vehicle in the world, and in a segment known for its margins and profitability. Yet, Nikola, a company that has sold zero products so far, has managed to create a market cap for itself larger than Ford’s just based on a plan for how it will dominate the electric market moving forward.</p>
<p>And it gets worse — not just has this newcomer created a market cap larger than Ford’s, if you’ve held your Ford stock for any length of time, your investment has declined significantly. If you have held your stock for 5 years, it’s lost over 40% of it’s value … including dividends. Nikola hasn’t been around since then, so you might look at Tesla to try to see how its market cap might increase. In the past five years, Tesla’s market cap increased over 350% in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Let’s put it in actual terms — a $10,000 investment in Ford on June 25, 2015, would, including dividends, be worth $5,805.19 as I write this. A $10,000 investment in Tesla for the same time period would be worth $36,481.34. An investment in Tesla would have done six times better than an investment in Ford.</p>
<p>As an investor (in Ford), you’re looking at two transportation companies, and they’re telling you the same story — the future is in these clean transportation methods, and you’re concerned you’re holding shares of a dinosaur as the meteor strikes. If you’re paying attention to your investments, you’re going to do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sell your shares, worried that Ford will continue it’s downward slope, to reallocate your resources to other companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demand that Ford, which has all these factories and production skills, hurries along its investment in clean technology.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For their part, some of these companies have started to wake up. Ford created Team Edison that managed to copy Tesla design the Mustang Mach-E in just two years, for example.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Pressure to continue to create new products will only get stronger, with the market awarding those perceived to be moving quicker, and punishing those who aren’t. Investors will pressure automakers to overcome dealer networks hostile to selling electric vehicles and increase production of electric vehicles. Companies that do will be rewarded with higher share prices.</p>
<p>This creates a feedback loop to benefit those who transition to new products sooner, which will only serve to accelerate the entire transition.</p>
<p>Nikola Corporation’s market cap may not tell us much about the future of Nikola, but it tells us a lot about just how viable investors feel the clean transportation market is, and the opportunity that it presents. The question now is how will those other companies respond?</p>
<p>Disclaimer</p>
<p>I am a Tesla shareholder who has purchased shares within the preceding 12 months. I am not currently a Nikola Corporation shareholder, nor do I intend to initiate a position in Nikola Corporation any time soon. Research I do for articles, including this article, may compel me to increase or decrease stock positions. However, I will not do so within 48 hours after any article in which I discuss matters that I feel may materially affect stock price is published. I do not believe that my voice could or should influence stock price by itself, and I strongly caution anyone against using my work as your sole data point to choose to invest or divest in any company. My articles are my opinion, which was formulated using research based on publicly available data. However, my research or conclusions may be incorrect.</p>

<h3 id="quick-guide-to-select-the-right-investment-plan-to-create-wealth">&ldquo;Quick Guide to Select the Right Investment Plan to Create Wealth&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.mumbailive.com/images/news/images_1530714838434_pension.jpg?bg=9b6d53&amp;crop=1368%2C768%2C0%2C0&amp;fit=fill&amp;h=606.3157894736842&amp;height=768&amp;w=1080&amp;width=1368" alt="img">
Financial planning is essential for all individuals as it not only helps in meeting the present but also future goals along dealing with unforeseen emergencies in life. In short, it provides much needed financial security that we all thrive for in life. Further, with the rapid rise in inflation in India, daily expenses tend to erode the value of savings, and an investment plan can help you in wealth creation efficiently. Financial planning via diversification also helps to harness the power of compounding and reduce the uncertainties arising from a volatile market scenario.</p>
<p>What is power of compounding? Simply put, it refers to the strategy that makes your money grow by earning interests on the principal amount as well as the accumulated interest over successive periods. So, to gain the maximum benefits from the power of compounding, make sure you choose the best investment options for your portfolio.</p>
<p>Below are a few pointers that will enable you to select the best investment optionsfor yourself and your family:</p>
<p>Focus on Financial Goals</p>
<p>We all have different financial goals in life, be it long term or short term. Some milestones are significant in life. Be it buying a family car, your own house, your children&rsquo;s&rsquo; education or their marriage; it is your responsibility to fulfil these needs. The alignment of these goals with the right investment plan is what matters the most.</p>
<p>Making a smart investment choice can make your financial life better. It will help in providing you with enough funds to make your dreams fulfilled.So,it would help if you enlisted your financial goals according to the horizon and then categorize them accordingly.</p>
<p>While enlisting your financial goals, there are mainly two types&ndash; need-based goals and want-based goals. You must understand what your need is and should cover them as your priority. Thus, after covering your needs, you can plan for your wants with the surplus available with you.</p>
<p>Consider Current Liabilities</p>
<p>When you start with your financial planning, you should first check the status of your net worth? What is your current net worth? What are your existing assets and liabilities?</p>
<p>An investment plan helps in understanding your current financial situation in a better way. It becomes easy for you to evaluate investment or retirement plan by having a sound financial understanding.Make sure you are aware of all the existing financial liabilities before making an investment plan. Analyze how realistic your goals are and how much you require to achieve them.</p>
<p>Compare Plans in Terms of their Benefits</p>
<p>When building your financial portfolio, it is crucial to explore the best investment options. Research is, therefore, the primary task before investing your money. If you are investing in the stock market, research the company&rsquo;s history and performance, financial ratios, future growth and other factors.</p>
<p>With proper research, you can understand the different investment avenues and the risk associated with them. Research tells you which plan of investment is relatively safer for you, and which can expose you to volatility. Accordingly, you can make an investment planthat has multiple options to protect you from losing money in one particular investment.</p>
<p>Diversify Investment</p>
<p>There are several investment options available today, such as equities, bonds, and rel-estate. Each of these has different characteristics, and a good investment plan will usually contain a mix of all of these. Include the most suitable mixture of investments to each specific goal in the most efficient way. From the outset, it is essential to build a strong foundation, and as your circumstances change as time pass and you need to make necessary adjustments to keep on track.</p>
<p>As it is said not to put all your eggs in one basket, diversification is the key to a successful investment plan. You can better manage and improve the balance between risk and return by spreading your money across different investment options. Diversification can help you smooth out the returns while still achieving financial growth and reduce the overall risk in your investment plan.</p>
<p>Be Open-Minded and Invest Wisely</p>
<p>Before investing your money in any investment product, solid investment planning is required. If you do not put enough thought to the planning process, then all your investments can turn into a big mess. Therefore, an investment plan is crucial to your financial portfolio and life goals.</p>
<p>Different goals require a separate investment plan, such as for retirement or child education; you need to create two unique strategies. Investment plans offer various ways to invest your money as well as insure yourself. You can choose from ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans) to Online Saving Plans for the dual benefit of insurance and investment. So, research and determine your goals to make a robust and efficient investment plan.

<h3 id="how-to-plan-for-a-kitchen-renovation-dont-buy-appliances-first">&ldquo;How to plan for a kitchen renovation: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t buy appliances first&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/y/m/y/h/t/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.20lutv.png/1593555105820.jpg" alt="img">
Kiwis voted this kitchen by Jaimi Brunton the &lsquo;most likeable&rsquo; in last year&rsquo;s NKBA awards. The Te Awamutu designer works for Native Timber Joinery.</p>
<p>Planning and designing a kitchen renovation is not straightforward, and it&rsquo;s all the more tricky because most of us only do it once or twice in a lifetime, if ever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a lot easier if you do your homework first, before you call in a designer. And that&rsquo;s because there are a few basic things to consider that will save you time and money later.</p>
<p>The National Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Association (NKBA) has a checklist that helps you sort out exactly what it is you want, and it&rsquo;s all about planning.</p>
<p>Alden Williams/Homed Will you prefer your refrigerator and dishwasher integrated with the cabinetry? Christchurch NKBA designer Davinia Sutton is pictured in an NKBA award-winning client&rsquo;s kitchen.</p>
<p>CONSIDER APPLIANCES</p>
<p>Right at the top of that list are appliances. Will you be needing a double oven? Do you want an induction cooktop, a double fridge or single, a freestanding oven or built-in?</p>
<p>Auckland kitchen designer Shane George agrees researching appliances is a great start: &ldquo;Many appliance showrooms have cooking demonstrations, and that&rsquo;s really helpful, especially if you want to try out something new, such as a steam oven. And these are the future of cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But George also says, while it&rsquo;s important to research, it&rsquo;s not a good idea to go rushing out to buy appliances before you and your designer have worked out a concept. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about functionality, but appliance aesthetics sometimes get overlooked and they are really important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Designer Natalie Du Bois of Auckland says she has had clients &ldquo;impulse buying&rdquo; all their appliances in a sale before work has started on the kitchen, only to find they simply won&rsquo;t work with the subsequent kitchen design and layout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are then faced with having to get rid of those appliances and start again. More often than not, it turns out to be a bad decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ANALYSE THE WAY YOU WORK</p>
<p>George says it&rsquo;s equally important to analyse how you live and work in your current kitchen, so you can communicate that clearly to your designer. &ldquo;You may think you want a scullery, but it may not suit the way you like to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jamie Cobel The owners of this kitchen designed by Shane George wanted a coffee station at home. Everything they need is right at hand.</p>
<p>Take a look at your existing storage and decide what&rsquo;s not working. Is it hard to access items? Do you need more storage for large platters or the myriad small appliances you have collected over the years? (And this is a good time to discard any items you haven&rsquo;t used for more than a year.)</p>
<p>Look at kitchens on Instagram and designer projects online and make a note of what you do and don&rsquo;t like – it could be corner pantries are not your thing, or open shelving.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t like the idea of the sink against a wall with no window. Or perhaps you really don&rsquo;t want a sink on the island. Bearing in mind, some compromise is always needed, even in high-end kitchens.</p>
<p>supplied Trudi Rabbitte of Rabbitte Joinery in Hastings received an NKBA Kitchen Distinction Award for this kitchen, which features a baking centre and open shelving for cookbooks and decorative items.</p>
<p>Your designer also needs to know what future changes may need to be accommodated in terms of family size, aging-in-place requirements and potential resale.</p>
<p>ENGAGE A DESIGNER EARLY</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to get a designer on board early if you are undertaking a renovation. &ldquo;Many people leave it too late, often after a builder has started work,&rdquo; says Du Bois. &ldquo;They think they can do it on their own, but they get really confused, and then they engage us. There is a better outcome if we are hired earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitchens are expensive and you need to be able to make decisions without feeling rushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>KEEP AN OPEN MIND</p>
<p>Keeping an open mind is also critical. &ldquo;People get used to the way their current kitchen, and it can be hard to think beyond that,&rdquo; says George. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s important to realise you are not restricted by what you have at the moment, and that is why you engage a designer. We look at adjoining rooms and can often realise potential you didn&rsquo;t think was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to push people a little outside their comfort zone, and it&rsquo;s so rewarding to see how happy they are in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bois talks about a recent project, where she was able to add a large scullery to a kitchen by reducing space in the massive guest bathroom next door, which was not used a lot. &ldquo;That room is still beautiful, but more compact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>KALLAN MACLEOD This new kitchen designed by Natalie Du Bois incorporates a large scullery that was created by reducing the size of the guest bathroom behind.</p>
<p>Trust is an important part of the process, Du Bois says: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to research designers, and once you have found someone you get on with, it&rsquo;s best to have a positive approach – when you work as a team, you get a better result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George says designers have the advantage of product knowledge. They are seeing new products, technology and materials every day. And while clients will sometimes want a particular style they think is on trend, that may not be the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice is &lsquo;don&rsquo;t restrict yourself&rsquo;,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Kallan Macleod The new scullery provides a lot of extra storage, plus a second sink.</p>
<p>LONGEVITY</p>
<p>How long do you want your kitchen to last? Buying quality materials will cost more initially, but they will last longer and be less wasteful. &ldquo;If someone is planning a kitchen and bathroom renovation on the cheap, I would recommend holding off the bathroom for a few years and doing a better job of the kitchen,&rdquo; says Du Bois.</p>
<p>supplied This butler&rsquo;s pantry, in a kitchen designed by Shane George, vanishes from sight once the doors are closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be putting in an inferior kitchen to then have to replace it in 10 years&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MONEY MATTERS</p>
<p>When it comes to budget, the NKBA puts it bluntly: &ldquo;Be honest and realistic – don’t forget to factor in all your appliances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You absolutely must have a dollar figure in mind. If your budget is modest – that’s completely fine; the designer will find products and solutions to suit. If you have grandiose ideas – they also need to know, so you are not disappointed with a modest design concept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And remember, mortgage interest rates are the lowest they have been in living memory, so you may be able to borrow a little more to get the kitchen you really want. So long as you don&rsquo;t go crazy with ultra-expensive materials, a new kitchen is an investment that will pay for itself when you come to sell your house.</p>
<p>STUFF Davinia Stutton and Leonie Metger were the only finalists in the International Designer of the Year award. Here are the three shortlisted kitchens.</p>
<p>REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS</p>
<p>Anyone who has undergone a renovation can tell you about the challenges. The NKBA simply says: Be realistic about how you will manage your life. It really can’t be sugar coated – you are having the heart ripped out of your home. Be prepared for what lies ahead and put some thought into how you and your family will manage this.</p>
<p>Consider that you will have complete strangers in your house, children and pets will need to be kept clear of work and egress areas and there will be a lot of noise, inconvenience and dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of course, with the right planning the end result will be well worth it.

<h3 id="we-need-sellers-who-sell-not-take-orders">&ldquo;We Need Sellers Who “Sell,” Not Take Orders&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.business2community.com/B2C_FB.png" alt="img">
I suppose, after all the years I’ve spent working with “sales people,” I shouldn’t be surprised. But I continue to be stunned by how few people who are in sales roles, truly sell.</p>
<p>Too many are information concierges with an agenda. They are dependent on a prospect finding them, who has done all the heavy lifting. They’ve determined they have a problem, they are doing their homework, they have questions.</p>
<p>Need discovery in these cases is not about the customer business needs, challenges, but about the product or service the customer seeks.</p>
<p>Changing customer views is more about shifting their thinking to favor our company, product, solutions, than helping the customer rethink their business.</p>
<p>Rather than helping guide the customer through their buying process and achieving their goals, they respond, wait, follow the customer cues, then ask, “when will you order,” or as I saw with a sales person recently, “My company needs the order this quarter, perhaps we can work a deal….”</p>
<p>In this world, the ideal “SAL,” (Sales Accepted Lead) is a customer with a PO in hand. In this world, “value creation,” is all about discounting. In this world, understanding the customer’s business, helping them identify opportunities to improve, helping them navigate their buying process, is foreign.</p>
<p>These “sellers,” are always busy, after all there is always one more piece of content, or making the calls, “when are you planning on ordering?” They love meetings and phone calls, thinking these are progress. They create excuses for meeting, “can I tell you about this feature,” “can we do a demo,” “do you want to talk to one of our technical people,” “are you the decision maker,” “when do you expect to order.” Their pipelines are filled with wishful thinking, “They are interested.” Their deals slip and slip and slip.</p>
<p>Recommended For You</p>
<p>Register Now</p>
<p>One might think these “sales people” are focused on the simplest, transactional deals. Sadly, I encounter this with those addressing the most complex, highest value deals. I see organizations paying $100’s of thousands to each of these order takers.</p>
<p>And many of these order takers are proud, “Look at the big deals I closed, I was the top performer for the quarter/year…” It’s less because of what they did, more because they were there when the customer was ready to place an order.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it’s the dominance of these order takers that is why the percent of sales people making plan continues to decline. Perhaps, this is why customers are looking for other sources/channel of information. It’s not so much an aversion to sales people, but simply the fact they aren’t helpful. There are easier and more efficient ways for them to learn, so customers minimize the time they need with those sales people.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean our customers don’t need help. It doesn’t mean they don’t need sales people–though too many leaders misunderstand this, Customers need help, they want help–particularly in these times.</p>
<p>They need to learn, to see new opportunities, to recognize they can and must change. They recognize the don’t know what they don’t know, and need help understanding that. They need help understanding what change means, they need help understanding the risks and how they might address them. They need help navigating their buying process and in gaining support within their own organizations.</p>
<p>And this is what sellers who “sell” do. And those that do this stand out in their organizations and to their customers. It is these sellers that are consistently the top performers. Sellers recognize they are selling change–not a product or service. They recognize how people struggle with recognizing the need to change, deciding to change, managing the change process.</p>
<p>There is so much opportunity. Buyers want and need guidance, leadership, and help. Customers are struggling to grow and change. They need people that can help them understand and navigate that—top performing sellers.</p>
<p>Our customers need people who sell, not order takers. Our companies need people who sell, not order takers.

<h3 id="2019-audi-e-tron-makes-wards-10-best-interiors-list">&ldquo;2019 Audi e-tron Makes ‘Wards 10 Best Interiors’ List&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.quattrodaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/audi-e-tron-suv-27-of-54.jpg" alt="img">
One of the very best aspects of the Audi e-tron SUV is its interior. Considering the fact that Audi claims the e-tron to be a luxury Audi first and an electric car second (electric has gone Audi, says the tagline), it needs to have a truly luxurious interior and it does. It’s also one that’s been recognized by Wards Auto as one of the “Wards 10 Best Interior” winners.</p>
<p>“This is a beautifully executed interior with matte-finish wood, supple leather and a metallic palm-rest shifter that is handsome, ergonomically easy to use and unlike anything we’ve seen before,” said Tom Murphy, WardsAuto managing editor. “The Pearl Beige interior makes the e-tron a sanctuary of relaxation, a place to unwind after a hectic day, while the all-electric drivetrain hums away in near silence. Yes, Audi continues to show us the way of future luxury interiors, even in the age of electrification.”</p>
<p>It shows that Audi wanted the e-tron to be a genuinely luxurious Audi SUV and not just some tech-fest with a gadget-filled interior. Zee Germans were far more concerned with quality, refinement and NVH levels than adding virtual whoopee cushions. And it shows.</p>
<p>But it’s not just interior materials that got the Audi e-tron recognized. Its powertrain delivery, lack of noise from the wind and tires and just its overall sense of calm and quiet.</p>
<p>“The Audi e-tron SUV offers all of the premium amenities one would expect of an Audi with the nearly silent, immediate torque that is inherent with an EV,” said Filip Brabec, VP of Product Planning, Audi of America. “With the e-tron, Audi continues its commitment to using the highest-quality materials together with smart packaging, always aiming to capture our customers’ imaginations. We’re proud to see Wards recognize the e-tron with a 10 Best Interiors award, a testament to the hard work and collaboration of our designers and engineers.”</p>
<p>Drive the Audi e-tron back-to-back with other EVs and you can tell that the e-tron is a luxury SUV first and foremost, it just so happens to be electric. Its interior is that good and, evidently, it’s not just us telling you that.

<p><img src="https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76741860,imgsize-131999,width-800,height-434,overlay-etbrandequity/5-reasons-why-marketers-should-use-audio-now.jpg" alt="img">
By Arjun Kolady As I speak with marketing leaders across the industry, one thing is clear - they are reworking their strategies, and planning for the future, whatever that looks like. Many of them are considering audio for different reasons, but at the heart of it all lies the fact that audio truly touches everything - it’s mobile, personal, social, interactive, engaging, emotional.On an average the Indian user spends 2.5 hours per day on audio. Billions of minutes are spent on digital audio every month in India. 80% of this time, they can’t be reached through visual media. As per eMarketer, digital audio will surpass radio listening globally this year, which means if your marketing is largely display or video driven, you are missing out on valuable time with your consumer.If you are wondering how to get ahead of the curve as you think about audio for your brand, here are five things to consider.1. ALL THE TIME, EVERYWHEREConsumers spend time on audio throughout the day, across devices. You can be there.The great part about the 2.5 hours spent on audio per day, is that it is throughout the day. Audio is now in our homes with connected speakers, on our wrists, and even in our cars, and it’s the only element that has the ability to cut across this ecosystem. We’re with audio when we work, do chores, cook, workout, or play. This ubiquity of audio allows you to engage with consumers wherever they are, however they are listening. Imagine being able to have a different message based on whether your consumer was listening in a car, on a PlayStation, or home speaker.2. ACTUAL MOMENT MARKETING Music is contextual. It tells you moods, moments and mindsets,The great thing about music is that it provides context. It reflects how you are feeling, and what you are doing. Say, you could reach a mom in Mumbai, when she listens to focus playlists in the afternoon as she works from home, and sleep playlists when she’s finally in bed, or even putting her kids to bed. What message would you deliver? How can you be a part of that moment in an authentic way? Audio allows you to go well beyond primary data related to age, gender, location, and device type and really own a moment. Audio brings moment marketing to life.3. THE THEATRE OF THE MINDBecause audio has no boundaries on what storytelling can look likeAudio is the oldest form of communication. Our brains process information through audio 22x faster than through visualizations. Audio triggers emotions, stirs memories, paints pictures, and motivates people into action. Have you ever stepped away from the daily hustle, closed your eyes, and just hit play? We all have.Brands can use this deep connection to provide an elevated sensory experience with a full sonic palette - ASMR, 3D audio, immersive effects, entertaining narration, and great music - to tell stories that people remember. Real time dynamic audio can create thousands of creatives on the fly, to be personalized and in the moment. You can do sequential messaging, telling a story from one ad to the next. And because this can be done in a personal, one to one manner with no clutter, audio is disruptive without disturbing.4. VIDEO. YES, THAT’S RIGHT.Multi-format campaigns drive higher brand lift.Why video on audio platforms? Because it works. Multiformat campaigns (audio &amp; video) showed a 1.8x greater increase in ad recall than video ads alone. From playful statics and creative videos during screen time, to immersive audio as the user moves to non-screen devices, multimedia campaigns ensure that brands complement the user’s device journey. It’s a combination of using billions of data points, storytelling, and ubiquity across devices, to appeal to a consumer’s ears and eyes. Measure viewability, completions, and on target performance, and you may be pleasantly surprised by how well it works.5. MORE THAN JUST MUSICThere’s a podcast for that.Podcasts have been around for over a decade, and they’re finally having a moment in the spotlight. This will be a whole new opportunity for advertisers. Spotify research shows that a staggering 81% of listeners have taken an action after hearing audio ads during a podcast. This could be researching a product online, connecting with the brand on social media or talking about the brand with others. More and more people are turning to podcasts for reflection, education, and entertainment. They provide an opportunity for the brand to have a voice, own a part of culture, and celebrate niches in meaningful ways.The future is NOWEach brand campaign calls for a different marketing approach - whether it’s online or offline, video or audio, ATL or BTL etc. If we only look at digital videos, advertising has outstripped time spent, and is increasingly crowded and expensive; this is substantiated by the fact that digital video is 27% of all video time, but accounts for 34% of video spend. Audio, on the other hand, has much higher time spent, and advertising is just starting to get creative there. This is the time for brands to experiment on audio now, to be future ready.

<h3 id="we-would-like-to-contribute-to-the-success-of-make-in-india-and-the-growth-of-solar-in-india-sunil-badesra">&ldquo;We would like to contribute to the success of “Make in India” and the growth of solar in India: Sunil Badesra&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.saurenergy.com/2020/07/sunil-badesra-business-head-sungrow-india.jpg" alt="img">
Its 3 GW manufacturing plant in India is the only one outside China for Sungrow. 2 years later, the investment has been vindicated, with the plant serving the domestic as well as export market successfully. We caught up with Sunil Badesra, Business Head, Sungrow India on the story so far.</p>
<p>Tell us about the Sungrow journey so far in India.</p>
<p>Sungrow was one of the earliest global firms to sense the future potential of Indian solar market. Our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Bengaluru, with a capacity of 3GW per annum was a backing of this insight. The facility spread across 130,000 sqft area can produce 2GW central inverters and 1GW string inverters annually. Our India manufacturing unit now employs more than 75 people. So far, we have supplied more than 3.5GW of PV inverters to India and global market while exports having higher share. After 6 years in the India market today, we sell our products through both Direct Sales and Distributors Network to cater to every consumer segment.</p>
<p>Q. We understand this is the only overseas production facility for Sungrow outside China. How did you pick India for the same? What are the future plans for expansion if any, or product mix from the plant?</p>
<p>Sunil Badesra, Business Head, Sungrow India</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, India is one of the big solar markets in the world today. Back in 2014, India had also set a clear and ambitious road map for solar capacity addition which made it one of the most attractive solar markets. Sungrow as an industry leader and staying ahead of the curve, took a long-term view of Indian market strategically. Looking at the market potential in India and its geographical advantage to export to other regions, it became a natural choice to set up the factory in India. We have built a strong foundation here and as the market grows further, we are open to explore further expansion in plant capacity.</p>
<p>Q. How has having a production base in India helped Sungrow with its sales, customer acceptance and service quality?</p>
<p>In today’s globalized market, if any company invests in domestic manufacturing, then it reflects the company’s long-term plans. Local manufacturing has helped us to reduce the lead time with better forecasting and production planning, and thereby serving our customers timely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Q. Has Sungrow found it easy to find quality manpower for the plant? How much does the firm have to invest in training?</p>
<p>We acknowledge that developing pool of quality and skilled manpower is always a challenge. It is a foundation for technical innovation &amp; one of the most essential factor in retaining competitiveness in the market and we were fortunate to set this at early stage. We are organizing internal trainings and skill competition programs at regular intervals to improve their skills and make them more efficient and versatile to handle the required job. Not only do such trainings help our employees deliver better on their routine jobs, but it will also support their future career prospects.</p>
<p>Q. Can you give some instances of engagement with the local community for Sungrow? In the region around your factory, or otherwise in India?</p>
<p>Our employees at Sungrow India come from all over the country. So we celebrate all local festivals, birthdays, anniversaries together in Sungrow India as a closely knit family. We also organize an annual family get together to increase our bonding and emotional engagements. We are glad to share that we have minimum attrition rate in last two years since the India factory was set up, as we have created a good learning atmosphere for our employees. We are actively into various CSR activities like organizing free seminars for school / college students, tree plantations etc. to fulfil our commitments as a socially responsible organization.</p>
<p>Q. What is the present product portfolio being made at the factory? Do you have a breakup of the components in terms of domestic sourcing versus imports from China?</p>
<p>We are manufacturing both string and central inverters here in our India factory. We are presently using local components as available in India which meet our quality requirements. The entire supply chain of power electronic components and materials are still at a very nascent stage and evolving in India for the PV inverters. We will increase the local components as the supplier’s base increases and the supply chain becomes robust in due course of time.</p>
<p>Q. How has 2019 been for Sungrow globally? A brief on the company’s future plans.</p>
<p>2019 was a very good year for Sungrow as we achieved 25.4% year on-year increase of our revenue to $1.864 billion. At the end of 2019, we also became the first company in the industry to achieve the record of accumulative installations surpassing 100GW, equivalent to generating about 129,000 GWh of clean electricity per year and eliminating 103 million tons of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Sungrow has a very clear and elaborate strategy to be the leader in the Power Conversion Technology. In line with its mission “Clean power for all”, Sungrow will continue to explore the other avenues in the clean energy sector and invest in future technologies to create competitive product portfolio and comprehensive global service.</p>
<p>Q. Does Sungrow see the rooftop segment expanding faster in India? Do the domestic content requirements for rooftop subsidies help the firm sell more in India?</p>
<p>Rooftop market segment is expanding faster in India with more and more awareness and adoption by the C&amp;I segment. We have also achieved 100% year-on-year growth of our sales for string inverters over last two years consecutively. The subsidy in the Indian rooftop market is mainly driven by the category of the end user and not by domestic content.</p>
<p>Rooftop solar has a tremendous potential to add the capacities in India and scale up. It is right time for the govt to encourage the locally manufactured products to be used for these rooftop solar projects in India. With our local manufacturing unit in India, we would like to contribute to the success of “Make in India” and the growth of solar in India.</p>
<p>Q. Inverters, despite being the ‘brains’ of the solar plant today, take up only 6-8 percent of total costs. Do you see that changing anytime? How do you see the future trend of inverters?”</p>
<p>Inverter is the core of the entire system and acts as a bridge between PV components and grid. Inverters have significant impact on project design, BoS optimization, annual yield and hence are key to sustained ROI. Sungrow being the technology leader, we are working on various innovations to upgrade the inverter technology for better integration with the grid network and smoother optimization of entire system solution. As the solar project sizes are growing bigger and being set up across climatic areas and difficult terrains, the quality of the products, thermally efficient designs for both extreme hot and cold climate, adherence to the stringent requirements for grid stability and seamless integration of large scale battery storages will become more and more critical requirements for inverters.
