<p>Having the No. 1 song in the country hasn&rsquo;t moved 6ix9ine to stop trolling. In fact, it only gave him fuel to ramp up his tactics. During a recent Instagram Live session with DJ Akademiks, 6ix9ine took aim at YK Osiris, prompting the artist to respond.</p>
<p>6ix9ine began trolling YK Osiris towards the end of the session, when Osiris requested to join the Live. &ldquo;Listen Osiris, we all know you not on my level – 1. I don’t wanna give you that amount of clout…Look the only reason I don’t do it to you right now is cuz you believe in God and I like you cuz of that,&rdquo; he said before running into his studio to mock Osiris’ “Worth It” video. &ldquo;Like if he doesn’t get the song right, she’ll walk out of his life,&rdquo; he added</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave him clout, I gave him streams, people are gonna go listen to this right now and watch his face,&rdquo; 6ix9ine said.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take YK long to respond with a video of his own. &ldquo;Can you get nominated for a Grammy? You gotta stop, my brotha. If you so number one, why you ain’t nominated for a BET Award? If you gon’ talk about being number one, talk about you being happy my ni<strong>a like, like ni</strong>a you still a clown bruh like that don’t make you like 100%. I don’t care bout no Instagram, y’all mind so delusional. I’m never trash, never that and I don’t gotta explain myself coz all y’all do is ride waves.&rdquo;

<h3 id="yk-osiris-drops-leave-me-alone-on-read-highly-anticipated-new-single--visual">&ldquo;YK Osiris Drops “Leave Me Alone On Read” Highly Anticipated New Single + Visual&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://respect-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/unnamed-3.png" alt="img">
, whose RIAA double-platinum signature hit “Worth It” has amassedglobal streams andcombined YouTube views, from his debut album(October 2019), embarks on the path to his next long-player withhis brand new single and video availablevia Def Jam Recordings.</p>
<p>“Leave Me On Read” is the long-awaited follow-up to “Ride” featuring Kehlani ( released in October as well), with over 66 million global streams and over 13 million views, the third single + video from THE GOLDEN CHILD. October found YK segueing from advance sold-out O2 Academy shows in London and Dublin, to a wildly triumphant 11-city U.S. tour.</p>
<p>The meteoric two year rise of YK Osiris began with his signing to Def Jam and the April 2018 debut release of “Valentine” – RIAA gold with over 283 million global streams and over 13 million views to date. “Valentine” led to “Run It Up” and “Timing” in 2018. YK’s streak continued with the 2019 ‘Song Of the Summer’ success of his career-defining “Worth It” and its follow-up, “Freaky Dancer.” Named a VEVO LIFT artist and a VEVO DSCVR artist, YK was subsequently inducted into the prestigious XXL Freshman Class Of 2019.</p>
<p>Born in Jacksonville, FL, Osiris Williams, who turned 21 on September 7th, was savvy at a very young age about the strength of his voice, and understood how to use social media to blow up. “I knew my voice was very power­ful and you can relate to it,” he says. “You be like, ‘Damn, I could feel him. I could feel his pain.’ What I went through. My veins be pop­ping out. You can just see me and my expres­sion.” But Jax was far from the creative hub of South Florida’s rap scene. “We don’t have a lot of resources,” he says. “We don’t have the biggest studios. We don’t have the biggest DJs. We had to make it on our own. I made it, and I got out of it.”</p>
<p>Currently gaining an average of 30,000 social media followers per week, YK Osiris boasts over 1.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 310 million channel views, over 2.6 million Instagram followers, over 769,000 Spotify followers, and over 87,000 Twitter fans. The sky’s the limit for this Young King.

<h3 id="drake-responds-after-yk-osiris-says-he-wants-to-box">&ldquo;Drake Responds After YK Osiris Says He Wants to Box&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/wnldqerkiwrmofmb6gy4/drake-grammy-awards" alt="img">
In what was perhaps an excellent example of confidence going to his head, YK Osiris hopped into Drake&rsquo;s DMs to let him know he was trying to square off in a boxing ring (or, backyard, whichever). This came after Osiris had already faced Lil Tjay, Blueface, and more in similar bouts.</p>
<p>No offense intended for that group at all, but this would represent a significant step up in the profile of his opponent&hellip;which is to say nothing of all those videos you can pull up on Google where Drake&rsquo;s sparring or wailing on a heavy bag.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s how that challenge went down: YK told him &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trynna box u now,&rdquo; but quickly pointed out the offer wasn&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jp u gonna beat df out of me,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>In response, Drake told him &ldquo;Least u know your limits,&rdquo; which was punctuated with several laughing-so-hard-I&rsquo;m-crying emojis.</p>
<p>As pointed out by HotNewHipHop, Drake has previously shouted out Osiris, which is why his DMs get responded to amongst the millions that are undoubtedly just sitting there unread.</p>
<p>In previous news of the rappers boxing each other variety, after YK Osiris and Lil Tjay faced off, 6ix9ine trash talked Tjay, which prompted an exchange that was decidedly less friendly than the one you just read about:</p>
<p>Also YK was supposed to fight Trippie Redd, just a day after Lil Tjay (all the way back on May 29) but that got called off just a few hours before because, as Trippie put it: “It was gon’ be a fight, right? Now it’s not gon’ be a fight. I tried to tell y’all I don’t want to associate myself with bullshit, and y’all try to associate me with bullshit. I don’t get why ’cause I’m a real n***a and I don’t won’t to be part of nothing that has to do with anything that I don’t like. You know what I’m saying? So there was gonna be a fight, now there’s no fight. Sorry, ruined it. Crazy.”

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Reginae-Carter.jpg" alt="img">
Though Reginae Carter and YFN Lucci are no longer together, that’s not stopping the rapper from commenting about people who are showing interest in her now. Fellow rapper YK Osiris has been avidly talking about his feelings for Carter on social media, but both she and Lucci are shutting it down.</p>
<p>Reginae Carter in 2017 | Prince Williams/WireImage</p>
<p>Reginae Carter and YFN Lucci dated for some time</p>
<p>Carter and YFN Lucci were romantically linked for a couple of years. The relationship received a lot of attention not only because Carter is the daughter of Lil Wayne, but because there was a big age difference between the two. YFN Lucci also has multiple children, which was a cause for concern for fans</p>
<p>They reportedly broke up in August of 2019, though rumors still ran rampant that they were on-and-off for months. It was officially confirmed by Carter on her series, T.I. and Tiny: The Friends and Family Hustle.</p>
<p>She spoke about the split on the show. “To hear my daddy tell me that Lucci, he loves you probably, but he’s not in love with you because of the actions and the things that he’s doing,” she said. “My father told me that sometimes when people don’t know love themselves, they can’t love other people, and you can’t blame them for that. Sometimes people just don’t know how to love. Lil Wayne! He made the song! ‘How to Love.’”</p>
<p>Now that she’s single YK Osiris “shoots his shot” at Reginae Carter</p>
<p>Earlier this month, YK Osiris tweeted a video that he was outside of Carter’s house. He wrote, “BAE ‘WYA’. I’m outside your house stop leaving me on read!! Please I’m the man with the plan @reginae_carter1 !! !! !! !!”</p>
<p>Carter responded to him and accused him of using her to promote his new song. She said, “Broooo stop playing with me to try and promote your song! “You are not the one for me doing that my guy.” She later tweeted, “What is wrong with this little boy ?” All tweets from both were deleted, but Osiris decided to tweet a video again with a different caption which said, “I’m tired of her leaving me on read !! !! !! !!”</p>
<p>I’m tired of her leaving me on read ‼️‼️‼️‼️ pic.twitter.com/T3sFU8cdab — YK Osiris (@ykOsiris) June 4, 2020</p>
<p>RELATED: Reginae Carter Isn’t a Fan of Her Time on ‘Growing up Hip Hop’</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that YK Osiris has attempted to “shoot his shot” at Reginae. Last year has publicly said that Carter is his crush, leading many in her Instagram comments to think that he may have sent Carter some flowers for her birthday.</p>
<p>YFN Lucci weights in on the matter</p>
<p>After the tweets, Osiris continued to address Carter in a video. “Reginae, c’mon, just give me a chance. I’m not like these other rappers,” he said. “I’m gon’ give you the world. Stop leaving me on read, baby. Please. I know you tired of the bullcrap, n****s doing dumb junk, but I’m not gon’ do it. Yo’ daddy gon’ like me. I’m gon’ give you the world, baby. Listen, and I’m smart. And I love God.”</p>

<p>However, YFN Lucci stepped in to let Osiris know that the shot that he was shooting wasn’t going to land. “Shot aint nun (BRICK) @ykosiris,” he commented in response to the video.

<h3 id="lil-uzi-vert-i-will-knock-yk-osiris-the-f-out">&ldquo;Lil Uzi Vert: I Will Knock YK Osiris The F*** Out&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lil-Uzi-Vert001.jpg" alt="img">
YK Osiris has been out throwing hands with other artists and Lil Uzi Vert seems to want smoke next. Uzi took to social media on Saturday to let YK Osiris that he wants that same energy he’s been bringing in his other boxing matches.</p>
<p>“I will knock YK Osiris [the f***] out,” Uzi said in the post. The Philadelphia born rapper might be small in stature but his hands are respected. Video on social media shows Uzi putting the pieces on one unidentified opponent.</p>
<p>Of course there was his confrontation with Rich The Kid in Philadelphia where in different videos you see Rich The Kid get snuffed inside a store and another where Rich is literally running from Uzi.</p>
<p>YK Osiris isn’t backing down from the challenge and has been trolling Uzi ever since. “Uzi talked all that bull crap last night, talking about Osiris I’ll knock you out. Man you my son,” Osiris said in an Instagram story.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>YK kept trolling Uzi with no response from the rapper. One thing we know is that neither party is scared of the other. Osiris has already pulled up on two rappers, Desiigner and Blueface.</p>

Oh boy, Tekashi 6ix9ine is running rampant this week after &ldquo;TROLLZ&rdquo; hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100; an accomplishment that 6ix9ine has been longing for before even before his arrest. Over the past few weeks, he&rsquo;s been finding himself in more and more feuds with people but even as he attempts to agitate them, the majority of people are just shrugging it off.</p>
<p>Now, following his recent number one, he took to the &lsquo;Gram to announce that he&rsquo;d be going on a &ldquo;seven-day rant&rdquo; that kicked off earlier today when he called out a slew of rappers. Unfortunately, it extended into this evening when he did an interview with Akademiks about his newly dubbed number one on Instagram Live. For some reason, YK Osiris entered the chat which resulted in a five to six-minute roast session including a full-on imitation of the &ldquo;Worth It&rdquo; singer.</p>
<p>YK Osiris hopped on Instagram Live to respond which was the second mistake he made after initially getting involved. &ldquo;Can you be happy with a number one? Can you be happy?&rdquo; YK Osiris asked. &ldquo;Can you get nominated for a Grammy? You gotta stop, my brother. If you sold number one, why didn&rsquo;t you get nominated for a BET Award?&rdquo;</p>
<p>YK Osiris&rsquo; entire argument devolved into the harms of social media and the masses being brainwashed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care &lsquo;bout no Instagram because y&rsquo;all mind so delusional&hellip; You think I&rsquo;m trash? Man, y&rsquo;all crazy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After watching 6ix9ine&rsquo;s initial statement and Osiris&rsquo; response, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine who&rsquo;s more delusional. Check both clips out below.
