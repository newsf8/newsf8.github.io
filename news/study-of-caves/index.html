<p>Dating cave art is a key issue for understanding human cognitive development. Knowing whether the ability for abstraction and conveying reality involved in artistic development is unique to Homo sapiens or if it was shared with other species, or simply knowing at what moment these abilities developed, is vital in order to understand the complexity of human evolution.</p>
<p>Currently in Spain, for the most part, when trying to find out the age of artistic expressions in caves, dating is done with U-series dating, using the two elements uranium and thorium in the underlying and overlapping layers of calcite in the paint itself.</p>
<p>However, the timeline this system proposes seems to provide evidence for erroneous ages and an inverse relationship between the concentration of uranium and the apparent ages. In order to test the reliability of this dating method, University of Cordoba professors José Luis Sanchidrián Torti and María Ángeles Medina Alcaide performed a study in which they analyzed the reliability of Uranium-thorium dating— and now refute Neanderthals being the creators of the Paleolithic art in Spanish caves via the Nerja Cave. The key, according to the team, seems to be in the mobility of uranium, which would have assigned older (and inaccurate) ages to the cave art in some Spanish caves, ascribing the art to Homo neanderthalensis.</p>
<p>The research team analyzed several samples of calcite related to the chronometric test of a set of rocks in the Nerja Cave, obtaining proof of the complexity of the dating on calcite for the study of the chronology of cave art. In this way, they directly question the generally accepted conclusions to date about the artistic manifestations in several caves being the work of Neanderthals, which had been determined based solely on the Uranium-thorium dating method.</p>
<p>In order to reconstruct the timeline of the history of cave art, Sanchidrián and Medina&rsquo;s research proposes an action protocol for dating Paleolithic art samples that uses data from three measuring systems: Uranium-thorium testing, Carbon 14 (C14) testing and a second mineralogical study of the sample before dating.</p>
<p>It is essential to study in more detail the evolution of these artistic manifestations in order to establish a rigorous and reliable chronological framework that allows us to understand and comprehend human artistic development.</p>

news, local-news,</p>
<p>It may have taken him 67 years, but Gunns Plains&rsquo; Geoff Deer has made the most of one of the toughest seasons on record for tourism by taking himself off to university. Online, that is. Mr Deer and his wife Trish run tours through the iconic Gunns Plains Caves - or did, before the tourism industry was crushed by the weight of a pandemic. &ldquo;We just reopened this week,&rdquo; Mr Deer said. &ldquo;I love it &hellip; Normally this is our slow season, hopefully we get a decent period in June.&rdquo; Mr Deer said the couple had kept busy during the enforced down time by clearing up the site, performing much needed maintenance and spontaneously signing up for university courses. In support of tourism operators across the state, the University of Tasmania has offered a free Graduate Certificate in Tourism for people a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or relevant experience. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always happy to do something if it&rsquo;s free,&rdquo; Mr Deer laughed. &ldquo;Our son&rsquo;s in Year 12, I might be able to give him a nudge while we study next year &hellip; he&rsquo;ll love that.&rdquo; Mr Deer said the hit of missing some of the peak season had been hard for the small business, but slightly cushioned by a bustling summer period. &ldquo;We missed out on a few cruise ships &hellip; each ship would be upwards of $2000 for us,&rdquo; he said. He said the two had been running the business since the early 2000s.

<h3 id="caves-tell-us-that-australias-mountains-are-still-growing-buchan-caves-unlock-technique-for-measuring-uplift-of-mountains">&ldquo;Caves tell us that Australia&rsquo;s mountains are still growing: Buchan Caves unlock technique for measuring uplift of mountains&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Australia has often been unfairly portrayed as an old and idle continent with little geological activity, but new research suggests that we remain geologically active and that some of our mountains are still growing.</p>
<p>The University of Melbourne study reveals that parts of the Eastern Highlands of Victoria, including popular skiing destinations such as Mt Baw Baw and Mt Buller, may be as young as five million years, not 90 million years as originally thought.</p>
<p>John Engel is one of four scientists from the Isotope Geochemistry Group in the School of Earth Sciences who studied the stalagmites, stalactites, and flowstones &ndash; technically called &lsquo;speleothems&rsquo; &ndash; in the nearby Buchan Caves to produce the findings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least 250 meters of additional height in the East Victorian Highlands appears to have been gained in the last few million years,&rdquo; Mr Engel said.</p>
<p>With the help of Parks Victoria Rangers, the team visited 10 caves, climbing down through the passages and crawling through tight squeezes to collect small fragments of speleothem &lsquo;rubble&rsquo; to take back to the lab to determine their age, using radiometric U-Pb dating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research shows a clear trend between oldest speleothem (cave age) and height in the landscape,&rdquo; Mr Engel said. &ldquo;The data suggests that the Buchan region has been steadily uplifting at a rate of 76 meters every million years, beginning at least 3.5 million years ago and continuing today. This means that some speleothems have been sitting in dark caves undisturbed for 3.5 million years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidence suggests the Highlands originally rose up about 90 million years ago when the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand opened up.</p>
<p>Researchers say the cause of the more recent uplift is debated but a leading theory points to the friendly rivalry with New Zealand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Australian and Pacific plates share a common boundary and many of the forces involved at this boundary may be propagated into the Australian plate as tectonic stress. Some of this tectonically-induced stress is then released as uplift of the mountains in South East Australia,&rdquo; Mr Engel said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is why East Gippsland may still feel effects related to these tectonic forces. This subtle modification of classical plate tectonic theory can help explain the frequent, small earthquakes observed along South East Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Engel said while mountains like the Himalaya and the Swiss Alps are admired for their aesthetic appeal, uncovering the secret stories surrounding when and how mountains form provides a layer of appreciation as well as an active field of research for geologists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research showcases a new &ndash; and rather unique &ndash; method for measuring the uplift of mountains. This technique of using speleothem is likely to also work in other caves across the world for regions with &lsquo;recent&rsquo; tectonic activity, offering geologists great opportunities to share more stories about these impressive and unchanging features of our landscape.&rdquo;

Australia is typically portrayed as an old and docile continent with little to no geological activity, but new research shows the isolated land of kangaroos remains geologically active — with several mountains still jutting up into the sky, according to a study from the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>RELATED: PAMUKKALE: AMAZING AND POETIC GEOLOGICAL WONDER IN TURKEY</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s mountains are growing strong</p>
<p>The study shows how parts of the Eastern Highlands of Victoria — which includes popular skiing venues like Mount Buller and Mount Baw Baw — might be only five million years old, instead of 90 million years as previously thought.</p>
<p>John Engel — one of the four scientists at the Isotope Geochemistry Group in the School of Earth Sciences who studied stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstones in the area — went spelunking in the nearby Buchan Caves to develop their findings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least 250 meters of additional height in the East Victorian Highlands appears to have been gained in the last few million years,&rdquo; said Mr. Engel.</p>
<p>With help from Parks Victoria Rangers the team worked in 10 caves, and climbed down through ominous passages so tight they had to crawl and even squeeze through to collect the small fragments of speleothem &ldquo;rubble&rdquo; to bring to the laboratory. Once retrieved, the cave rubble was examined with radiometric U-Pb dating to establish geologic age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research shows a clear trend between oldest speleothem (cave age) and height in the landscape,&rdquo; said Engel. &ldquo;The data suggests that the Buchan region has been steadily uplifting at a rate of 76 meters (roughly 250 feet) every million years, beginning at least 3.5 million years ago and continuing today. This means that some speleothems have been sitting in dark caves undisturbed for 3.5 million years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young geology in East Victoria Highlands</p>
<p>Evidence from the echoing caves suggests these Highlands initially rose from sea level roughly 90 million years ago — when the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia opened.</p>
<p>Researchers think the cause of the more recent rise in mountain height is still debated, but a prime theory signals a friendly rivalry between New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Australian and Pacific plates share a common boundary and many of the forces involved at this boundary may be propagated into the Australian plate as tectonic stress. Some of this tectonically-induced stress is then released as uplift of the mountains in South East Australia,&rdquo; added Engel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is why East Gippsland may still feel effects related to these tectonic forces. This subtle modification of classical plate tectonic theory can help explain the frequent, small earthquakes observed along South East Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unearthing the history of mountain creation</p>
<p>Engel noted that while familiar mountains like the Himalaya and the Swiss Alps are beloved for their looks, unearthing the hidden stories surrounding how and when mountains come into being gives a deeper insight and sense of appreciation for something highly researched in the scientific field of geology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research showcases a new — and rather unique — method for measuring the uplift of mountains. This technique of using speleothem is likely to also work in other caves across the world for regions with &lsquo;recent&rsquo; tectonic activity, offering geologists great opportunities to share more stories about these impressive and unchanging features of our landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continents like Australia and Antarctica are typically treated like quiet, idle geological sites — but with active volcanoes in the latter, and the recent discovery in the caves of Australia, we&rsquo;re learning that no matter where on Earth we go, the ground beneath our feet a short drop away from a wild shifting world of active tectonics.

<p>Australia has often been unfairly portrayed as an old and idle continent with little geological activity, but new research suggests that we remain geologically active and that some of our mountains are still growing.</p>
<p>The University of Melbourne study reveals that parts of the Eastern Highlands of Victoria, including popular skiing destinations such as Mt Baw Baw and Mt Buller, may be as young as five million years, not 90 million years as originally thought.</p>
<p>John Engel is one of four scientists from the Isotope Geochemistry Group in the School of Earth Sciences who studied the stalagmites, stalactites, and flowstones—technically called &lsquo;speleothems&rsquo; – in the nearby Buchan Caves to produce the findings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least 250 meters of additional height in the East Victorian Highlands appears to have been gained in the last few million years,&rdquo; Mr Engel said.</p>
<p>With the help of Parks Victoria Rangers, the team visited 10 caves, climbing down through the passages and crawling through tight squeezes to collect small fragments of speleothem &lsquo;rubble&rsquo; to take back to the lab to determine their age, using radiometric U-Pb dating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research shows a clear trend between oldest speleothem (cave age) and height in the landscape,&rdquo; Mr Engel said. &ldquo;The data suggests that the Buchan region has been steadily uplifting at a rate of 76 meters every million years, beginning at least 3.5 million years ago and continuing today. This means that some speleothems have been sitting in dark caves undisturbed for 3.5 million years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidence suggests the Highlands originally rose up about 90 million years ago when the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand opened up.</p>
<p>Researchers say the cause of the more recent uplift is debated but a leading theory points to the friendly rivalry with New Zealand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Australian and Pacific plates share a common boundary and many of the forces involved at this boundary may be propagated into the Australian plate as tectonic stress. Some of this tectonically-induced stress is then released as uplift of the mountains in South East Australia,&rdquo; Mr Engel said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is why East Gippsland may still feel effects related to these tectonic forces. This subtle modification of classical plate tectonic theory can help explain the frequent, small earthquakes observed along South East Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Engel said while mountains like the Himalaya and the Swiss Alps are admired for their aesthetic appeal, uncovering the secret stories surrounding when and how mountains form provides a layer of appreciation as well as an active field of research for geologists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research showcases a new—and rather unique—method for measuring the uplift of mountains. This technique of using speleothem is likely to also work in other caves across the world for regions with &lsquo;recent&rsquo; tectonic activity, offering geologists great opportunities to share more stories about these impressive and unchanging features of our landscape.&rdquo;</p>
