<p>The move towards hydrogen as a viable vehicle power source has been long and slow, but a big milestone has been ticked off with the arrival of 20 Hyundai Nexo fuel cell vehicles in Canberra.</p>
<p>The fleet will serve the Australian Capital Territory Government and be helped by the arrival of Australia’s first publicly-available hydrogen refuelling station in Canberra in a few months time.</p>
<p>The Nexo is the first hydrogen-powered vehicle to meet Australian Design Rules regulations, with the fleet being the first time any Australian government has used of hydrogen vehicles.</p>
<p>A futuristic-looking SUV, the Nexo has a 666km range and takes three-to-five minutes to refuel.</p>

<p>It has a five-star ANCAP crash safety rating and autonomous driving capabilities including smart driving assistance systems.</p>
<p>Hydrogen technology has been around for decades and has top-notch environmental credentials.</p>
<p>Fuel cell vehicles emit only water vapor and also offer the sam enear-silent driving as plug-in EVs.</p>
<p>However it has never caught on at a large scale due to issues with the gas’ production, transportation, storage and infrastructure requirements.</p>
<p>Its uptake has been especially glacial-paced when compared to the rapidly developing world of hybrids and electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Hyundai has two electric vehicles on the market in the Ioniq and Kona EVs.</p>
<p>But things are progressing on the hydrogen front, even if at a rather glacial pace.</p>
<p>Late last year, the Council of Australian Governments unanimously endorsed Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy which acknowledges the important role hydrogen mobility can play in establishing Australia at the forefront of the global hydrogen industry by 2030.</p>

<p>Hyundai has had a private hydrogen fuelling station available to all car brands at its Sydney headquarters since 2015, when it introduced the Nexo’s ancestor, an ix35 Fuel Cell.</p>
<p>Hydrogen refuelling stations in Brisbane and Melbourne are expected to be completed by the end of this year, with stations also planned for Western Australia, NSW, South Australia and Tasmania.</p>
<p>Hyundai Australia chief executive Jun Heo conceded hydrogen mobility is not yet a mainstream alternative in Australia, but claimed the company was committed to helping the technology play a key role in lowering CO2 levels in the future.</p>
<p>“For a long time, hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future,” Mr Heo said.</p>
<p>“However, with the arrival of a fleet of Nexo FCEVs for the Australian Capital Territory government, we’re pleased to say that it’s now the fuel of today.</p>
<p>“Nexo is the embodiment of our long-term commitment to introducing hydrogen-powered transport in Australia and around the world.”

<h3 id="hyundai-australia-lands-first-20-hydrogen-powered-nexo-suvs-for-act-fleet">&ldquo;Hyundai Australia lands first 20 hydrogen-powered Nexo SUVs for ACT fleet&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HyundaiNEXOFCEV-15.jpg" alt="img">
Hyundai Australia has announced its first 20 Nexo SUVs have arrived in Australia, ready for deployment in the ACT where they will provide a zero tailpipe emissions fleet across several departments.</p>
<p>Powered by hydrogen, is the first fuel cell vehicle (FCEV) certified for sale in Australia, and offers the advantage of a long 666km driving range and the ability to refuel in just minutes much like fossil fuels.</p>
<p>While the production of truly “green” zero emissions hydrogen in a manner that does not require a high share of clean energy, is still being addressed (recent studies at the ANU and USQ show some promise but are far from commercialisation), a hydrogen refuelling station pilot was announced for the ACT in 2019 in readiness for the 20 Nexos.</p>
<p>The Hyundai Nexo has a 5-star ANCAP safety rating and will help the ACT government fulfil its goal to reach 100% zero emissions from transport by 2021, part of a broader plan to reduce its carbon emissions to zero – a part of which it reached ahead of schedule in 2019 when it achieved 100% energy from renewable resources.</p>
<p>This station will be opened in the third quarter of 2020, says Hyundai, and as Australia’s first publicly available hydrogen refuelling station is being installed by French renewable energy company Neoen as part of its deal to provide the ACT with power from its three wind farms at Hornsdale in South Australia.</p>
<p>“For a long time, hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future. However, with the arrival of a fleet of Nexo FCEVs for the Australian Capital Territory Government, we’re pleased to say that it’s now the fuel of today,” Hyundai Australia CEO Jun Heo said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Nexo is the embodiment of our long-term commitment to introducing hydrogen-powered transport in Australia and around the world,” said Heo.</p>
<p>The Hyundai Nexo joins a range of electric and hybrid vehicles also introduced to Australia by the South Korean car maker over the past 18 months, including the Ioniq fastback (which is available in electric, plug-in hybrid and non-pluggable hybrid), and the Kona Electric.</p>
<p>“As part of a line-up that includes hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure electric models, Nexo underscores our leadership in eco-mobility and our commitment to a sustainable, low-emissions motoring future in this country,” says Heo.</p>
<p>While hydrogen fuel cell technology is touted as a better alternative for long-haul and heavy duty vehicles, it is also commercially available overseas in the Toyota Mirai, a handful of which have been trialled through Melbourne’s Hobson Bay City Council.</p>
<p>The Australian Renewable Energy Agency also backed the creation of a hydrogen-refuelling station to be built at the old Toyota Altona car plant, while Hyundai has its own on-site hydrogen fuel station at HMCA headquarters in Sydney to fuel the FCEV ix35.</p>
<p>In more recent news, FCEV startup H2X announced its plan to manufacture an hydrogen-powered SUV named “Snowy” in Port Kembla – but first, it plans to precede this with a range of built-to-order commercial vehicles underpinned by a back-to-base refuelling station to suit customer requirements.</p>
<p>US hydrogen startup Nikola also made news in recent weeks when it announced its “Badger” FCEV ute, sending share prices sky high and valuing Nikola’s market cap above that of US car giant Ford.

<p><img src="https://www.h2-mobile.fr/img/post-h2/hyundai-nexo-zurich-01_040620.jpg" alt="img">
Pour la police de Zurich, l’expérimentation de cette voiture à hydrogène marque une nouvelle étape d’une stratégie engagée dès 2003 pour verdir sa flotte de véhicules. Si près de 18 % des quelque 600 véhicules de la police zurichoise sont déjà dotés d’une technologie à propulsion alternative, l’expérimentation de ce SUV à hydrogène est une première.Destiné aux missions de patrouille, il sera expérimenté sur 300.000 kilomètres. Pour couvrir les besoins de sa mission, il est équipéd’une signalétique spéciale (barres de toit), d’un dispositif de contrôle de la distance parcourue, d’une boîte noire, d’un système de localisation en liaison permanente avec la centrale d’intervention, d’une radio et de différents équipements de signalisation.La police de Zurich n’est d’ailleurs pas la seule à recourir au SUV à hydrogène coréen. Depuis plus de six mois, le gouvernement zurichois expérimente lui aussi deux exemplaires du Hyundai Nexo.

<h3 id="is-hydrogen-the-future-of-australian-motoring-toyota-hyundai-and-h2x-think-it-could-be">&ldquo;Is hydrogen the future of Australian motoring? Toyota, Hyundai and H2X think it could be&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://carsguide-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,t_default/v1/editorial/HyundaiNEXOFCEV-15.jpg" alt="img">
Hydrogen or electric? It’s the question that dominates all discussion about the future of driving.</p>
<p>But it’s already been answered, even if we didn’t realise it yet, because both have a place.</p>
<p>Hydrogen may be less advanced at this stage, but recent events have demonstrated that it’s set to play a major role in the future of transport in Australia, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Electric cars are here now and increasing in popularity, just look at the latest sales figures that show double- and even triple-digit growth for battery-powered cars. However, hydrogen is set to catch up as more and more money is poured into developing both vehicles that run on it, as well as cleaner, more efficient ways to produce it as a fuel.</p>
<p>Start-up H2X recently announced plans to begin producing a range of hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV), including an SUV dubbed Snowy, at a plant in Port Kembla south of Sydney. It would be a major boost for both hydrogen and local manufacturing if it comes off, paving the way for more FCEV to come.</p>
<p>Major players are big believers</p>
<p>H2X may be a small player in the automotive market, but there are several big-name brands that are investing heavily in FCEV, most significantly Toyota and Hyundai.</p>
<p>Toyota has been promoting its Mirai FCEV sedan locally for several years, while Hyundai has deals in place with the ACT government to operate a fleet of its Nexo SUVs.</p>
<p>Earlier this week 20 examples of Hyundai’s FCEV SUV arrived in Australia for delivery to the ACT government, marking a major step forward for hydrogen vehicles in this country.</p>
<p>The benefit of FCEV is the fact they can be refuelled with pressurised hydrogen almost as quickly as filling up a petrol or diesel car.</p>
<p>Despite the advances in rapid charging stations for EVs, in theory FCEV will be consistently faster to refuel and allow owners to make longer journeys between stops, which could be a big advantage in a country like Australia with vast distances between major centres.</p>
<p>As part of Hyundai’s deal with the ACT government a new hydrogen refuelling station will be built in Canberra that will become the first publicly-available one of its kind in Australia. Currently one of the only places to refuel a FCEV is at Hyundai’s head office in Sydney, which isn’t open to the public but the company has allowed any other manufacturer experimenting with FCEV to use it.</p>
<p>Hyundai claims that by the end of 2020 there will be public refuelling stations in Brisbane and Melbourne with plans for more in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.</p>
<p>Toyota has also built its own mobile refuelling station to tour the country with its first-generation Mirai, while the Japanese car brand has already shown off the next-gen model in concept form ahead of an expected global market introduction later this year.</p>
<p>Commercial applications</p>
<p>While it’s cars like the Mirai and Nexo that are attracting most of the attention at the moment, the key to hydrogen’s growth could be with commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Fuel cells are becoming increasingly popular amongst truck and bus operators because it provides significant range and refuelling benefits compared to electric powertrains.</p>
<p>The Snowy may be the headline attraction for H2X, but the brand will also produce a pair of heavy vehicles to form the foundation of its Australian operations.</p>
<p>And H2X isn’t the only one either, with Hyzon Motors announcing in May that it’s aiming to set up business in Australia building fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles, likely buses and trucks, by 2022.</p>
<p>These major fleets will help establish the refuelling infrastructure, initially they will likely be private operations for specific companies, but it’s seen by experts in the industry as a key step on the way to a wider public network of stations.</p>
<p>And could a FCEV ute be far off? Nikola has already confirmed its Badger ute will be arriving Down Under in 2022, and could be positioned as a hydrogen-powered alternative to the likes of the Tesla Cybertruck and Rivian R1T.</p>
<p>LPG of the future</p>
<p>Another reason for hydrogen’s future potential is the prospective for job creation and fuel independence it can bring. Government, and private investment, is searching for new and better ways to make hydrogen - either through natural gas or from water using renewable power - in a bid to fulfill the expected demand by the middle of this decade.</p>
<p>The CSIRO and private firms, including Woodside Energy, are trying to stimulate hydrogen production which could help create a new fuel sector, much like LPG did previously.</p>
<p>The CSIRO’s National Hydrogen Roadmap makes the benefits of hydrogen in transport clear, stating: “In the passenger vehicle market, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) represent a potentially more favourable option (compared with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for consumers that travel longer distances (i.e. 400-600km without refuelling) and expect shorter refuelling times. For heavier vehicles such as buses and trucks with stringent payloads, the relative weight of hydrogen (compared with batteries) also allows for greater distances travelled without the need for refuelling.”</p>
<p>Read More: Hydrogen FCEVs take another step towards viability in Australia</p>
<p>However, it does concede that the technology does face the barrier of a lack of fuelling stations, and the high cost of installing them - up to $2 million. But the collaboration between vehicle manufacturers and governments - such as Hyundai’s partnership with the ACT Government - as well as the advances in the stations in more mature overseas markets, such as German and the USA, could mean a shortcut for Australia.</p>
<p>According to the CSIRO Roadmap: “Australia has the benefit of rolling out station models that have already been developed overseas. If a series of demonstration projects were to be implemented in the next 5 years, these stations could be commonplace by 2025.”

<h3 id="hyundai-unveils-2021-santa-fe-large-suv">&ldquo;Hyundai unveils 2021 Santa Fe large SUV&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/whichcar/2020/06/03/118786/Santa_Fe_main-(1).jpg" alt="img">
Hyundai has followed up on its tantalising teaser image of the forthcoming 2021 Santa Fe last month, with a full reveal of the next-generation large SUV.</p>
<p>Little extra information accompanies the handful of images and confirmation the almost completely new model will arrive in Australia before the end of the year, but there are a few morsels to be gleaned.</p>
<p>Read next: Another big Hyundai SUV is coming this year</p>
<p>What Hyundai describes as &lsquo;revised&rsquo; is actually a Santa Fe that rolls on a new platform and has grown inside and out, and is the most off-road focused generation in the model&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Glance inside its cabin and you&rsquo;ll find a new Terrain Mode selector for choosing a number of drive modes programmed into the HTRAC all-wheel drive system, optimising traction on a range of loose surfaces.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a new 10.3-inch central touchscreen that forms the centrepiece of the significantly revised cabin, while on the outside there are striking 20-inch wheels.</p>
<p>The big hoops are likely to be an option at the higher end of the range, which is still yet to be detailed, along with at least two exterior styling packages.</p>
<p>The images in our gallery may appear to be of the same Santa Fe but look closer and you&rsquo;ll pick out subtle differences between two specification levels.</p>
<p>While one version has plastic arches, chunkier grille mesh and taller tyres, presumably with a more off-road leaning stance, the other has body-coloured arches, fine mesh and the full-fat 20s. That&rsquo;s your city slicker.</p>

<p>“We modernised the new Santa Fe with premium features and appealing aesthetics that are sure to add value,” said senior vice president and head of Global Design Centre SangYup Lee.</p>
<p>“The bold lines that extend from one side to the other and from front to back give Santa Fe a rugged yet refined look that SUV customers want. Besides, we’ve added numerous features and functions to create a truly family-focused SUV that is a pleasure to drive.”</p>
<p>Original story published May 2020</p>
<p>Hyundai appears to be tearing up the traditional model lifecycle template with a new version of the company’s Santa Fe large SUV apparently just around the corner - less than three years after the current-generation was launched.</p>
<p>The fourth-generation of Hyundai’s popular SUV made its global debut early in 2018 and arrived in Australian showrooms in July of the same year, but a single teaser image released by the South Korean car maker today is heralding the arrival of a fifth-gen model.</p>
<p>A full reveal of the car along with the all-important details is yet to be slated but you’ll be seeing the smartest version of Hyundai’s large SUV to date rolling on Australian roads before 2020 is out.</p>
<p>Its arrival will be unusually early for any new car, regardless of the brand, with most passenger and SUV models replaced approximately every five or six years at the minimum. In its third iteration (DM), for example, the Santa Fe hung around for nearly seven years.</p>
<p>Even for a mid-life update, this development in the Santa Fe’s evolution could be considered premature, although the single image of its nose revealed today appears to suggest a major redesign and something more than a light refresh.</p>
<p>Update or new, you decide</p>
<p>While Hyundai regards the new Santa Fe as a ‘revision’ of the current model (and may even retain the existing TM model code), WhichCar has learnt that it will be bigger inside and out, and employs a different platform, suggesting a dramatic redesign.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the fourth-gen’s short innings could be to make way for electrification.</p>
<p>The company has already made clear its intention to progressively introduce more electrified vehicles with 16 new offerings expected by 2025.</p>
<p>Models including the Kona and Ioniq roll on platforms specifically designed to support hybrid and pure electric drivetrains, but the existing Santa Fe’s architecture is limited to combustion power until a new version arrives.</p>
<p>No technical information has been revealed with today’s single teaser image, but you can bet your last dollar a new Santa Fe platform will designed with electric motors in mind.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the new model could even represent Hyundai’s second hydrogen-powered SUV in the current range, delivering a bigger sibling for the Nexo mid-sized, fuel cell-powered SUV.</p>
<p>Hyundai Nexo pictured</p>
<p>The current-generation Santa Fe certainly isn’t loosing any momentum in the sales race and ranks comfortably in Australia’s top five favourite large SUVs. It’s possible therefore, that the new model could be sold alongside its predecessor for a period of overlap.</p>
<p>Extra SUV</p>
<p>Whatever form the new Santa Fe takes, it won’t be the only big Hyundai to make its debut this year with the even bigger Palisade also arriving in Australia before the end of 2020.</p>
<p>When it touches down, the Palisade will form the new flagship of Hyundai’s line-up locally, with a large SUV that will give the Toyota Prado and Mazda CX-9 something to worry about with room for up to eight on board.</p>
<p>Little is given away in the first Santa Fe teaser image other than a new full-width geometric patterned grille, which incorporates new LED daytime running lights - said to reflect the company’s new integrated vehicle architecture.</p>
<p>More images are expected soon along with extra information that will start to unravel some of the ‘technological enhancements’ contained within the new Santa Fe, which Hyundai is describing as ‘the ultimate family adventure vehicle’.
