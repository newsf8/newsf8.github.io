No knowledge of arithmetic is required to enjoy
this. All you need is a logical mind , a pencil and
an eraser. Try it. Suffer its torture. Discover its
ecstasy. It&rsquo;s a mind game you will solve with
reasoning and logic.
The rules are very simple. Fill in the grid with
numbers so that every row, every column and
every small 3x3 box contains the numbers 1 to
9. Each number has its allotted place if you look
hard enough. No number should be repeated in
any row, column or 3x3 box. Every puzzle has
only one correct answer. Here&rsquo;s an easy one to
try - See tomorrow&rsquo;s Island for solution.

Two
years
after
Sixpence None the Richer split,
singer Leigh Nash is pursuing a
solo career, though she can’t
quite escape the band’s hit “Kiss
Me.”
The song has become a sta-
ple during time-outs at sporting
events, with stadium cameras
focusing on fans who are expect-
ed to smooch.
“I heard about that,” Nash
told
The
Associated
Press.
“That’s awesome.
It kind of
makes sense and it was such a
big song. I thought it was cute.
I’m glad they have a song that
was appropriate.”
Nash
performed
a
brief
acoustic set at the JPMorgan
Chase Open women’s tennis
tournament
Friday
night,
singing “Kiss Me”
and new
songs from her debut solo album
“Blue on Blue,” which is due out
Tuesday.
“I’ve played almost every
possible scenario - funerals,
weddings, sports events, you
name it,” she said.
Sixpence dissolved in 2004,
and Nash and her husband
moved to Los Angeles, where
she wrote several songs for the
album and gave birth to her first
child.
“It’s about the song and the
lyrics,” she said. “In Sixpence,
there was a lot going on and I
felt like I was kind of drowned
out all the time. I was having to
fight to get over the instruments
and the guitars.”
Nash’s album is on One Son
Records, her label named for her
2 1/2-year-old son Henry. She
will tour this fall with Jars of
Clay and Matt Wertz.
“If I wasn’t as content and
happy with the record as I am, I
might feel a lot more freaked
out,” she said. “But I stand
behind it and I feel really posi-
tive about it and the work that
was put into it.
‘Kiss Me’
