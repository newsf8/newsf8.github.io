Naina Singh was last seen in Kumkum Bhagya. (Photo: Naina Singh/Instagram)</p>
<p>Young actor Naina Singh, most recently seen as Rhea Mehra, Abhi (Shabir Ahluwalia) and Pragya’s (Sriti Jha) daughter, in ZEE TV’s popular daily soap Kumkum Bhagya, is all set to enter the house of Bigg Boss 14. Naina has reality TV show experience and seems like a strong contender.</p>
<p>Hailing from Moradabad, Naina first won the title of Femina’s Most Stylish Diva in 2013. After this, she participated in the tenth season of MTV dating reality show Splitsvilla X in 2017 and won the show along with Baseer Ali. Later, to make a career in Bollywood, Naina auditioned for Karan Johar-Rohit Shetty judged talent hunt show India’s Next Superstar and ended up being the finalist of the show.</p>
<p>Though she could not bag a role in a Bollywood movie, Naina Singh got noticed in the reality show and was cast in the successful show Kumkum Bhagya. A year later, the young star decided to quit the show since she didn’t like her character graph.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t relate to Rhea at all. The kind of emotions she portrays was not justified, and I couldn’t bring to myself to play the part. I would really get upset thinking about it, and it was affecting me. Her hatred and jealousy had no reason, and I didn’t want my young fans to get the wrong message. This is why I decided to quit. The character was shaping up in all the wrong ways,” Naina told indianexpress.com.</p>
<p>A look at Naina Singh’s social media profile suggests that she is quite glamorous and will definitely up the oomph quotient in the Bigg Boss house.</p>
<p>Check out a few photos and videos of Naina Singh:</p>
<p>Naina will be competing with Jasmin Bhasin, Pavitra Punia, Rubina Dilaik, Nikki Tamboli, Jaan Kumar Sanu, Nishant Singh Malkani, Rahul Vaidya and Eijaz Khan among others in the show. Only time will tell if her experience in Splitsvilla will help her survive in Bigg Boss 14.</p>

<p>There has been much conjecture about the Bigg Boss 14 wild card contestants but a new leaked video shows that television actors Kavita Kaushik and Naina Singh will enter the show this weekend. In a new promo for the upcoming Weekend Ka Vaar episode hosted by Salman Khan, the two are seen battling each other in a fierce dance-off.</p>
<p>Naina makes a smashing entry to the song Babuji Zara Dheere Chalo, dressed in a silver strapless dress. Kavita, too, is seen dancing to the same song. She is seen wearing a white long-sleeved dress with a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit. The song then changes to Laila Main Laila, and the two are seen walking towards each other and busting out competing moves.</p>
<p>Kavita has been in the television industry for nearly two decades and is best remembered for playing Inspector Chandramukhi Chautala in the comedy show FIR. Naina, on the other hand, won the dating reality show Splitsvilla 10 in 2017. She was most recently seen as Rhea Mehra in Kumkum Bhagya but quit the show earlier this year.</p>

<p>According to reports, another wild card contestant is set to enter Bigg Boss 14 with Kavita and Naina. However, Colors has kept the identity of the third contestant under wraps for now.</p>
<p>Bigg Boss 14 has been living up to its theme - ‘ab scene paltega (the scene will change now)’. There have been a number of surprises on the show, from the presence of ‘seniors’ Sidharth Shukla, Hina Khan and Gauahar Khan in the Bigg Boss house to contestants having to fight it out for the ‘confirmed’ status.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the ‘seniors’ exited Bigg Boss 14 after a two-week stint on the show. Two contestants from the show - Sara Gurpal and Shehzad Deol - have been evicted so far.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.easterneye.biz/wp-content/themes/twenty-twenty-child/images/favicon.ico" alt="img">
“HI GUYS! I am Naina Singh and I am more than elated to narrate the top 10 incidents from my professional journey so far. My journey has been a tumultuous rollercoaster ride, which I have had from being a reality show contestant to a successful actress.”</p>
<p>Winning a pageant despite being not so ‘ramp-friendly’: So my career started with Femina’s Most Stylish Diva back in 2013. My mother had sent my photographs for the contest and I got a call that I had been selected. And me, despite being a complete tomboy, went to Mumbai and walked the ramp for the final rounds of auditions. And soon after that, offers for shows started pouring in!</p>
<p>Went for an audition, but bagged the job of a casting director instead: I remember, this one time when I went to audition for a film, and they loved my acting. But on the looks front, I was not fitting the character. So, they told me to join them as a casting director and I happily took the job offer, and started working for them (laughs).</p>
<p>Bagging my first-ever reality show: I went onto audition for one of India’s top reality shows Splitsvilla back in 2017. The show was and is still a big hit. Well, I auditioned, and was selected. I feel lucky to have been a part of the show, which I think gave me a major breakthrough in my career.</p>
<p>Earning the ‘sherni’ tag: While I was in the show (Splitsvilla), my fans had given me the tag of a ‘sherni’ (lioness) for being headstrong and opinionated throughout the duration. This in return gave me a loyal fan base, who supported me throughout my journey.</p>
<p>Winning the reality show, Splitsvilla: And then, I went on to win the show. What a moment that was! Actually, the win came in as a surprise for me because everyone on the show was rigorously fighting for the title and they also had a massive fan following outside.</p>
<p>Bagging my second reality show, India’s Next Superstar: I then went onto participate in a talent search reality show called India’s Next Superstar. It’s a show which gives a platform to budding actors, and I was very excited to be a part of it. This show actually gave me a chance to showcase my acting capabilities.</p>
<p>Rising against the odds and becoming a finalist: I was told by many of my friends that I wouldn’t be selected. And when I did get a call, I was told they wouldn’t be signing the contract with me. And well, when they actually did, all of them were left dumbfounded! Hah!</p>
<p>Getting offered an international show: After being part of these reality shows, my talent got recognised and I got an offer for an international show. But unfortunately, I could not do it due to prior work commitments. But I am really grateful that the makers considered me to be a part of the show, which was an iconic sequel of a huge show.</p>
<p>Making my television debut: I began my journey as Rhea Mehra on the Zee TV show Kum Kum Bhagya. The show itself was very iconic and I was blessed to be a part of it for a stipulated period of time.</p>
<p>Being awarded for the best debut: I bagged an award for my show Kum Kum Bhagya in the best debut category, and I was immensely blessed because usually, an actor doesn’t get so much acceptance and love in their very first project. But I was lucky enough to have been blessed with so much love and appreciation for my very first fictional character.</p>

Image Source : INSTAGRAM/NAINASINGH Bigg Boss 14: Who is Naina Singh? Look at her stunning photos here DO NOT PUBLISH</p>
<p>Bigg Boss 14&ndash; one of the much-awaited reality shows is around the corner and we can&rsquo;t keep calm. The show hosted by Salman Khan is all set to premiere on October 3. And while the excitement level is super high, everyone is eager to know who are the contestants of the popular show. While names of a lot of celebrities are doing rounds on the internet, there is a rumour that Television fame Naina Singh will be entering the house. Various reports claim that after Jasmin Bhasin, Nia Sharma and Pavitra Punia, Naina is the one who has been confirmed by the makers. For those who are unaware who this pretty lady is, let&rsquo;s have a look at her career and stunning pictures.</p>
<p>Naina is not new to reality shows as she has already won the title of Splitsvilla 10 and was even a finalist on Star Plus show India&rsquo;s Next Superstar. After the shows, she landed into acting as she grabbed a crucial role in one of the popular shows of the small screen&ndash;KumKum Bhagya. Naina was seen playing the role of Pragya and Abhi&rsquo;s daughter. However, the journey did not last long as she quit because she was not happy with her role and wanted to try something new.</p>
<p>Naina Singh stepped into showbiz after participating in Miss India 2013. Naina hails from Uttarakhand. She played Abhi (Shabir Ahluwalia) and Pragya&rsquo;s (Sriti Jha) daughter Riya Mehra on Kumkum Bhagya.</p>
<p>Image Source : INSTAGRAM/FANPAGE Naina Singh in KumKum Bhagya</p>
<p>Now it seems that the lady has made up her mind to participate in Salman Khan&rsquo;s show. Speaking to ETimes TV, she neither accepted nor denied her participation in the show. Not only this, she even spoke up about how pre-planned strategies never work in Bigg Boss.</p>
<p>Naina said, &ldquo;When one&rsquo;s outside the Bigg Boss house, they make all kind of assumptions about people, and the situations they might find themselves in. But when they go inside, it&rsquo;s completely different. So pre-planned strategies never work inside the Bigg Boss house. It&rsquo;s never about strategies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about how truthful you are to yourself, and how honestly you want to portray yourself in front of the audience. You can&rsquo;t depend on strategies in the long run. You have no choice but to be real.&rdquo;</p>
