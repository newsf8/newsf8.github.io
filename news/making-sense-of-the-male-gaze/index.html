<p>Irrespective of cultures, male gaze exists everywhere. But how women make sense of it differs depending on their age, experience and physical status. Here’s some interesting insights:</p>
<p>It was Ira Singhal who got me thinking about the male gaze last year. The 2015 batch UPSC topper was making headlines then and over a leisurely three-hour interview – more like chat – for a story, she shared perspective about her life and the journey.</p>
<p>By any yardstick, Singhal has had an impressive journey. She suffers from scoliosis or curvature of the spine. With a hunched back, very short stature and a delicate construct, she walks with an awkward gait. But dare you pity her. She exudes confidence like hell. A topper throughout and a brilliant student, throughout her school she was that bright, well-behaved, almost-perfect girl that other parents wanted their children to emulate. So despite her disability, she said she had a very normal and almost perfect childhood.</p>
<p>But there was something i wanted to ask her. And i did. Despite the normal childhood, didn’t she miss something? With physical disabilities, what was growing up like for a teenaged girl when attention from the opposite sex is so important? Singhal was candid. She said she figured out early in life that that was a track she had no future. And with that brutal acceptance, she said, life became easier for her. An age when girls rivalled each other competing for boys’ attention, she was everybody’s best friend and confidant who was not in the race and hence not a threat to anyone.</p>
<p>But there was another kind of gaze that unsettled her. She would walk on the street and strangers would stare at her. Her odd physical construct would draw gaze of a very different kind. But soon she learnt how to deal with that too. Often just a ‘hi’ or a ‘good morning’ with a smile – even to a stranger – would disarm or unsettle them.</p>
<p>Irrespective of cultures and societies, most women have experienced the male gaze at different points of time, in different contexts and at multiple levels. I thought about Singhal and reflected on my experience with the male gaze as i read few pieces analysing the male gaze early this week.</p>
<p>There’s a piece that Jennifer Bartlett wrote for NYTimes. Bartlett has cerebral palsy. She recalls how in her early 30s she would walk with two friends for their yoga class to a studio in New York. Sometimes they would reach there separately. Her friends would often complain about being harassed or catcalled by construction workers on their way. But Bartlett would often pass that site without any incident. “I was never hit on or sexually harassed by my professors in college, or later, by my co-workers or superiors,” she says in her piece. “I watch men on the street. I will watch a man visually or verbally harass women who pass him. I am invisible enough to do this. Sometimes men look at me, but the reaction is different…. does this mean that I am lucky?…It certainly does not feel that way.”</p>
<p>Bartlett gets the attention in other difficult ways. “On one hand, I know that I am “lucky” not to be sexually harassed…..But I am harassed in other ways that feel much more damaging. People stare….People feel most comfortable speaking about me in the third person rather than addressing me directly. It is not uncommon that I will be in a situation where a stranger will talk to the nearest able-bodied person, whether it be a friend or a complete stranger, about me to avoid speaking to me.”</p>
<p>But here’s what really caught my attention and pushed me to think deeper about the male gaze. She says she understands what it feels like getting the attention from the wrong man. “Its gross,” she says. But then she adds: “But I still would much rather have a man make an inappropriate sexual comment than be referred to in the third person…”</p>
<p>However, Emily Sullivan Sanford offers a counter view in her piece. Sanford was born with achondroplasia, a type of dwarfism. As a teenager she was once asked by a reporter on national television: “So do you think the fact that you haven’t had a boyfriend yet is because of your dwarfism?” In her piece she weighs in on the male gaze and says: “Being told you’re beautiful can feel fantastic. I’ve heard it from both lovers and strangers on the street. But the street version is at best a cheap high compared to the profound and lasting joy generated by someone who’s come to love you more the more they’ve gotten to know you….And is the cheap high from strangers worth the fall that will invariably come from being ignored — or insulted — on a day that you look heavier, older or more disabled? Is the possibility of feeling praised worth the risk of feeling threatened?”</p>
<p>Clearly, women with disabilities offer very different spin to how they make sense of the male gaze.</p>
<p>But how do women at large look at it? Jessica Valenti offers a perspective in a piece she wrote last year . She says when she was younger she would get attention, comments and lascivious stares from men. She says in her piece: “It was miserable. But still, as much as I wish it didn’t, the thought of not being worth men’s notice bothers me. To my great shame, I assume I must look particularly good on the rarer days that I do get catcalled.” As she is getting older she is becoming more and more invisible to men. “To my great shame, the thought of not being worth men’s notice bothers me, even though I’m a seasoned feminist and I know better.”</p>
<p>Do men have a view on the man’s gaze? Dustin Hoffman threw some light on it in this 2012 interview to American Film Institute on his performance as a woman in the film “Tootsie”.</p>
<p>He says: “I thought I should be beautiful. If was going to be a woman, I wanted to be as beautiful as possible. And [the makeup artists] said to me, “That’s as good as it gets. That’s as beautiful as we can get ya, Charlie.” And it was at that moment that I had an epiphany. And I went home and started crying. Talking to my wife… I said, “I think that I’m an interesting woman when I look at myself on screen. And I know that if met myself at a party, I would never talk to that character because she doesn’t fulfill physically the demands that we’re brought up to think women have to have for us to ask them out.” She says, “What are you saying?” I said, “There’s too many interesting women I have not had the experience to know in this life because I have been brainwashed.”</p>
<p>As a woman, my experiences with the male gaze has evolved with time. When i was in my pre-teens i was naive and innocent. Careless and carefree, it often didn’t even register. I remember one incident around monsoon. The young playful me (may be around 11-12 years of age), who loved getting drenched in the rain, made excuses for some urgent work at home to just step out and enjoy the rain. Clearly oblivious, i was in my own world splashing water when a man (looked like in his 20s), perhaps watching me from the corner paan shop for some time, began to walk alongside and suddenly wanted to hold my hand. I shrieked and was very scared.</p>
<p>By the time I reached college, things changed. Attention from young men on the campus had a positive spin. It was something to be desired. In my 40s, it is different now. Experience and maturity teaches you well how to turn totally blind or ignore the male gaze one does not desire. Age also brings with it enough confidence to take control of the situation if need be. I recall a cab ride where the driver was staring at me through the rear view mirror at a traffic light. All it took a stern “Kuch problem hai kya” (Do you have any problem?) to deal with it.</p>
<p>What’s your ‘male gaze’ story? Do you have one? Tell us.

<p><img src="https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/large_file_plugin/2020/02/1581569224_ZindagiInShortS.jpg" alt="img">
Zindagi inShort review: Guneet Monga serves a versatile mix of small, delectable shorts in her life-affirming omnibus</p>
<p>Language: Hindi with some English</p>
<p>Guneet Monga has a penchant for telling slice-of-life films that tug hard at your heartstrings — be it the poignant Masaan, the hopeful The Lunchbox, or the incisive Oscar-winning documentary Period: End of a Sentence. With Zindagi inShort, Monga&rsquo;s maiden collaboration with Flipkart Video, she has attempted to present seven separate stories about &ldquo;extraordinary situations in our ordinary lives,&rdquo; as she describes herself. Firmly grounded in reality, these seven stories are connected by a shared feeling of optimism, celebration, and rumination.</p>
<p>Pinni by Tahira Kashyap Khurrana</p>
<p>The anthology begins with Tahira Kashyap Khurrana&rsquo;s short Pinni, which she has crafted with utmost delicateness. This is a story about a neglected woman (Neena Gupta), whose daughter and relatives call her only when they need her to courier them her special handcrafted pinnis (a type of sweet popular in Punjab). Her husband (Shishir Sharma) is never malicious but often fails to regard his wife as a thinking entity. Silently, she seeks refuge into the bountiful, bustling kitchen with its clanking dishes, whistling kettles, and boiling pots. There is also a cheeky observer — the domestic help (played by the effervescent Srishti Shrivastava). Neena&rsquo;s only human interaction is with the help, who does not spare a moment to roll her eyes at Neena&rsquo;s dedication towards her family or belt out a saucy remark at her naivety. But Kashyap&rsquo;s masterstroke to make Neena quiet and shy helps the film from slipping into intense melodrama. Even in her rebellion, it is Neena&rsquo;s dignified quietude that makes the ending so powerful and effective.</p>
<p>Sleeping Partner by Punarvasu Naik</p>
<p>Punarvasu Naik&rsquo;s directorial Sleeping Partner is also about a woman&rsquo;s journey to emancipation. Trapped in a loveless marriage, Beena (Divya Dutta) hopes one day she will be recognised and respected for the woman she is. Her husband (Sanjay Kapoor) addresses her as his &ldquo;sleeping partner,&rdquo; and treats her as a subhuman. Divya, systemically raped and sexually abused by her husband for over two decades, feels emboldened when her husband&rsquo;s colleague Ravish (Jitin Gulati) assures her she &ldquo;deserves love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dutta imbues her character with utmost vulnerability, and Kapoor nails his portrayal of an abusive husband, by making him a spectacularly ordinary man. His gait, and the twitch is his eyebrow is as far from a quintessential antagonist can get — which makes Kapoor so chilling. Despite the superb acting though, one may find Sleeping Partner a tad too melodramatic and Bollywoodised, especially in the end.</p>
<p>Nano So Phobia by Rakesh Sain</p>
<p>Talking about Bollywood, the most un-mainstream ventures in the anthology are the deliciously zany Nano So Phobia and Swaaha, both laced with a wicked sense of humour. While one tells the tale of an old, disheveled woman fighting to cope with the trauma of being robbed by her domestic help, the other captures the plight of a man who has just been informed that his wife has been an infidel.</p>
<p>With Nano So Phobia, director Rakesh Sain poses a commentary on society and its apathy, but without a pinch of sermonising. In fact, Nano So Phobia is so good that it may be even come to define what a model short film should look like.</p>
<p>Sain turns the home invasion genre on his head with a relentlessly wacky narrative, and a supposedly senile septuagenarian (Swaroop Sampat) at the centre. She routinely has nightmares her former vertically challenged help Rancho (Arun Kushwah) will break into her house. Her fear of vertically-challenged men, instilled by her dwarf domestic help, finds expression in her obsession with vertically challenged television villains. That she is a scatterbrain is established in the very beginning as she rummages through her drawers to look for her cellphone.</p>
<p>The story and its life-affirming ending aside, what makes Nano So Phobia perhaps the most remarkable short of the lot is its sharp editing (masterfully done by Dnyanada Samarth) and Daniel B George&rsquo;s booming operatic background score.</p>
<p>Swaha by Smrutika Panigrahi</p>
<p>On the other hand, Smrutika Panigrahi&rsquo;s Swaaha is treated as an intriguing cat-and-mouse chase, where the husband and wife struggle to gain one-upmanship over each other to have the last word. The film follows Deepak Dobriyal&rsquo;s Kapil Agarwal, an insecure, underconfident man living in constant fear of being abandoned by his far prettier wife (Isha Talwar).</p>
<p>While attending his brother&rsquo;s engagement ceremony, Kapil gets an anonymous tip-off about his wife cheating on him. Initially scared the move may jeopardise his marriage, he finally resolves to confront his wife, who threatens to demand a lump sum alimony if he takes the matter to court. The rest of the film sees Kapil and his wife come up with ingenious arguments that slowly but assuredly dismantle the notion of the &ldquo;sanctity of marriage.&rdquo; The humour is frivolous, even bordering on the risque at times. But it is Panigrahi&rsquo;s conviction in her material that shines through a film that seeks to question age-old lofty traditions.</p>
<p>Chhaju Ke Dahi Bhalle by Gautam Govind</p>
<p>Gautam Govind Sharma&rsquo;s Chhaju Ke Dahi Bhalle is a heartwarming take of young romance seen through the lens of Partition. Amrik (Manjot Singh) and Amreen (Aisha Ahmed) find each other on a dating site, and instantly connect on their shared love Shah Rukh Khan, cricket, and street food. Belonging to orthodox families, both Amrik and Amreet remain hush-hush about their blossoming love. But soon they realise their love needs to overcome a far catawampus hurdle than familial consent.</p>
<p>Sunny Side Upar by Vijayta Kumar</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable feats of Zindagi inShort is its conscious effort to diversify its genres. The thematic resemblances between the shorts are rather slim. It is this versatility that makes Zindagi inShort a delightfully unpredictable watch. The only other film that belongs to the romantic genre is director Vijayta Kumar&rsquo;s Sunny Side Upar — but unlike Chhaju Ke Dahi Bhalle, Sunny Side Upar does not concern itself with the heady, all-consuming romance.</p>
<p>Kavya Menon (Rima Kallingal) is a go-getter oncologist too occupied with her profession to acknowledge her loved ones&rsquo; overtures or care about her own well-being. She dismisses her boyfriend Sunny&rsquo;s (Nakuul Mehta) talks about marriage as malarkey until one day, she gets the news of her brother&rsquo;s illness.</p>
<p>Where Chhaju Ke Dahi Bhalle ends at the crescendo (as do many short films), Vijayata Kumar does not shy away from being indulgent in Sunny Side Upar. Under Kumar&rsquo;s skillful direction, Kavya&rsquo;s transformation never seems half-baked or rushed, despite not having the luxury of being a feature-length film.</p>
<p>Thappad by Vinay Chawwal</p>
<p>Vinay Chawwal&rsquo;s Thappad is a cleverly conceived story of an underdog who snacks on comic books and hopes to bash bad guys up one day like his favourite superhero Super Commando Dhruva. The young Babloo is too awkward for his own good, waiting patiently for his elder sister to hand over her own tiffin to him because he was scared to ask the teacher for a tiffin break. His puny structure is frequently juxtaposed with that of the burly senior boys of his school, who corner and torment him and eve-tease his elder sister Vaani.</p>
<p>Chawwal takes a familiar story — an unassuming hero taking on a gang of powerful opponents — to burnish it with outlandish filmmaking techniques. There are slow-mo shots aplenty, which lend Thappad its heart-pumping thrill. Hardly ever does cinematographer Piyush Putty&rsquo;s camera focus on the perpetrators. It is their fidget-spinners, the footballs they are dribbling, and their brawny shoulders set against the slouching figure of Babloo that establishes the power structure. The comic book-inspired stylisation works for most of the film, except for the end. Chawwal may have attempted for his innovative short to have a compelling conclusion, but fails to stick the landing.</p>
<p>For the most part though, Zindagi inShort proves to be worth your time. If you are in the mood to indulge in some web-watching this weekend, this omnibus of short, delectable nuggets of entertainment, sans the pressure of commitment to countless follow-up seasons, will not disappoint.</p>
<p>Zindagi inShort is now streaming on the Flipkart Video app.</p>

The prevalence of documentaries about musicians is a curse, because most of these films do a terrible job of showcasing music. One rare and moving exception is the work of the director Robert Mugge, whose film “Sun Ra: A Joyful Noise”—about the musician and bandleader whose multimedia and pan-cultural activities made him one of the prime artists of Afrofuturism—is one of the most satisfying musical portraits I’ve ever seen. (It is streaming on SnagFilms and Amazon.) The film’s revelatory perspectives on Sun Ra’s work arise not only from the filmmaker’s analytical understanding of it, and the discussions that he films with Sun Ra and other members of the band, but also from his approach to filming music itself, in rehearsal and concert.</p>
<p>To see what’s exceptional about what Mugge does in “A Joyful Noise,” it’s worth considering what more conventional filmmakers tend to do in their films about other musicians. Most often, scenes of performance, whether taken from archival clips or filmed anew for the documentary at hand, run for a few seconds at a time before being covered on the soundtrack by voice-overs. It’s a pet peeve of mine. Even insightful and devoted filmmakers often prioritize conveying information and in the process lose sight—and sound—of the wonder, the miracle, the exertion at the core of the film: the work of the artist whose achievements they’re exploring.</p>
<p>The filming of music is a severe test of directorial artistry, because it’s detached from the moorings of plot and the delivery of dialogue. It’s where filmmakers’ aesthetic character is severely exposed, where they prove whether they can approach the artists they’re filming personally, subjectively, meeting the musicians’ artistic consciousness with their own. It’s often believed, or assumed, that documentary filmmaking is less a matter of style than dramatic filmmaking. Documentaries about the performing arts prove that this isn’t so. What’s more, with documentary filmmaking, aesthetics are also a matter of ethics. The readiness to reduce or subordinate musicians’ art to mere information is more than clumsy; it’s disrespectful. (Working with existing clips of performances is a test, too—film editing and the presentation of archival material is as much a matter of art as is the use of a camera.)</p>
<p>Mugge’s documentary isn’t a biography (for that, I’d highly recommend John F. Szwed’s book “Space Is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra”); the movie is set intensely and actively in the present tense. He filmed the band, called the Arkestra, in the course of two years, at and around its home base in Philadelphia’s Germantown neighborhood (where Sun Ra and his core of musicians lived and worked together), and in rehearsal and performance in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Mugge doesn’t use archival clips; he films the artists in action, displaying the varied art—of costume, dance, song, and over-all spectacle, along with innovative music—that Sun Ra’s ideas inspire. He also films them talking about their work. The film’s interviews are more like conversations; though Mugge doesn’t put himself into the frame, his rapport with the musicians, and with Sun Ra above all, is crucial to the film’s substance.</p>
<p>Sun Ra, who was in his mid-sixties at the time of the film’s shooting, is first seen amid Egyptian artifacts at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, speaking of the limitations of earthly creation and the creative power that comes from outer space—a prime declaration of the myth-centered futurism that his musical performances dramatize. (To get a sense of the mighty cultural fecundity of the idea, consider its translation into altogether blander realms—the premise of “Star Wars,” which sets its high-tech sci-fi adventures “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. . . .”) Mugge films this talk in a single slowly roving, handheld shot that follows the thread of Sun Ra’s thought while also following his amble through the exhibit—paying attention to his gait, to the touch of his hand, and to his facial expressions and his gaze.</p>
<p>In each of the movie’s sequences (approximately twenty, whether brief interludes or extended performances), the sound is recorded along with the image (or close to it). There are no voice-overs, no superimposed graphics or text, only brief title cards between scenes, stating the name of the speaker or the performer or the place where a performance or a discussion is held. The performances are largely continuous and are realized mainly in extended handheld images that rove freely among the members of the band—whether in rehearsal or in concert—and that, above all, coalesce with those performances into compositions that are as distinctive as they are revelatory. They suggest a kind of visual music in themselves. (The concert camera work is by the director of photography, Lawrence McConkey, and David Insley).</p>
<p>The cinematography doesn’t pretend to any artificial smoothness—it darts around, carried from one side of the bandstand to another, dipping to the floor before rising back to the performers, pushing closer, moving back, but maintaining a continuity, like a gaze that may flit about during a performance without losing the thread. Sun Ra blends dance and spectacle with the cosmic fury of his freest inspirations—sweeping an electronic keyboard with his arms, the backs of his hands, with his arms crossed, spinning around, playing while dancing, playing with the tops of his fingers when his back is to the keyboard. One astounding take features the tenor saxophonist John Gilmore, in an exuberant and intricate solo on an up-tempo version of Thelonious Monk’s classic “ ’Round Midnight,” which Sun Ra accompanies on electric organ and then follows with a solo. The camera dips down to the level of the keyboard, showing Sun Ra’s hands along with his face and the band in the background.</p>
<p>In one moving interview, Gilmore—who’d been performing with Sun Ra since 1953 (and led the band after Sun Ra’s death, in 1993)—explains the reason behind his decades-long devotion to Sun Ra: “He was the first one to really introduce me to the higher forms of music.” He’d worked with him for six months—“then I really heard the intervals this one night, and I said, ‘My God, this man is more stretched out than Monk. It’s unbelievable that anybody could write any meaner intervals than Monk or Mingus, but he does.’ ” The wide-ranging performances that Gilmore, one of the key modern saxophonists, delivers in the film, spanning blues-infused post-bebop intricacies and torrential free-jazz outpourings, display in action the liberating power of the musical ideas that he extols.</p>
<p>“A Joyful Noise” showcases some of the advanced music-making that resulted, including the astonishing strumming-and-shredding technique of the alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, who has been leading the band since Gilmore’s death, in 1995, and is still doing so, at the age of ninety-five. It also puts forward some of the advanced political ideas—the alienation, so to speak—that are reflected in Sun Ra’s metaphysical philosophy, notably at an interview done in front of the White House, where Sun Ra wonders about the absence of a “Black House” and sets forth his philosophy of inseparable opposites: “You can’t have a Justice Department that goes out looking for only criminals and never go out looking for people who are doing good. You can’t have justice if you penalize people for doing wrong and don’t do anything to help them when they’re trying to do right.”

<p><img src="https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&amp;fit=1280%2C640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F02%2Fphoto-1512615199361-5c7a110a8d11.jpeg&amp;signature=e9899057ea5117eaf2beaf4548cd4326" alt="img">
One in three people are expected to develop cancer during their lifetime. With the help of AI-based algorithms, pathologists will be able to deliver better and faster diagnoses.</p>
<p>New cancer cases will increase by almost 70% over the next two decades, from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million. In the US, the National Cancer Institute reports that one in three people are expected to develop cancer in their lifetime. Pathologists are dealing with growing caseloads while patients are increasingly expecting high-quality diagnoses and treatments, causing delays in delivering diagnoses.</p>
<p>Pathology, the medical branch that focuses on the causes, manifestations, and diagnosis of diseases such as cancer has changed little in over a century. With the growing number and complexity of cancer cases and other illnesses, pathology is just starting to see the benefits from increased productivity and efficiencies enabled by digitization and AI.</p>
<p>The AI will see you now</p>
<p>Digitization allows specialists to access a larger set of medical data to get a better understanding of their patients, enhancing prognosis and outcomes. AI helps further, to make sense of that data.</p>
<p>Today, AI is successfully applied to pattern recognition and quantitative measurement on whole slide images to detect cancer and other abnormalities. In one study, researchers from Case Western Reserve University found that a deep learning system could identify invasive forms of breast cancer in pathology images with 100 percent accuracy.</p>
<p>AI-based software by Philips</p>
<p>Philips, a global leader in health technology, has made significant headway in Digital and Computational Pathology (DCP) with its Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution. The technology enables pathologists to diagnose digital images more efficiently and accurately with the support of other clinicians while streamlining workflow practices.</p>
<p>In 2017, Philips started marketing the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution as the first and currently the only digital pathology solution in the US (the largest healthcare market) for primary diagnostic use.</p>
<p>Philips introduced its first deep learning product to support accurate tumor estimation for molecular research. The next challenge would be to develop these type of algorithms to clinical grade and seamlessly deploy in the diagnostic workflow. A seamless clinical deployment of AI involves careful considerations to the workflow including execution time (anything more than a few minutes runtime defies the purpose), total cost of deployment and flexibility and control for the pathologist always.</p>
<p>How is Philips different from other industry players?</p>
<p>Philips has partnered with several leading key opinion leaders (KOLs)and healthcare providers such as Mount Sinai which has the world’s leading breast cancer data repository and LabPON which plans to create the world’s largest pathology database using Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution.</p>
<p>With the help of their large curated repository of real-world medical data, Philips will be able to build clinically robust deep learning algorithms that can handle variability in data sources and disease subtypes. This data makes it possible for AI solutions to go beyond proof of concept and be adopted for a high throughput routine clinical practice.</p>
<p>What’s it like to work on AI-based healthcare?</p>
<p>Arun Ananthapadmanabhan, Head of Products, Philips Computational Pathology explains: “AI is everywhere today, and data scientists are in demand. The worst thing you can do to a data scientist is hire them and not provide them with the right data. Relevant, processed, high quality curated data is not easy to come by and takes a long time to build up.”</p>
<p>“There are numerous opportunities for applying AI to healthcare,” adds Philips’ Data Scientist Ariadne Whitby. “It is an exciting domain to work in, evident from the numerous AI-based healthtech startups, as well as advances from the established players. It’s great to see the many innovative ideas and companies out there.”</p>
<p>Whitby joined DCP Philips because it combined the best of both worlds – a dynamic, startup environment backed by a strong parent company. “I wanted to join an organization where there is domain knowledge to understand how to integrate a new product or concept into the healthcare system, and the channels to distribute it. I didn’t want to risk working on something awesome which doesn’t get realized because of the lack of commercial know-how.”</p>
<p>“AI in healthcare, and specifically digital pathology, is one of the key focus areas for Philips”, says Arun. “Digital pathology combines the power of a startup with our experience and rich heritage of innovation. We continue to grow fast, and our teams are young, diverse and highly skilled. They wake up every day thinking about the next step in solving the global problem of cancer,” he concludes.</p>
<p>Get ready</p>
<p>The digital transformation of pathology is well underway. AI is helping to replace subjectivity with sophisticated quantitative measurements, while cutting-edge technologies and data-driven solutions are improving the reliability and quality of diagnoses, treatments and patient care.</p>
<p>But these deep learning systems cannot be made without the help of software talent. So with these developments come trailblazing career possibilities for software developers and data scientists who want to be changing the future of healthcare. Are you ready?</p>
<p>This post is brought to you by Philips.

<h3 id="film-review-valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets">&ldquo;Film Review: ‘Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/valerian-review.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
A long time ago in our very own galaxy, Luc Besson dreamed of directing a movie version of “Valérian and Laureline,” a sexy French comic book series featuring a pair of futuristic crime fighters who travel through space and time to uphold the law. Although scholars consider the pulp source material to have been an influence on George Lucas’ original “Star Wars” movie, the equation clearly works the other way around in Besson’s hands, as “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets” finds the director doing his best “Star Wars” impression.</p>
<p>It’s a bold goal in a marketplace that hasn’t traditionally been very welcoming to “Star Wars” imitators, but Besson is one of the few living directors with both the ambition and the ability to establish his own rival universe. At a time when “Star Wars” itself has gone corporate (granted, the tight control has yielded some of the series’ best entries), “Valerian” manages to be both cutting-edge and delightfully old-school — the kind of wild, endlessly creative thrill ride that only the director of “Lucy” and “The Fifth Element” could deliver, constructed as an episodic series of missions, scrapes and near-misses featuring a mind-blowing array of environments and stunning computer-generated alien characters.</p>
<p>Related Stories</p>
<p>Too bad Valerian himself is such a dud. Written as a kind of cocky intergalactic lothario, Valerian ought to be as sexy and charismatic as a young Han Solo, though “Chronicle” star Dane DeHaan — so good in brooding-emo mode — seems incapable of playing the kind of aloof insouciance that made Harrison Ford so irresistible. Despite holding the rank of major, Valerian looks like an overgrown kid, overcompensating via an unconvincingly gruff faux Keanu Reeves accent (with the questionable dye job to match).</p>
<p>Fortunately, his co-star is cool enough for the both of them: As played by British fashion model Cara Delevingne (downright wooden in last summer’s “Suicide Squad,” but a revelation here: sassy, sarcastic and spontaneous), Laureline holds true to one of Besson’s core beliefs — that nothing’s sexier than an assertive, empowered leading lady. Sure, she needs rescuing at times, but more often than not, she’s the one getting Valerian out of trouble. She’s just a sergeant, but every bit as capable as her commanding officer, and the film is considerably more fun when following her character.</p>
<p>The chemistry between the two may be odd, but they make a good team, constantly trying to prove themselves to one another while each pretending not to care. In their first scene together, Valerian asks Laureline to marry him — a strangely old-fashioned demand, given the 28th-century setting, that plays like a 1950s ploy to seduce the virginal preacher’s daughter. And yet, in so many ways, she seems worldlier than he does, right down to the film’s climactic monologue, in which Laureline lectures Valerian on the meaning of love.</p>
<p>Most of the time, he’s too busy following orders to question what his superiors are asking, but such blind obedience has its bounds, since the plot of “Valerian” concerns a vast military coverup for a cataclysm Besson depicts in the film’s opening minutes: the near-annihilation of a seemingly primitive, yet peaceful species known as Pearls. Tall, slender and scantily dressed, like “Avatar’s” Na’vi, with bald heads and iridescent opaline skin, the Pearl are the most elegant and expressive of the movie’s many computer-generated aliens. Their long limbs give them a graceful, supermodel gait, while their faces are nuanced enough to convey even subtle emotions — testament to just how sophisticated performance capture technology has become, even in someone other than Andy Serkis’ hands.</p>
<p>Such innovations make it possible for Besson to build upon the multiculturalism of the “Star Wars” series in a big way, taking the intermingling of species in the classic cantina scene and expanding it to a vast city named Alpha, where a seemingly infinite number of aliens happily stick to their roles (like a pre-equal-opportunity Zootopia), while humans of all colors run the show (including Herbie Hancock as the city’s Minister of Defense). No doubt, there are dark and sordid “Blade Runner”-esque corners to this hyper-modern megalopolis, but Besson never lingers long enough for us to play more than fly-by tourist as he follows Valerian and Laureline through these various realms.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Besson works at a fast clip, using dynamic framing and tight editing to convey loads of visual information on the go. The movie is designed to propel us from one cliffhanger to the next, and it’s remarkably effective at doing so without providing a clear notion of what the duo’s mission is supposed to be. Early on, they’re sent to Big Market, a massive virtual-reality bazaar where Valerian manages to retrieve an adorable, ultra-rare creature known as a Mül Converter, which can make copies of anything it ingests (except itself, apparently), from a Jabba the Hutt-like black marketeer voiced by John Goodman.</p>
<p>The movie kicks in during the Big Market sequence, which is where audiences first feel like we’re discovering a truly visionary new environment for the first time — though Besson manages to sustain that effect throughout the film’s time on Alpha. There we meet Commander Arun Filitt (Clive Owen), the four-star general who’s been using Valerian to help fulfill his own dastardly agenda, and discover a world of eye-popping costumes. Besson’s script may occasionally leave something to be desired, but one can hardly fault the way his characters are dressed, as costume designer Olivier Bériot gives us a sample of the future of fashion (so avant garde that it could take decades for sci-fi to catch up).</p>
<p>In one case — that of a glampod named Bubble (played by Rihanna, when in human form) — a shape-shifting alien actually functions as a kind of elaborate costume, wrapping herself around Valerian so he can infiltrate the dangerous gourmands who plan to eat his darling Laureline. In a nifty trick, Bubble can remove her hat and change outfits entirely, making for the galaxy’s sexiest exotic dance routine.</p>
<p>Even Besson, who convinced the world that Milla Jovovich could act (in “The Fifth Element”), can’t salvage Rihanna’s awkward line readings — unless that’s the effect this sophisticated, Shakespeare-trained glampod is going for. But that’s a small hiccup considering what the director gets from Delevingne: She doesn’t just save Alpha; she saves the movie as well. And though audiences may not be clamoring for a “Valerian” sequel after this, another “Laureline” adventure would be most welcome.

<h3 id="varun-tej-interview-chiranjeevi-pawan-inspired-me-varun-tej">&ldquo;Varun Tej interview: Chiranjeevi, Pawan inspired me: Varun Tej&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-46444285,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-18523/46444285.jpg" alt="img">
Varun Tej, who made his debut with Mukunda, a romantic drama that explores student politics in a small town, remains unfazed with the mixed response for the film. In the movie, Varun played a brooding young man,who doesn���t even talk to his co-star Pooja Hegde, but is ever ready to help his friend. He tells Hyderabad Times what he learnt from the film, his uncle, Chiranjeevi, and more. Excerpts from an interview:When I was young, I grew up watching only my pedananna���s (Chiranjeevi) films. I remember having his life-size poster, along with that of babai���s (Pawan Kalyan), in my bedroom and I used to dream of following their footsteps. My father (Naga Babu) used to tell me how hard-working Chiranjeevi is. Once I was on the sets of Stalin, where a song was being shot, I could see himlimping due to knee pain. However, the moment he was expected to face the camera, his dance moves blew me away. He was dancing like a 20-year-old. He didn���t have to teach me anything in particular.When you hear and see someone in your own family setting a benchmark, it���s inspiring.I am proud to have done a film like Mukunda and it was a huge learning experience. Prior to my debut, I was interested in knowing what people were writing about me and it got really scary after a point. Sai Dharam Tej told me that I shouldn���t think so much about what others were saying or writing about me. There was no pressure as such, but my father wanted me to become a director. The only time I get scared is when people expect me to dance like Ram Charan or Allu Arjun (laughs). Right now, my focus is on exploring and improving my acting, and choosing good scripts.There���s an age gap between Charan, Bunny and me. When I was a kid, I used to play a lot with Sai Dharam Tej and Srija (Chiranjeevi���s younger daughter). Right now, I am very close to Sai Dharam Tej. Charan and I discuss a lot about my work, and Bunny suggested that I hear as many scripts as I can before taking a final call.That advice helped me a lot.He said that I should never look idle in any frame, even if I don���t have a dialogue in the scene. Since it���s coming from him, the feedback has to be spot on (smiles).I have had people telling me that they liked my screen presence and my voice, so I guess that���s my strength.To be honest, my characterisation in Mukunda didn���t allow me to go all out in terms of how much I can emote, but all that is going to change in Krish���s film. It���s a period drama set in the 1940s and I���m really excited about what Krish has come up with. And about my gait, Prakash Raj and Ravi Teja suggested that I should take longer strides and some people said that I should lose more weight, because right now, the way I run or walk looks awkward on screen.More than that, I guess (laughs). I���m a big time foodie and at one point of time, I used to weight nearly 125 kilos and then I lost a lot of weight. I gave up almost everything and for the past six weeks, I have been on a strict diet to get the right look for my upcoming film. When you are 6���3 and weigh more than 90 kg, it���s not easy. For the record, I wear size 12 shoes. I���ve been working on developing lower body strength to improve my posture.I like my privacy. I was completely okay when people didn���t recognise me. I have the same set of friends for almost 20 years now and we hang out all the time. And it���s only now that I have begun meeting more people and talk to them when they approach me for a photograph. It feels good when you get that sort of attention from people around you.

<h3 id="yes-im-gay-and-this-is-how-god-made-me">&ldquo;Yes I’m gay, and this is how God made me&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-12342900,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-29601/12342900.jpg" alt="img">
Last month, the MP High Court turned down the plea of a lesbian couple from Indore, who had sought security fearing a threat to their lives if they lived together.</p>
<p>This happened just a few days after a staggering 1500 people from the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community in Indore ‘came out’, declaring their identity and sexual orientation through a report in The Times of India. They’ve also formed a society, the Badlav Samiti, which is headed by Rajnish Langer, to work for gay rights. We ask a few of them why they decided to come out, living in a state like MP, where people are far from accepting homosexuals.</p>
<p>We are born gay: Rajnish</p>
<p>Rajnish Langer (37) is a graduate and was in the dog breeding business before. A homosexual himself, Rajnish had initiated the formation of a gay community, Badlav Samiti, and brought together other homosexuals of Indore. He met a few of them through social networking sites and a few others through common friends. Apart from spearheading the Badlav Samiti, he is also into the business of selling antique furniture and artefacts.</p>
<p>He says, “Everyone in my family knows that I am a gay. Main jab lehra ke chalta tha aur patli awaz mein bolta tha toh meri behen mujhe chidhaati thi. But now she understands me more than anyone else. My family members never said anything. I had a boyfriend in my school. His father would tease me that I have a girl’s gait. People need to understand that just like they are born straight, we are born gay. It’s natural. Like normal people, we too have feelings for others. I was in a relationship after school, and it lasted for a year, but now I am too mature to fall in love again. I decided to declare myself gay publicly to change society’s perception. People look at us as if we are untouchables. I want them to understand that we are equally human as straight people. People make fun of me, they laugh at me. Probably, they will understand the day a gay is born to them.”</p>
<p>Childhood was a nightmare: Santosh</p>
<p>Santosh Dubale, a 21-year-old BCom graduate, is an accountant in Badlav Samiti. He says, “My childhood was a nightmare. I faced problems because of my girlish behaviour. I was too young to understand about ‘straight’ and ‘gay’. When my classmates used to tease me for behaving like a girl, I felt like dropping out of school. As I grew up, I found myself to be different from others. My physical build is that of a male, but I never felt anything for girls. I find males more attractive. I thought of declaring myself to be gay because I don’t want people to tease and irritate me anymore. Aage kadam toh badhana hi hoga, otherwise log hamesha humein chhedte rahenge aur hum hamesha andhere aur sharam mein jeete rahenge. After our news was published in TOI, people would come to me and say that I’m spoiling the society, and that being gay is unnatural. I know it’s too early for people to understand, but I’m sure they will one day soften their stand towards us.”</p>
<p>I wanted to commit suicide: Rahul</p>
<p>Rahul Sharma, a 22-year-old salesman, works in a cosmetic’s shop in Indore. “I was so frustrated with everyone passing comments and teasing me, that I wanted to commit suicide. Log haste hain, chidhaate hain. I don’t tease them for being straight. I found my world when I met Rajnish. He introduced me to other people in the gay community. Now, I feel very comfortable in their company. I don’t feel an outcaste in their company. I don’t feel abnormal. We laugh, play, share things and we are happy together. My decision to come out in the open with my true identity was a very well thought out step. My point is, if I am not ashamed of myself, then why should I hide my true identity? I am as normal as anyone else. I am in a relationship with a guy for the last seven years. And I don’t hide it from anyone. As far as society is concerned, they will have to accept us. I keep hearing comments like ‘society ko bigaad rahe hain yeh log’, but I have not faced any serious threat till now.”</p>
<p>I’m not afraid of society: Ajay</p>
<p>Ajay Banoda, 39, works with Rajnish for their group. Narrating his story, he says, “It was very upsetting for me when others used to call me gay. Mujhe bura lagta tha lekin ab nahi lagta. My friends call me Sweety. I know I am different from others, but that is how God has made me. Apna haq maangne ke liye open hua hoon main. I have the right to live as respectfully as the ‘straight’ people are living in society. I am not afraid of anyone now. We talk of gender equality, but the focus is only on male and female equality. What about us? We too want equality in society. You can’t imagine how it feels when people look at us with the intent of mocking us. I have faced all that and I want people to stop it. I felt the need to bring a change in people’s perception about gays, and someone has to come forward for it. So why not me?” Ajay further says, “I had a boyfriend who left me and got married. I know he is cheating on his wife because he is gay. But he got married under societal pressure.”</p>
<p>I’ll not marry a girl: Rajesh</p>
<p>Rajesh Lalwani, a 23-year-old matriculate, left his home because his parents were forcing him to marry a girl. He now has a catering business. He says, “Why should I marry and spoil someone else’s life when I don’t have any feelings for girls? I don’t want to live a two-faced life. Society will not allow me to marry the guy I love, because it is against their self-decided-norms. When I told my parents that I’m gay and that I don’t feel anything for girls, they thought I was joking and was inspired by “Dostana”, the movie. But after they started forcing me to marry a girl, I left home. I was away from home for two months. Now, they have called me back and have promised me that they won’t force me to get married. I then decided to go public about my sexual orientation, so that people don’t bring any marriage proposals for me. Another reason is that I don’t want people to mock us all the time. What is their problem if I am gay? How is it affecting them?”
