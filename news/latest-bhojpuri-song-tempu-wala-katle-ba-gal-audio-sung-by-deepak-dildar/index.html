<h3 id="life-in-the-times-of-a-corona-day">&ldquo;Life In The Times Of A Corona Day&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.businessworld.in/article/article_extra_large_image/1586354461_dvqCFh_Corona_Combat_Drone_CCD_.jpg" alt="img">
These are Corona times. Having led a hectic life, most of the times trying to complete projects and meeting schedules, for more than a month now, we have been strapped to our homes, not knowing what to do and how to spend time. We never could spend a moment for the family or our friends. In a way, there was no social life. Corona has changed all that, bringing the quality time for some, boring time for many and anxiety for the others.</p>
<p>Amidst the growing anxiety, some of us are working from home, exercising at home, doing household chores and watching movies, TV shows, or reading books. Some of us are hooked on to our mobiles and the Net, for all time except that spent on sleep. A few are innovative and learning new skills like manicure, pedicure, new hairstyles or facemasks. Some are giving their house a makeover, some learning and improving their culinary skills and still some connecting with memories. The social butterflies are active via their phones. Those with creativity flowing in them, are writing poetry, making mobile movies on TikTok and indulging in indoor photography. Some are still hooked on to WFH via Zoom. However, many of us, are worrying ourselves to new illnesses, but do not want to quit a bad habit or even get organised better.</p>
<p>Like many of you, the Corona times have made me re-live my childhood. Reminiscing the youthful times, exercising and listening to music that was made more than six-seven decades ago, which brought back the pent-up yearnings and memories of a brief tryst in the early eighties, with the English theatre, hosted in the iconic Prithvi theatre and how it has changed over the years and the many friends made during those times which, however, was rudely interrupted by the academic pursuits later. It is not only the theatre that has changed but also the transformation in the way movies are made, in the storytelling, in the way music is made, the audience and even the critics, has been phenomenal.</p>
<p>How an intrinsically pure art form was reduced to just commerce and entertainment, did cause irritation and anger. “Anything in the name of entertainment” is the norm. Great strides in Electronics and Computers have been driving the entertainment industry. The vice versa may or may not be true. Whereas electronics wizardry is at its best, what is dished out on the screen has often been cacophony. The electronic music has completely taken over Organic music. The electronic music is fast and easy to create and has multiple possibilities but has taken away the soul from the music. Every instrument is sorted out in a PC today. One, on the computer, is even composing music, using a digital audio workstation. In-fact the music is so overwhelming that at times, people hardly care for what the lyrics are, or how fine the singing is. On the other hand, Acoustic music is more beautiful and touching the soul and spirit of humans. It even uses the sounds of nature. In this melee, the ‘Raga’ seems to have quietly exited the repertoire.</p>
<p>While lyrics are retrofit today, to electronically pre-composed music, they have taken away the lyricist from the melody, dishing out inane blabber to assembled music. Lyrics are the soul of a song. Most of the retro-hits have been senseless in recent times. The sheer brilliance of the song ‘man tarpat hari darshan ko aaj’ from the film ‘Baiju Bawra’, is a sheer art form. The literary genius of ‘Shakeel Badayuni’, composed in Rag ‘Malkauns’ by the gifted Naushad and rendered brilliantly by ‘Mohammad Rafi’ is a balm to an injured soul that lets one transcend beyond the spiritual. There are many beautiful ragas like ‘Bhopali’, ‘Durga’, ‘Hamsadhwani’, or ‘Hindol’ in which songs were composed. Another that comes to mind is ‘Murli bairan bhayi, Kanhaiya tori’, from the film ‘New Delhi’, penned by an accomplished lyricist ‘Hasrat Jaipuri’ composed in Raag ‘Bhairavi’ by those music mavericks ‘Shankar Jaikishan’ and sung so melodiously by ‘Lata Mangeshkar’. Use of harmonium/accordion by Kankan Dasgupta in the song was pure magic. Who can forget the iconic song ‘aapki nazron ne samjha’ from the film ‘Anpadh’, sung again by the inimitable Lata Mangeshkar, composed in Raag ‘Adana’ by one in a lifetime ‘Madan Mohan’ to the lyrics of a par excellent ‘Raja Mehdi Ali Khan’? In music, it needs three to tango. Every classic had three brilliant artists behind its creation. Their talent hit a target no one else could hit. Their genius hit a target no one else could see.</p>
<p>It is a connoisseur’s misfortune that purity of form is replaced now by a queer mix of Punjabi and Hinglish as the language, metal to compose music and a wrapper for a lyricist. Are not ‘Mashups’, technologically creative works, created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs, by superimposing the vocal track of one song seamlessly over the instrumental track of another, increasing the tempo and pitch while adding or reducing gaps to make it flow, further eroding the purity of the original compositions? Are they not violating the copyright laws? It is very heartening to hear a young and accomplished music composer and singer, Armaan Malik when he said no more to ‘remixing’ in an interview to entertainment times. Hope we find more of his ilk.</p>
<p>There are no more storylines that carry a movie. Instead, we see formula and masala films. Too many films are blighted by lacklustre music, with directors failing to grasp the potential of a great score to enhance the viewing experience. Today’s Masala films have all the key ingredients that go into the making of a film. The archetypal characters and star actors of 1940s, through to 1980s have given way to method actors. There are Software’s available that take inputs like ‘Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl again’ along with multiple short statements as keywords that are randomly moved around to create several hypothetical situations resulting in new storylines. Several props and superlative visual effects have made redundant a need to emote. Add to this potpourri, a set of even average performers, a few songs with rappers scoring metallic music, you have a new movie for the theatres. No wonder, some of them turn out to be critical, pan low score or “rotten tomato”, akin to fast food. Films like ‘Mr. and Mrs 55’, ‘Pyaasa’, ‘Mughal-e Azam’, ‘Mother India’ or ‘Guide’ were all classics that had heart and soul put into them with creative art masters at the helm. They were not assembly-line products. Have they not stood the test of time? Several names may just turn to dust over time but not these, for they were made of life, that me and you breathe.</p>
<p>Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The realisation that this was not sudden, but took a good three decades, did bring a tad happiness but more sadness. Thus, lost in the memories on a corona lockdown day, the ecstatic insanity of romantic pursuit was shattered by the corona induced reality, so much so, that it has become unbearable to listen to them again, for they were bringing back the memories so vividly.</p>

Given the song’s popularity, the staff on then president Ronald Reagan’s campaign trail thought it might be the perfect track for his 1984 re-election campaign, but it was rebuffed by Springsteen’s team. When Reagan referenced Springsteen in a speech anyway, he questioned if the then-president had even listened to his music. This incident paved the way for other artists to tell politicians to stop using their songs as endorsement. Bruce Springsteen ‘Born in the USA’ was written as an ironic retort to the Vietnam War.

<p>Has papa listened yet to the song “Prada”, Dinesh Auluck’s 14-year-old son wanted to know. “Prada” is a recent track that is creating ripples in the Punjabi music scene. Auluck, 42, is the cofounder of Speed Records, the largest music label in Punjab . But even for him, things can feel too frenetic.The rise and fall of singers, music videos with lavish production budgets that amass hundreds of millions of views on YouTube, new sensations born virtually overnight, the overhang of drugs, guns and violence, and the thrill of taste-making — Punjab listens today to what India will hear tomorrow — can all get overwhelming.These are heady days in Punjab’s music industry and Mohali is where the action is. It’s a veritable music factory — some 20 songs are written, composed, recorded and released here every day, by some reckoning.The Land of Five Rivers is overflowing with artistes and music labels, all vying for virality, stardom and revenues. There are some 400 registered labels, with some 20 leading the pack. “Prada”, a slow-romantic number by rookie artiste Jass Manak, went online in mid June, and within a fortnight had become a rage with kids his son’s age, notes Auluck. At the time of writing, the track had amassed 79 million views on YouTube.The heady rise of Punjabi music is a result of several factors. The state has a long-standing tradition of music and live performance. The massive Punjabi diaspora overseas, now brought closer by digital distribution, is a big market for online sales and live shows. Producers of Punjabi origin who grew up in cities such as London or Toronto brought back a distinct quality and production sensibility to the state.And Bollywood, which is deeply influenced by Punjabi culture , now just can’t get enough of Punjabi songs.But Auluck remembers a simpler time, when things were not so frenetic, but which nonetheless laid the foundations for today’s success. He remembers the ’80s when Jalandhar was the hub of Punjabi media, and artistes who performed on DD Punjabi’s prime time show Lishkara, were declared superstars the following day. “That’s where Gurdas Maanji sang his breakthrough song ‘Mamla gadbad hai’ for the first time,” he recalls.He has seen how, in the ’90s, when Gurdas Maan came to a village to perform a show, the entire community left everything behind to attend en masse.Music has always been a big part of Punjab’s culture and history. It is through Punjabi folk music that poets have narrated love ballads of Heer-Ranjha and Sohni-Mahiwal, Mirza-Sahiba and Sassi-Punhoon. Several musical instruments like Tumbi, Algoze, Dhadd and Chimta are unique to Punjab.Different occasions have different kinds of songs. You sing suhag to express the bittersweet feelings associated with a wedding, tappe to celebrate Lohri and Baisakhi, and boliyan to sing while doing gidda, a Punjabi dance form. Then there’s the Sufi Punjabi music, the bhangra, and the most commercial of them all — Punjabi pop. There is a song for every occasion here.Bollywood, the dominant player in the Indian music scene, has always had a Punjabi influence in its song-anddance routine; largely courtesy Yash Raj Films and Dharma Productions, both run by Punjabi families, the Chopras and the Johars. It made the mainstream audience associate dancing with the region’s music. Thus, Punjabi songs started playing at weddings, parties and discotheques around the country.While shaking a leg to “Tera rang balle balle” or shimmying to “Maahi ve”, what many didn’t realise was how the Punjabi beat was slowly beginning to rival Bollywood’s own tempo.Just last year, three of the 10 most popular Bollywood songs across several platforms, were revamped versions of old Punjabi tracks. These include “Ban ja tu meri rani” from Tumhari Sulu, “Main tera boyfriend” from Raabta, and “Dil chori sadda” from Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety.Originally sung by Punjabi artistes Guru Randhawa, J Star, and Hans Raj Hans, these are just the latest in a long line of Punjabi tracks that Bollywood has embraced. It shouldn’t be surprising then that Punjabi music has the largest share in the independent music industry of India.At approximately Rs 700 crore (including revenue from songs and live-events), it is almost five times the size of the Telugu music industry, the second-largest market in the category.And there’s more to this mammoth than just Bollywood’s overreliance on its tunes. Punjabis love their own music and prefer it over any other. There was a time in the late ’90s and early 2000s when a car passing on any road in Punjab playing Hindi music would be met with a judgmental scowl. Gurpreet Singh Bhasin, founder of artiste management company One Digital Entertainment, has seen this play out in his hometown Chandigarh.Many pop stars of yesteryears took to their second language, Hindi, while pursuing their singing career. Most Punjabi singers stuck to their native language. In 29-year-old Dilin Nair’s case, a heavy Punjabi influence while growing up in Delhi made him choose it over his native language Malayalam when he decided to pursue a career in music. The world now knows him as Raftaar, the rapper.People who understand Hindi find it easy to grasp Punjabi, which can’t be said for many other regional languages and, therefore, their music. Kolkata-born and Delhi-based Soumya Sinha has a Punjabi playlist on his phone. The 32-year-old amateur singer got hooked on to Punjabi melody as it offered him something different from the softer tone intrinsic to the Bengali music he grew up listening.Punjabi music consumption has grown by 5X in the last one year, says Prashan Agarwal, CEO of music streaming app Gaana. “Today, Punjabi music comprises a fifth of the app’s overall music consumption.” Some 40% of the app’s traffic for Punjabi songs comes from Delhi-NCR, UP, and Maharashtra.(Gaana is part of Times Internet, a subsidiary of Bennett, Coleman and Co Ltd, which publishes The Economic Times).The Punjabi music industry is further strengthened by its fans outside India. There are over 130 million native speakers of Punjabi all over the world.At 94 million, Pakistan alone has thrice as many Punjabi-speaking people as India. And while they do have their own legends like Ataullah Khan, Shoukat Ali and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Punjab’s nightingale Surinder Kaur’s classics moisten eyes on both sides of the border.Concerts of Gurdas Maan and Dosanjh are packed to the rafters both inland and overseas, but the lion’s share of any leading Punjabi artiste’s income comes from performing at weddings. Most of them charge anywhere between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 40 lakh and do 75 to 100 such events in a year.Punjab is a rich market and it keeps acknowledging new talent every now and then. That’s why even small artistes manage to get a show for Rs 50,000,” says Bhushan Kumar, chairman of T-Series. Punjabi music currently accounts for 40% of his company’s music business. Its artiste Guru Randhawa is making Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh per show, Kumar tells ET Magazine.Artistes from several other regions lose out on this revenue stream because their practice is rooted in classical music, which in India has a strong emphasis on spirituality. Punjabi artistes, however, grow up associating music with revelry and therefore don’t have any such hang-ups to be the entertainer at a party.In fact, for a lot of Punjabis who return from the UK or Canada, producing a single or an album used to be the biggest high in their life, says Tarsame Mittal, owner of a talent management company, who’s observed this business grow over the last two decades.It was one such NRI intervention in the late ’90s that proved pivotal for the industry. The early ’90s were all about Daler Mehndi and Sukhbir — the two singers who took bhangra mainstream. In came Punjab-born, UK-based Jaswinder Singh Bains aka Jazzy B. “Jazzy B’s singing style was unique. Even the non-Punjabi speaking audience could understand his lyrics,” recalls Mandar Thakur, COO of Times Music, who was overseeing music and programming at Channel V at the time. (Times Music is a unit of The Times Group, which publishes The Economic Times.)Jazzy B’s exposure to international studios and soundscapes modernised Punjabi music as we knew it. “People started calling him Modern Chamkila when he instantly rose to fame,” recalls Aulukh.Amar Singh Chamkila, also known as the Elvis of Punjab, was an irreverent artiste who had a stellar run in the 1980s on the back of his real and raw singing and songwriting. His music is believed to have been the motive behind his murder by unidentified gunmen in 1988.With digitisation in, cassettes and CDs have gone out. YouTube views took over as the metric of popularity. The means to make money transformed but the money kept growing. “Wedding budgets expanded and an artiste’s average count of annual shows went up from 20 to 100 within a decade,” Mittal points out.At present, major music labels charge an estimated annual licence fee of Rs 1.5 crore from regional radio stations and music channels.The monthly revenue they make off YouTube ads on their videos is typically in the range of Rs 60 lakh to Rs 80 lakh. FICCI-EY’s latest report on India’s media and entertainment sector pegged the Indian music industry at Rs 1,300 crore. Players estimate the organised Punjabi music industry to be worth Rs 200 crore at the moment, with an additional Rs 500 crore coming from live shows.Artistes such as Diljit Dosanjh, Guru Randhawa, Badshah and Raftaar have transcended their popularity in the region to become mainstream stars — they’re now charging as much if not more than what most leading Bollywood singers make from live events. In the last two years, three of Randhawa’s 20 singles have been revamped into top Bollywood chartbusters.Punjabi rap, a genre brought to Bollywood by Honey Singh, has been turned into a staple for the market by rappers Badshah and Raftaar. And Dosanjh is both singing for and doing the lead roles in big-banner Bollywood movies.Just two years ago, Dosanjh was pleading with Adidas for a pair of sneakers that were out of stock. Today, he is the brand ambassador for Coca-Cola and Flipkart in Punjab. Adidas sends him its latest model of shoes every month as a token of appreciation. “Abhi standard thoda theek ho gaya hai,” says the Jalandhar-born singer who now pulls in an estimated Rs 30 crore in a year in fees and endorsements.The opportunity in the space has given birth to different revenue models. In one corner of Mohali, lyricist Bunty Bains has set up a company that scouts for talent, trains them, sponsors them — all for a 50% cut in their future earnings. “We don’t just invest in producing great music. We build great artistes.If an artiste is backed by us, people will know they can do shows and hold an audience besides being great musicians,” says Bains, whose company BrandB has launched 15 artistes across singing, composition and direction in the last seven years. In its first year of operation, BrandB earned revenues of Rs 1.57 crore, he recalls. Last year, it clocked Rs 16 crore.Leading labels have now entered into revenue-sharing deals with artistes, instead of just launching their songs. Singers like Gippy Grewal have launched their own music label. Singer Amrinder Gill’s company handles the production and distribution for all his songs and movies.A popular rapper-singer is launching a Punjabi channel soon. Every other person in Punjab, it can sometimes seem, is making songs. As things get a bit overheated, the industry is also reckoning with issues.The rising importance of the digital world to the industry has sparked allegations of widespread fake-view scams, where artistes and labels pay to prop up their virtual popularity. This has raised questions over the credibility of YouTube views.Artistes like Randhawa are quick to defend theirs: “We upload our songs online and leave. We’re not that jobless to devise ways to garner fake views.A lot of my songs have fetched hundreds of millions of views and I’m proud to have represented my country overseas based on the popularity of those songs.” To Speed Records’ Auluck, though, views as a benchmark of an artiste’s success has limited meaning. “There are many old artistes in Punjab who do 50-100 shows a year but their videos have only 200,000 views.Many of the new artistes may have millions of views on their videos but 10 people won’t turn up if they announce a show,” he says. Punjabi pop music is also often accused of propagating violence and machismo in a state struggling with an epidemic of drug addiction. This came into sharp focus in April, when singer Parmish Verma, who rose to instant stardom on the back of his gansta-themed videos, was shot at.“I don’t blame anyone for this, but the unfortunate truth is that this kind of stuff sells the most,” says Dosanjh, referring to the criticism over popular themes. In the past, a lot of his songs about women empowerment haven’t received the same push as “Panj Taara”, a song about a guy who’s been dumped and is dealing with it by getting drunk and breaking stuff at a five-star hotel.“Some of my most meaningful songs also have the least number of views.” Some changes are afoot, hearteningly. Songwriters like Jaani are creating songs told from a woman’s perspective that are being well received. Women artistes such as Jasmine Sandlas, Sunanda Sharma and Jenny Johal are rapidly climbing the popularity charts. Rapper Raftaar, in addition to creating pro-women rap songs, is focusing on using social media responsibly.He says the younger generation gets influenced more by their favourite celeb’s daily feeds than their songs.“As artistes, we sell dreams. I don’t want kids to dream of a lifestyle where violence, mindless drinking, and casual women-bashing is considered cool. I don’t want to show fun the wrong way.”Artistes of Punjabi music industry are on the crest of a wave right now. Many newcomers get carried away by the sudden onrush of money and fame. This affects their consistency and output. Dosanjh points out how Punjabi pop stars rise, dazzle and fade away, all in a matter of weeks.In contrast, Auluck knows of instances where Gurdas Maan has performed for a couple’s wedding and then, 25 years later, been invited to perform for their son’s wedding as well. “How many artistes from the current generation can command that kind of respect?” he asks.

The second single from Dear Comrade which was supposed to release today has been pushed. The makers of the film had earlier revealed that the second single from the film will be released today. The recent news is that the second single will be out on May 15 at 11:11 am.The music director of the film Justin Prabhakaran , male lead Vijay Deverakonda and director Bharat Kamma took to social media to apologise to the fans in a funny way. Vijay posted, ‘We don&rsquo;t have any excuse - It was my birthday, we played cricket, we got body pains, we sat and listened to song on loop and couldn&rsquo;t finish cutting video - teacher got distracted 😀 Song pakka on 15th - 11:11 AM #ammathodu #DearComrade (sic)’Justin and Bharat also blamed Vijay Deverakonda for distracting them which led to the delay in the release of the single. The film has Rashmika Mandanna playing the female lead. This is the second time Vijay and Rashmika are coming together for a film after ‘Geetha Govindham’. The film has been made in four languages- Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada and will release on the same date in all the languages.
