<p>Kentucky’s seasonally adjusted preliminary February 2020 unemployment rate was 4.2 percent, according to the Kentucky Center for Statistics (KYSTATS), an agency within the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet (EWDC).</p>
<p>The preliminary February 2020 jobless rate was down 0.1 percentage points from January 2020 and unchanged from the 4.2 percent recorded for the state in February 2019. The U.S. seasonally adjusted jobless rate for February 2020 was 3.5 percent, down from 3.6 percent in January 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
<p>Labor force statistics, including the unemployment rate, are based upon estimates from the Current Population Survey of households. The survey is designed to measure trends in the number of people working, and includes jobs in agriculture and individuals who are self-employed.</p>
<p>Kentucky civilian labor force was 2,083,955 in February 2020, an decrease of 797 individuals from January 2020. The number of people employed in February rose by 1,498, while the number unemployed decreased by 2,295.</p>
<p>In a separate federal survey of business establishments that excludes jobs in agriculture and people who are self-employed, Kentucky’s seasonally adjusted nonfarm employment increased by 3,800 jobs in February 2020 compared to January 2020. Kentucky has added 12,900 jobs since February 2019, for a growth rate of 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>“As of February, Kentucky’s employment situation continued to improve with the addition of 3,800 jobs,” said University of Kentucky’s Center for Business and Economic Research (CBER) Interim Director Mike Clark, Ph.D. “While more people found work in recent months, growth in the state’s labor force has slowed.”</p>
<p>Nonfarm data is provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics program. According to the survey, eight of Kentucky’s 11 major nonfarm North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) job sectors had employment increases from the previous month and three declined.</p>
<p>The professional and business services sector added 2,300 jobs or 1.1 percent in February 2020. This sector was up 6,500 jobs since February 2019. The administration and support and waste management subsector accounted for most of this growth with a gain of 2,200 positions from January to February. The professional, scientific and technical services subsector was up 100 jobs in February and the management of companies subsector was unchanged.</p>
<p>“Employment levels in professional and business services have bounced around over the past few months,” noted Clark. “This could reflect greater use of temporary employees who provide firms the ability to adjust staffing levels quickly.”</p>
<p>Total employment in the government sector increased by 900 jobs from January 2020 to February 2020. Federal government employment decreased by 100 jobs; state government employment increased by 600 jobs; and local government employment increased by 400 jobs. Total government employment has declined by 100 jobs since February 2019.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s trade, transportation and utilities sector added 800 jobs in February 2020. Wholesale trade declined by 100 jobs; retail trade increased 700 jobs; and transportation, warehousing, and utilities increased by 200 jobs. Since February 2019, employment in this sector has decreased by 3,700 positions or 0.9 percent.</p>
<p>Construction firms added 400 jobs in February 2020. The construction sector was up 1,200 jobs or 1.5 percent from one month ago.</p>
<p>“Kentucky’s construction sector appears to have picked up over the past couple of months after declining last Fall,” said Clark.</p>
<p>Employment in Kentucky’s educational and health services sector increased by 300 jobs in February 2020. The health care and social assistance sector added 500 positions from January to February. The educational services subsector was down 200 jobs in February 2020. Since last February, the sector has grown by 6,600 positions or 2.3 percent.</p>
<p>Employment increased by 200 jobs in the other services sector from January 2020 to February 2020. This sector was up by 1,600 positions since February 2019. The other services sector includes repairs and maintenance, personal care services and religious organizations.</p>
<p>The financial activities sector gained 200 jobs in February 2020. These gains occurred entirely in the finance and insurance subsector. Employment in the real estate, rental and leasing subsector did not change from January to February. The sector was down 900 jobs compared to last February.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s manufacturing employers added 100 positions from January 2020 to February 2020. Employment in durable goods manufacturing declined by 100 jobs, while non-durable manufacturers added 200 jobs in February. Kentucky’s manufacturing employment decreased by 1,200 jobs since February 2019.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s mining and logging sector fell by 100 jobs from January 2020 to February 2020, and was down 2,000 jobs, or 18.5 percent, from a year ago.</p>
<p>Employment in the information services sector fell by 300 jobs in February 2020. This sector was down 1,200 positions from a year ago. The industries in this sector include traditional publishing as well as software publishing; motion pictures and broadcasting; and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Employment in Kentucky’s leisure and hospitality sector fell by 1,000 positions from January 2020 to February 2020. This sector is up 6,100 positions since February 2019. The accommodations and food services subsector lost 700 jobs from January to February. Employment in the arts, entertainment and recreation subsector decreased by 300 jobs.</p>
<p>Civilian labor force statistics include nonmilitary workers and unemployed Kentuckians who are actively seeking work. They do not include unemployed Kentuckians who have not looked for employment within the past four weeks.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s statewide unemployment rate and employment levels are seasonally adjusted. Employment statistics undergo sharp fluctuations due to seasonal events, such as weather changes, harvests, holidays and school openings and closings. Seasonal adjustments eliminate these influences and make it easier to observe statistical trends. However, due to the small sample size, county unemployment rates are not seasonally adjusted.</p>

<h3 id="a-record-33-million-americans-filed-for-unemployment-benefits-as-the-coronavirus-slams-economy">A record 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits as the coronavirus slams economy</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BzWx0MmNbJnc75s1d-X4-5QnhTw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/THCUYUTO2QI6VIKWABELMLG3KE.jpg" alt="img">
Laid off workers say they waited hours on the phone to apply for help. Websites in several states, including New York and Oregon, crashed because so many people were trying to apply at once.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“The most terrifying part about this is this is likely just the beginning of the layoffs,” said Martha Gimbel, a labor economist at Schmidt Futures.</p>
<p>The nation’s unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February, a half-century low, but that has likely risen already to 5.5 percent, according to calculations by Gimbel. The nation hasn’t seen that level of unemployment since 2015.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“We may well be in a recession,” said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in his first appearance on morning television on NBC’s “Today” show. “The first order of business is to get the virus under control and then resume economic activity.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Despite the ominous news about laid off workers, the stock market rose Thursday with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 400 points, or about 2 percent. Wall Street investors cheered the Senate’s massive government aid package. Investors are hopeful the federal cash for workers and companies will prevent the downturn from spiraling into a lengthy depression like the nation experienced in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Layoffs skyrocketed after President Trump declared that no more than 10 people should gather together at a time, effectively forcing restaurants and other public places to close. But many health experts say it is necessary to keep people home to slow the spread of the virus and prevent people from dying.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Both the scale of the layoffs and the speed at which they are happening are unprecedented. During the Great Recession, for example, the worst week for jobless claims was 665,000. Last week the nation saw five times that amount.</p>
<p>A lot of workers are not allowed to apply for unemployment benefits, meaning the true number of layoffs so far due to the coronavirus is likely far higher than 3.3 million. Self-employed workers, gig workers, undocumented workers, students, and people who worked fewer than six months last year are typically not eligible to apply for unemployment insurance in most states.</p>
<p>“I haven’t worked since March 13. I am not eligible for unemployment because I’m self-employed,” said Pam Massey, a hairdresser in Gig Harbor, Washington, about an hour south of Seattle. “I had to call my clients and cancel. What am I supposed to do?”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Massey is worried about paying her home mortgage. The salon owner also called her and said her rent is still due for her space at the salon, even though no one is getting a hair cut right now. Massey’s income has dropped to zero. Clients have been begging Massey to come to their homes to cut their hair, but at age 66, she felt the danger was too high.</p>
<p>The Senate’s coronavirus relief bill allows many more workers, including self employed workers like Massey, to apply for unemployment aid. The House is expected to pass the bill Friday and President Trump has indicated he will sign it quickly.</p>
<p>But there’s concern the money might not arrive fast enough. Many workers who have lost their jobs or had their hours severely cut back are worried about paying their April rent, car payment and health insurance costs.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“I worried about my mortgage. I’m trying to get ready for retirement. This is going to kill it,” said Massey.</p>
<p>The average unemployment benefit check is currently $385 a week, which is less than half the typical weekly paycheck in the United States. The amount is slated to rise an additional $600 a week once Trump signs the relief bill into law, a substantial increase meant to tide workers over as they are forced to stay home.</p>
<p>“My biggest concern right now is speed. These people who filed for unemployment may not get their checks in time to pay rent on April 1,” said Gimbel, the labor economist.</p>

<h3 id="israels-unemployment-rate-tops-21-percent">Israel’s unemployment rate tops 21 percent</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/03/F200326YS76-1024x640.jpg" alt="img">
Israel’s unemployment continued to climb rapidly amid the coronavirus crisis and as of Thursday evening 21.2 percent of workers in the country were out of a job.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of March, 723,028 people have been without work, 90% of them put on unpaid leave. In the past 24 hours 38,112 people have joined the ranks of the unemployed.</p>
<p>Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, unemployment in Israel was at a record low of under 4%. The total number of unemployed including those out of work prior to March now stands at 880,879.</p>

<p>Employment Service director general Rami Grauer said the service had already processed and handed over to the National Insurance Institute [the body that pays out the benefits] some 500,000 requests “so that the citizens of Israel will be able to receive the unemployment benefits they are entitled to as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Grauer said the Employment Service would complete the transfer of data of all those who registered for unemployment benefits by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Grauer said he expected the number of unemployed to reach as many as one million. Grauer said he expected around 20% of the newly unemployed would not have a job to go back to when the crisis ends and lockdown measures are eventually lifted.</p>
<p>While salaried workers are covered up to 75% of their earnings, Israel’s self-employed workers are not entitled to unemployment benefits. The government is working on a package that is expected to give some 175,000 self-employed a grant of up to NIS 6,000 ($1,675) with an average expected payment of NIS 4,300 ($1,200).</p>
<p>Finance Ministry Director General Shai Babad told the temporary Knesset Finance Committee Thursday that the ministry would be presenting a far-reaching economic plan to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later in the day. Babad said that if the measures the government has put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus lasted for 12 weeks, the budget deficit could rise to 11.8% and if a full lockdown was in place in that period it would skyrocket to as high as 15.5%.</p>
<p>But, Babad said, if conditions allow people to return to work after Passover, the budget deficit could be as low as 6.5%, while if in the interim a full closure was put in place the deficit would soar to 9.3 percent.</p>
<p>Despite the dire figures, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange ended the week on a positive note, bringing a close to a four-week losing streak.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv 35 index of major companies climbed 3% to end the week up 4.1%, while the Tel Aviv 125 Index was up 3.38% to close the week up 6.1%.
