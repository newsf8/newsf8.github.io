<p>Then there are those who mess up so badly they become political liabilities for Trump. This is a long list, but certainly includes acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly (who traveled to Guam to berate and insult Navy Capt. Brett Crozier for pleading for the safety of his sailors stricken by covid-19); former Environmental Protection Agency director Scott Pruitt; former interior secretary Ryan Zinke; former health and human services secretary Tom Price; former labor secretary Alexander Acosta (partially responsible for the slap on the wrist for the late child sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein); and a whole bunch of press secretaries and chiefs of staff. When their failures or ethics violations become too distracting, Trump eventually dumps them — but only after he and his sycophants in the media and Congress embarrass themselves by defending the malefactor.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Next come those who speak up and who defy (or threaten to defy) Trump’s reign of terror: former intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson (whose firing was “a decision that Trump acknowledged was in response to Atkinson’s having alerted lawmakers to the existence of a whistleblower complaint about the president’s dealings with Ukraine”); former national security staffer Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman; and, most recently, inspector general Glenn Fine, who had been charged with oversight of the $2 trillion stimulus package. (This comes as a New York Times report finds that Trump “has a small personal financial interest in Sanofi, the French drugmaker that makes Plaquenil, the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine,” the unproven treatment for covid-19 that Trump incessantly hawked.)</p>
<p>Fine was a respected career official, presently serving as acting inspector general for the Pentagon. Democrats and good government groups were livid. House Justice Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) released a blistering statement, which read in part: “This is unacceptable. Our system of government depends on the hard work of independent inspectors general who root out and expose waste, fraud, and abuse where they find it. President Trump may think he can use a national emergency as a pretext to line his own pockets or settle petty, personal scores. He is wrong.”</p>
<p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also blasted the action and vowed to continue congressional oversight:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The sudden removal and replacement of Acting Inspector General Fine is part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation by the President against independent overseers fulfilling their statutory and patriotic duties to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people. Since Day One, the President has tried to marginalize and exercise ultimate control over independent Inspectors General. Yet again, he is doubling down on his signing statement promise to disregard critical oversight provisions that hold the Administration accountable to the law. . . . We will continue to exercise our oversight to ensure that this historic investment of taxpayer dollars is being used wisely and efficiently to help workers and families.</p>
<p>Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics (another good performer who quit rather than serve a corrupt president), reacted on Twitter: “Trump preemptively removing an Inspector General is as clear an admission as you could hope to find that corruption will be the default setting for the $2 trillion bailout, just like it has been for everything else in this administration.”</p>
<p>Trump’s vow to “drain the swamp” was laughable. In his and his family’s self-dealing and conflicts of interest, in the hiring of supplicants, and in the ongoing search-and-destroy mission that removes truth-tellers, this president has attained another historic distinction: the most corrupt president with the most mediocre, sycophantic administration. Ever.</p>

We completely blew it for the first two months of our response. We were in a headless-chicken phase, and yes, it’s the president’s fault, it is not China’s fault. The head of the Chinese CDC was on the phone to Robert Redfield on Jan. 1, again on Jan. 8, and the two agencies were talking on Jan. 19. The Chinese had a test on Jan. 13; the Germans had a test on Jan. 16. We fiddled around for two months, we had a test on March 5 and it didn’t work. We didn’t have 10,000 people tested until March 15. So we lost two months there, and that was because of incompetent leadership at the CDC, I’m sorry to say — it’s a great agency, but it’s incompetently led, and I think Dr. Redfield should resign. And suppression from the top: I mean, the real coverup was the person in this country who was saying, you know, “This is not an important virus, the flu is worse, it’s all going to go away, it’s nothing.” And that encouraged everybody around him to say, “It’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing.” I had the same problem at the Times — I was trying to convince my editors, “This is really bad; this is a pandemic.” It took a while to get them, it took a while to get anybody to believe this. … Getting rid of Alex Azar was a mistake — he was actually leading a dramatic response and then … in February he was replaced with Mike Pence, who’s a sycophant.

<p><img src="https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/06/02/Britain_Trump_State_Visit_87452.jpg-552a8_c0-170-3978-2490_s1200x700.jpg?ffbd53b889ae0a4dbc9ab09c7b64effe61d05368" alt="img">
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Boris Johnson’s government is too “sycophantic” toward the Trump administration and that the U.K. needs to make clear it doesn’t share the U.S. president’s values.</p>
<p>“One of the things that concerns me is we are so obsessed with trying to please America that we act in a sycophantic way,” Mr. Khan, who is up for reelection in May, told Business Insider in an interview published Monday.</p>
<p>“What we should be doing is saying ‘you know what, your views on women I don’t agree with, your views on immigrants and Mexicans I don’t agree with, your views on Muslims I don’t agree with, your views on the LGBT+ community I don’t agree with,” he continued. “We need to be honest and say these aren’t the values that we are about.”</p>
<p>The U.K. should be more willing to “say boo to a goose and be honest,” he added. “In life generally, you often work with people you may not necessarily love and adore, but it’s about having a good and constructive relationship. That’s what we’ll need to do with the US and others.”</p>
<p>Mr. Khan made the comments Saturday in central London while discussing the Labour Party’s future leadership following Jeremy Corbyn’s defeat in December.</p>
<p>The first-term mayor, who became the first Muslim to be elected to the position, has had an ongoing public feud with President Trump ever since he criticized the president’s proposed travel ban again Muslim-majority countries in 2016. Mr. Trump has called Mr. Khan “ignorant” and a “stone-cold loser,” and the mayor has called the president “ill-informed” and a “poster boy for the far right.”</p>

It’s a really nice day. Sad not to be like going out and eating outside or inviting people over but sacrifices we make sense. It’s also really sad to not be able to go to church and do things like that. Really fun. But there will be other Easterners when it’s safer and better to do things like I met my husband just join the Chan you know how I feel about that. Can you keep people out of this. You know if they can even do maybe it’s too it is really pretty out that I could. I saw on Twitter that some people have snow today. Nice kitchen. Thank you very much. Matt one of the points of contention in our marriage is that I hate are extremely tiny galley kitchen and mats always like it’s a nice kitchen. So right now he’s quite successfully trolling me on that front. Yeah I know it’s spring so I’m in the white Maxi dress white Maxi dress gang at this point and you guessed it going to be like that even I’m in my house I would love to go on true and on I would really like to go on true and on and testing. And I have anything to add the thing that they haven’t got to it is they would like me I would like to go very much it is pulling the platform left the democratic platform not substantially. I don’t know. I wish it were. I wish I wish that it were. I’m not big on Cadbury eggs because you kind of bite in there. There’s just like a whole I mean I know people like that fondant but it’s just not it’s not me. I guess it’s too sweet and I didn’t. I don’t think of myself as being someone who complains about things being too sweet. Do you think Biden has a shot at taking Texas. Not really surprised knowing Texas like Trump quite a favorite day of bowling league. I do like Good Friday a lot. How do we abandon the two party system. I don’t know it’s a good question. I mean you know a lot of it has to do with ballot access and that’s really hard. My Amish. Yes it’s next question. Man ever thought about running for office in some capacity. I think Matt would be a fantastic candidate for office. I think he should run but I I think it would be very difficult to talk him into doing it. I think he likes being a behind the scenes operative. He did hold many student offices for example and participated otherwise in politics and in his time as a student activist. Do I believe in aliens. I wish there were aliens. I think that would be extremely cool. It’s Christian polling and it’s still a thing. It is still a thing. Failed to hold power for getting friends party entity. Thank you very much. I hope you guys are all having a blessed Good Friday as well. It’s kind of a difficult day for a lot of reasons. Next step for the American left. I don’t know I mean I think the American left’s you know there are lots of kind of down ballot and local races to focus on. I think that makes sense. You know there are a lot of candidates running in municipal offices and in state races and so forth. Could use less support and I think that’s where the left is going to be. For the time being age 24 is Green Knight film can’t wait. I look like and a single one. Well I am a but I’m a married one. What is the best thing about being a. I don’t know. I mean I guess sense of purpose and you know it’s lovely. It’s wonderful. I’m fond of it is it’s kind of a luxury. I mean I know that’s a little crazy. It’s difficult and it’s challenging. And at times kind of harrowing but also really nice. Weitz is thinking last summer when I would go to bed would sleep with my baby next to me and I always looked forward to going to bed with her next to me. The spirit luxuries which child is my favorite I love both my children very much. They’re very different. How involved are you in the new opinion series the America we need. I’m not involved in that very exciting new project on inequality but you should read should you get, whether it’s nice to see people put too much pressure on AMC to be perfect. Yeah I mean that happens with figureheads leaders of movements. Does Matt play video games. Matt he used to. He I remember the first time I saw Matt. I walked into our debate classroom in high school and he had his head directly down on a desk not on his arms or on his jacket or a hoodie or anything but he had his head flat on the desk and I assume this was like a troubled genius thing for a long time. Like he knows what a rebel. It’s what a troubled and brooding young man. So when I started dating him. He admitted that in fact, he had simply played Madden all summer in a very comfortable gaming chair and had lost next strength and therefore found it very painful to hold his head up when he came right back from school and therefore his head was straight down on his desk. Why more death rate in USA than any other country. I don’t know. Hi hi de rate in the United States. The area is taking measures a little bit on the elite side. How to stay optimistic. I wouldn’t stay optimistic. I’m certainly not optimistic. I think that the better question is how to continue living productively and happily while not being optimistic. I don’t know if any of you are the Lord of the Rings maybe but Gilad Arielle the elf queen has this lovely statement about how many years we have fought the long defeat and I think that’s generally how I try to approach things. There are victories in that periodically but I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s a good idea to especially hang your ability to live a happy and productive and fulfilled life on the expectation of short and medium term victories on the left or even on the side of what is morally good and right because that can be pretty disappointing. Good Friday is Good Friday is a day of mourning in a lot of ways and it’s just kind of a day that embodies the real difficulties and contradictions in Christianity that are meaningful and that give us strength. And those are that it’s a religion of great hope and faith. And at the same time religion of sacrifice quite a bit more. So a good day to kind of contemplate this those things in tension and also in conjunction with one another I do love Dorothy Day I do think the stock exchange should be closed on Good Friday thoughts on sleep training it’s difficult. It’s very hard and it’s very different kid to kid they’re all different in the way that they will or won’t sleep train. My favorite Easter Sunday dish I love deviled eggs I make deviled eggs myself all the time and I love making them out of colored Easter eggs I love the movie a man for all seasons I think that’s a great Thomas More wonderful movie great play it’s one I watched me make it a lot growing up actually I do read poetry and reading quite a bit of Mary Oliver lately I’m also a big fan of what’s the best thing someone can do to improve their writing. I don’t know the answer to that question if I did I would do it. My I guess my best tip to try to improve your writing is to read lots and lots of writers that you read and read and read and read the orb is a mapping. Right now you might hear some safari sounds when she wakes up. My favorite bird. I love dress. They’re beautiful tips on naming babies. I think when you go to name babies you know both parents should get to lay like some ground rules and then you find something within those that fit. So Matt had a one syllable rule but within that he didn’t have strong preferences. He didn’t have some weird suggestions. He likes the name fern and when he first came up with that I was like no Yeah we’re definitely not naming a poor child fern. Now I actually think it’s kind of cute. It grew on me but that’s how we did it. You know he would have this kind of basic ground rules. And I think both parents should have veto power because sometimes it just strikes you in a gut way we like to have more children. I think so. That would be wonderful. Now that I do have a favorite tree watch religious order in the church in this pond. I mean I like the Dominicans quite a bit older preachers my confessors a Dominican. I also like the Jesuits quite a bit like the Franciscans. There’s much to love right there is there’s so much to love in all the different religious orders, and their special personalities and terrorism. I have a piece coming out on some Dominican Friar sexual the house plants the house plants are dead. They died. They’re gone. It’s very sad. Yeah I I love the house plants. But after Claire was born I did not keep up with them well I know it’s very sad. Sorry fell by the wayside. I regret it maybe I’ll get some more of this spring there. It’s like a peace Lily at least. Favorite right wing thinker. Well I like Ross at the times read him quite a bit. Boss Ross it’s very interesting arguments. If the cost was zero what I send my kids to Catholic school would depend on the school. A lot of questions about the marijuana happening here. Well, if the story is out of yeast and you want to make bread you can always try making sourdough starter which is what everyone’s doing right now. Essentially use of wild yeast that’s floating around your place and try to seed starter that way. Bees are better than wasps. Spitzer pollinators are very important. Love cornbread big corn and bread. Fan Shoshana from girls. I don’t think that’s a good thing. But at least she got to hang out with driving. I love chocolate chip cookies. I have very strong views on chocolate chip cookies. I don’t like crispy ones except right around the edges. So my recipe, that I’ve messed with for years and years for chocolate chip cookies is very, very specific and it’s baked at a low temperature for a longer period of time and has this very specific composition of brown sugar at a weight that keeps them soft and chewy and almost kind of like fudge textured in the middle, which is what I prefer instead of crispy. I love whataburger big time. I’ve only got about 2. I like whatever attention what kind of music I like bad music. I mean that’s the thing I have great taste in music. I I’m always afraid of telling people the music I like. I had this experience with Matt where we were in the car and I was listening to Smashing Pumpkins and I was like really into it and grooving and Matt was like turn that off it’s awful. And that traumatized me. I accepted that it was awful and now I feel very embarrassed about my music taste. But yeah a bunch of 90s stuff like that I guess kind of pixies fan. There are a lot of shoegaze stuff that I like. I like slow dive quite a bit still. I do like whole quite a lot. And again feel like Matt on me. For that genre of music and that grunge shading into shoegaze stuff and now I’m a little bit embarrassed about it marriage tips. How I don’t know. I don’t know. I like being married a lot. I always thought that I would prefer that to dating and so forth and therefore married quite young. 23 when I got married and I married Matt who was my high school boyfriend. So I took a leap of faith that I wouldn’t like dating around. Just kind of skipped it. And Mary you know love grows and grows. I think you have to think of marriage as something that you committed to as an institution which in when experience about Texas beyond stereotype. Having never been I think that the landscapes of Texas are undersold as one of its great assets its unrivaled I think and natural beauty of course and a little bit biased, but go in the different seasons go to Central Texas go to hill country and then go down to Big Bend and see all the different aspects of it. You know Texas has these vastly different regions. There are plains and there are hills and then out west there is sort of Red Desert and mazes and these beautiful dry formations and then out east. There is Piney Woods shading into bayou as you get to the border with Louisiana down in the Gulf. There are beautiful beaches and and then you know just gorgeous gorgeous natural landscapes and the biggest blue sky you’ve ever seen. So I think you should give that a try. Mr. ever have doubts about your faith. No I don’t have doubts about the difficult. I mean it’s funny that you ask that. I have no problem believing that God exists and that all of the things that God says about himself and revelation tradition are true though things seem obviously and intuitively true to me the most difficult part I think is believing that God loves me. That’s the part that I struggle with. It’s not that he loves people generally I have an easy time believing that. But myths typically that can be very difficult feel like an exceptional person or an especially good person. How can god the Lord of the universe love something like me. That’s faith I guess. Take it on faith. I don’t know when I’m in lockdown. I hope not before it’s safe to do so perhaps when we have a vaccine. Have you ever been to India. Do I think coronavirus is our collective human conduct coming back on us. That’s certainly what the mad evils thought about the Black Death. I tend to think these things are more random than that. There have been plagues in every era of human existence. The way to think about rotavirus they think is the virus is just a little creature that’s doing its thing and we’re creatures that are doing our things and sometimes we get at cross purposes. And that’s unfortunate but it’s not because nature is punishing us or anything like that. It’s just natural. Other animals also die of nurses en masse at times and infections even trees become beset with illness and sometimes to extinction. And that’s unfortunate but no more that the dinosaurs were punished by their extinction. Will we be punished by ours when it happens. Right I don’t think so heckle debates. And it was formative. I have not read Caro’s brilliant series on LBJ kirkegaard. Yay Yeah. Tentative yay Kirkuk. I haven’t read the entire Corbett’s which is why it’s tentative. But what I’ve read I’ve liked vote by mail. Yes the thing about dinosaurs is that they were really evil. I mean they seem to have lived frightening lives in a lot of respects. I find it very hard to relate to the earth in the prehistoric period. I read once that when dinosaurs were around or at least during a certain phase of their lifetime there was no grass. Instead, the ground was generally covered with moss. And that struck me as terribly alien I think we did watch the Roosevelts docu series from PBS Matt watches nearly everything on PBS. What am I going to do the neo blatant solo guess soon. I hope one of these days I’ll get to all the solo cast that I would like to do. Would you say you’re someone who enjoys life. Yes tremendously. Before Trump had I ever heard anyone happy Good Friday before. Yes I had heard people say happy Good Friday. Quite a bit. I think people don’t really know what to say. And so even Christians know quite pious ones sometimes. We’ll see. Happy Friday. They want to acknowledge the occasion and give you that respect. But magnolia trees have to be pollinated by beetles because there were no bees when they first existed. That’s very fascinating and they’re quite beautiful. I love magnolia trees. I love magnolias in general. Pretty much anything with a magnolia print on it. Where of course I like florals in general this book on church history. Peter brown recently I think it was had a great book called through the eye of a needle on wealth in the church and I found that to be quite an accessible way into church history. Matt went by himself to Scandinavia but he had a lovely time. And I would love to go someday. There are many things I’d like to see. My favorite place in Texas. It’s a good question. I don’t know I mean it’s a place where I lived. And so you know the kind of things that people go to see I don’t think I really spent a lot at the Alamo and so forth. You know I like my hometown I like Sundance square in Fort Worth. I like walking around the bars all area in Fort Worth. I like Deep Ellum and Dallas. I just miss all of the places that were ordinary to me today study in college. I studied religion I studied at the University. I didn’t have a religion major which is just as well. But I went in two different majors English and sociology and focused on religion within those majors So I did a lot of religious literature and then I did the sociology of religion which essentially amounted to kind of track to major religion without it being possible favorite memories of Cambridge. Yeah so my favorite memory of Cambridge is that all winter it rained and rained and rained and rained and it was cold and it never got cold enough to snow or ice or do anything sort of scenic like that it just poured rain and seemed to get dark at like noon and was dark all the time and rainy all the time. And then one day in April I woke up and all of that rain had given rise to the most lush green grass and blooming roses and daisies and pansies and every tree and shrub and bush was in bloom. And this memorial garden to Princess Diana which was near where I lived was in bright bloom in the art of this college around the bend for me was in full bloom. And it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking to myself. So this is the English springtime of poetry right. This is what I’ve read about and done and Keats and it was just so romantic and so gorgeous I walked and walked for hours and hours and enjoyed it. From Europe with all due respect who are you. My name is Liz Bruning. I’m a writer for The New York Times. I vote on religion public morality and politics. I am quite far to the left for American politics. But for Europe I’m what you would know is like a normal Christian Social Democrat give a shout out to Texas Monthly and the Tribune. Yes all Texas publications that are working so hard to keep Texans not only updating them what’s going on right now. Virus but work hard around the clock to keep Texans updated on the news of the World and also to keep the really beautiful Texan literary tradition which is a very real and very rich and strong thing alive. I have my internal support. I love Texas Monthly I adore that publication I am a subscriber and there are several other Texas papers. Dallas Morning News Star Telegram which was my hometown paper in the Fort Worth Star Telegram. I lived in Arlington. The Houston Chronicle. And so on. I still follow I love them. Love Texas publications love Texas literature. Where are your parents lefties now. My parents are Trump guys. They have always been Republicans and my objective began. I love watching jack especially if I can get some people to play along with me. There is a left tradition in Texas. Absolutely and while Texas was heavily affected by the festival and so you did get quite a few people out of that who have a populist attending left politics to them and I don’t think that’s unheard of. My grandfather for instance was she grew up in the Dust Bowl. He was born in Childress Texas was deeply affected by the way the Dust Bowl impacted his family. They were itinerant farmers they moved around trying to grow their food. Then when he was 16, he joined the Air Force and wound up going to Korea and so forth and he was always an FDR Democrat. He never voted for Republicans he hated Reagan. He had a sort of anti-austerity politics. He wasn’t woke right. He was an older man from Texas who had lived a very rural life. But you know he was a he was a Democratic voter. He had that populist tradition. And so that does exist down there. How can we in Europe help the left in the USA don’t give up on us. I guess I keep reading our publications. My favorite period film. That’s a good question. I like Gary Linden quite a bit. He actually like quite a few period films. Honestly I find them extremely watchable what’s going on with medically as medically. It’s a really smart guy and I like his work and you know perhaps a bit cantankerous on Twitter but such could also be said of my matte. You know someone’s asking about John Wick and love John Wick love all this. There’s so many good period films. That’s a really nice question. Well there are lots of periods. There’s lots of in some sense like the ice storm is a period film rights about the 1970s. And I loved that film as well. New slick interface is struggling. Crazy Yeah. And know it’s I clear I’m hearing the awe. I haven’t seen focus. You guys keep asking about Lucas. I hadn’t seen it. I’ve seen you asked about last riffle. The thing is article first reformed which was good. How do I keep my frustrations and anger in check. I think a lot of angry thoughts. But you know what’s the point and can. Can you bring her here. I think the orb is settling down to nap Scorsese’s silence. I loved loved quite a bit and it’s a difficult watch. It’s kind of spiritual torture porn in certain respects but a fantastic novel and fantastic. I would highly recommend it especially during try to Ingmar Bergman states really love it when we see a democratic socialist when a non deeply district state. I don’t know I wish I could give you an answer on that. I would certainly feel better if I felt like I knew who was next up post. Bernie I don’t. I don’t know. I wish I knew. Wish we had a really deep bench of people who wanted those roles but I’m not sure. Sure that we do. I wrote a book. What would it be about. I would like to write a book on evil at some point but that’s going to be way on down the line because I have my hands full with regular work in these kids. What makes me angry. I mean a lot of things make me angry. Oh have I read and stuff. Yes I love Lisbeth. Fantastic would I ever run for political office. Thank you. Capitol hill TV. Not I would never run for political office. I have been someone who has covered people who are running for political office. It’s very, very, very difficult and very taxing and hard on your relationships and very, very risky for your family and finances. I if invited untrue anon I will happily go on my passion you know beauty. I think that’s what I’m always trying to get at. And the stuff that I report out. That’s what I’m interested the way that it manifests and gets tangled. I’ve driven through West Virginia. I mean I wasn’t driving, but I was in the car going through West Virginia and I thought it was beautiful. How do my views diverge from my parents. When I was in high school debate and so I was doing a lot of reading on my own and was just sort of convinced as a high school debate. You focus on sort of current events topics. Kevin my friend Kevin Werner has entered the chat room actually Kevin it has just gotten engaged. Kevin’s going to be a white guy soon. If we could get some congrats. Kevin’s going in the chat. Hello from New Orleans. I don’t know person from New Orleans. If you knew that I got married in New Orleans. I love New Orleans. It’s one of most safest cities in the United States. I adore New Orleans. I would love to go back sometime soon. I always go to New Orleans and end up having like six meals a day. How do I come up with column ideas. I have a big I have a big running Google doc or a dump. Evergreen ideas. But in general, they come right off the news. Have I ever been to Rhode Island. Yes well I lived there for a little bit because I was at Brown for my PhD program. And so I spent some time there and I thought it was quite lovely. I mean, I have a great affection for New England especially those cities in New England that feel a little bit nautical like fishing towns. They’re exotic to me. Having grown up in North Texas it’s quite quaint and quite lovely. Very very inspiring. Have I ever been to Georgia. Yes I also lived in Georgia for a little while as a child. We lived in Marietta. And one thing I think is underappreciated about Georgia is in terms of its natural beauty it has these fantastic Piney forests and sort of like granite cliffs in these hillsides and sort of dark woods for miles and miles. It’s very, very romantic and much more appellation than I would have been led to believe. I thought that it would be sort of green and hilly and sort of treeless and maybe that’s because I had seen movies like midnight in the Garden of Good evil which perhaps was not even shot on location. But if it was it was shot in Savannah and that’s a very different landscape than where I was in Georgia. But beautiful beautiful beautiful landscapes. The last time I cried and why that’s a good question. Sometimes I’ll cry out of frustration or stress. I can’t remember when that was go dogs are you a bad leftist for wishing Boris Johnson well. I mean, you don’t want people to die because they’re wrong. I don’t think being wrong about politics should be a death penalty event. So no I don’t think that’s my favorite Western state aside from Texas. Let’s see on the west coast I’d love California. I also like Las Vegas. I mean, it’s not a place where I would want to live. But you know it’s certainly it’s certainly fun to visit. I’ve been to Las Vegas. And in fact, when I was last in Vegas with Matt he was studying for the bar exam. So I always remember that because I would try to get him to go do things with me and he was like no I’m studying for the bar. He was just in a hotel room studying for the bar exam. When I go on. Joe right. Joe Rogan’s punk ass. Yeah sure. I would love to go into his biggest pet peeve when you call someone who you have a really bad connection. And like it’s not a critical phone call if they’re not telling you that your parent said heart attack or something but the connection is really bad. But they insist on still having a phone call instead of texting you or something like that that drives me nuts. I hate listening to it and not getting anything but you know let you get off the phone and they won’t agree to let you get on the phone. That’s terrible. Livestream seven liturgy I’ll probably just be putting some lines. Yeah that’s what I’ll be doing. What did I mean when I wrote that hope is a thorn in the side of doubt. Not a thing with feathers. I mean that hope is troubling a lot of people talk about hope as this thing that’s consoling or soothing. But I find it troubling because it’s very easy to be despairing and to be nihilistic. I mean it’s painful but it is a certain thing and it’s something that you can fully commit yourself to and hold on to but hope disrupts that and so hope can be very disruptive for that reason, instead of soothing it can be painful and difficult. That’s what I meant by how do we solve the problems and wish I knew the answer to that question. David Foster Wallace canceled million he seems to have been a complicated troubled individual. I don’t know. I don’t know if that should be a cancer level offense or what that should mean but that’s true. He was all of those things have I met Matt Stoller in person many, many times. Yes Matt still was lucky. I was at his wedding. He is great and I very much respect him. Good friend good guy person with a lot of integrity and principles. Three books that influence my religious formation. Well I guess since confessions and City of God would be a couple. I was reading a lot of like William Blake not that he would have agreed with my religious trajectory but certainly an important figure from the standpoint of sort of lovely mysticism Yeah we have. Also I have to I should think that we have some amazing folks coming up next week. If you would like to tune back in and get to know our New York Times columnists we have Michelle Cottle coming up Monday. Jamelle Buoy my colleague coming up on Tuesday. Kara Swisher Wednesday and Jennifer Finney Boylan. Coming up next Thursday and then Farhad Manjoo coming up Friday. So lots of opportunities to get to know my complex. The hardest part of my job I mean you know reporting is very time consuming and it’s a huge commitment and it can be quite difficult in terms of hear a lot of really hard stories and you develop close relationships with people and numb and then you can’t always help them. Which is really tough I saw the light house I thought it was wonderful. It was amazing. I loved it. I do work remote for the New York Times. Yes I don’t know if I would play anyone pickup basketball. I think I’d be pretty easy to dominate seeing as I’m four foot 11. I have quite a lot of editorial freedom in driving me on assignments. I’ve been very, very pleased with that very fortunate. Someone asked me earlier if I feel lucky and I do and being asked to non Ivy Leaguers have a chance to write for something like The New York Times I didn’t go to an Ivy League college. So yes I think so. Matt has written for the New York Times a few times and he went to the University of Oklahoma. So I think he you know I think that’s quite possible. Yes for sure. Yeah I mean equal pay. Someone asked do you feel like kept to code switch as a believer working in the mainstream. Yeah I mean, I think everybody you know who kind of speaks to two different or three or four or five whatever different constituencies has to find a way to talk to people that makes them feel listened to and respected and and heard but but still sort of gets the point across. Gary wills fan what is my riding routine. How long does each article take. Not long. I write very quickly. And there’s no routine because all the pieces are so different. But you know in general you you get the reporting down and then you work out of there. So we are at 45 minutes. I think that’s all the time we have for today. Thank you very much for shooting.

<h3 id="hannitys-latest-propaganda-actually-exposes-trumps-epic-failures">&ldquo;Hannity’s latest propaganda actually exposes Trump’s epic failures&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ALRQILDEU5A5TLF6M4VO74NQD4.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Hannity’s strategy, of course, is Trump’s strategy. Trump has already telegraphed that, however extensive the eventual coronavirus damage in American deaths and economic carnage, Trump will take credit for having kept it to that supposed minimum.</p>
<p>This requires memory-holing Trump’s catastrophic refusal to take coronavirus seriously for weeks and weeks, and instead substituting a narrative in which he acted decisively throughout.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Hannity displayed what this will look like with his broadcast on Tuesday night. Hannity and Trump talked about Trump’s decision to restrict travel from China as if it were a singularly decisive move. (This is an absurd exaggeration, but put that aside for now.)</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Importantly, during that banter — which also featured them bashing the media for refusing to recognize Trump’s brilliant leadership — Hannity scrolled a timeline of major actions by the government all throughout this crisis.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition created the propagandistic impression that all these acts demonstrated how seriously Trump took coronavirus all throughout. This deserves close attention, folks: It heralds the major media push that’s coming.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But it’s nonsense. What Hannity doesn’t tell you is that in many of the cases he himself cited, Trump directly resisted those efforts, publicly undercut them, or privately raged over them for the most nakedly corrupt of reasons.</p>
<p>Let’s go through it.</p>
<p>Trump ignored and undercut urgent warnings</p>
<p>First, Hannity’s timeline begins by citing numerous warnings that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued to the public early on about coronavirus.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But Hannity doesn’t tell you that Trump repeatedly and explicitly undercut the CDC’s efforts to create a sense of public urgency about the threat.</p>
<p>For instance, CDC officials had to actively work to reverse Trump’s downplaying of coronavirus. In February, after Trump claimed coronavirus would “miraculously” go away in the spring, CDC Director Robert Redfield contradicted Trump, noting it would remain “beyond this year.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Trump also actively contradicted CDC officials himself. After one declared it’s a “question of exactly when” coronavirus will spread, Trump disputed this, claiming: “I don’t think it’s inevitable.”</p>
<p>Trump even privately raged about the CDC’s public warnings because they were spooking the markets, which Trump views as key to his reelection chances.</p>
<p>Second, Hannity’s timeline cites two acts to show the administration’s decisiveness: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar’s declaration on Jan. 31 of a public health emergency, and Trump’s appointment of Vice President Pence as head of the response on Feb. 26th.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>What Hannity doesn’t tell you is that the internal dynamics involving both Azar and Pence actually showcased Trump’s refusal to treat coronavirus urgently — in a particularly vivid way.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>For instance, Azar tried to warn Trump to take coronavirus seriously as early as mid-January, but Trump’s aides “mocked and belittled Azar as alarmist” for doing so.</p>
<p>Trump’s appointment of Pence was actually part of an effort to marginalize the prescient Azar. And it came late. Until Pence was appointed, no White House official had been in charge of the response to coronavirus “until nearly two months after it began.”</p>
<p>Trump repeatedly and disastrously flouted experts</p>
<p>Comically, Hannity’s timeline also hails Trump’s announcement of 15 days of strict social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Similarly, Hannity’s timeline hails Trump for invoking the Defense Production Act, and extols Trump’s efforts on behalf New York. In fact, Trump utterly failed to fully deploy DPA in a manner that experts counseled would have prevented many problems now besetting the medical supply chain, which are leaving states and hospitals confused, scrambling and disastrously underequipped.</p>
<p>Finally, Hannity’s timeline notes Trump “mentioned” coronavirus in his February speech to Congress, as if that merits applause.</p>
<p>In fact, Trump’s reference was to his supposedly successful cooperation with China against it, in keeping with the line at the time that Trump, working with China, “shut it down,” as Trump put it. Amusingly, Hannity later abruptly pivoted in lockstep with Trump to blaming China for it.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>It should be stressed that Trump’s casual dismissiveness had extensive consequences, badly hampering the federal response. It helped produce disastrous delays in testing that created a “lost month” in which coronavirus spread out of control, and a failure by this “wartime president” to marshal private sector resources in time for coronavirus to swamp hospitals.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Hannity has unintentionally done us all a public service. He has reminded us just how vast the gulf was between many members of Trump’s administration, who did urgently want to take coronavirus seriously, and Trump, who serially and pathologically refused to do so.</p>
<p>AD</p>

<h3 id="column-trumps-absurd-parade-of-ceos-conceals-his-inaction-in-the-coronavirus-crisis">&ldquo;Column: Trump’s absurd parade of CEOs conceals his inaction in the coronavirus crisis&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/415605e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6048x3175+0+424/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F35%2Fb98e7cad41d39e94f95561df9789%2Fgettyimages-1207018646.jpg" alt="img">
President Trump has long been a master of what economist John Kenneth Galbraith called the “no-business meeting.”</p>
<p>These were occasions, Galbraith reported, in which Herbert Hoover would bring together leading industrialists and executives for solemn sessions with the president, photo opportunities, and then a turn before the microphone to assert their eagerness to help the nation out of its crisis.</p>
<p>Those who tuned in to Friday’s spectacle in the White House Rose Garden would recognize the same procedure, this time with a host of healthcare company and big-retailer executives, including the leaders of the drugstore companies CVS and Walgreens, drug companies Becton-Dickinson and Roche, retailers Target and Walmart and medical testing firms LabCorp and Quest.</p>
<p>Mr. President, you have forged a seamless partnership with every state and every territory in this country. Vice President Mike Pence sweet-talks President Trump on his flawed response to the coronavirus crisis</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>For the most part, the executives trumpeted steps that they would have taken or already have taken in the course of business. But they accepted the opportunity to give Trump credit for goading them into action, even though if anything he and his administration have been a hindrance.</p>
<p>LabCorp and Quest, for instance, between them had developed the capacity to deliver 3,000 tests for the novel coronavirus per day, making them the top private test administrators in the country even before Trump summoned their CEOs to Washington.</p>
<p>CVS and Walgreens hardly needed a federal say-so to build up inventories of healthcare supplies for virus patients, or to administer vaccines when they become available. (They both already can inoculate customers against the flu, shingles and pneumonia at their stores.)</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Trump’s goal in staging this pageant was to communicate to the public at large, and perhaps Wall Street in particular, that he finally has got his arms around the crisis. To some extent, the stunt may have worked. The stock market, waffling within the green most of the day Friday, soared during the news conference, closing with a gain of almost 10% across the board.</p>
<p>Trump continued to claim Friday that he began acting well in advance of the emergence of the crisis.</p>
<p>But Friday’s event only underscored how ill-prepared his government has been, and still is, to manage a major public health emergency. The idea that the U.S. government has to place so much responsibility in the hands of private enterprise is a reproach to Trump’s way of governing, such as it is.</p>
<p>The gap between Trump’s actions and his claims were evident on myriad levels. Given his position, he should be leading by example on proper social hygiene.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The speed of growth in U.S. coronacases cases is matching or exceeding those of other developed countries and will probably be seen to be higher when full-scale testing begins. (Johns Hopkins via Macleans)</p>
<p>His own administration’s coronavirus.gov website, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leads its advisories for keeping workplaces, commercial establishments and schools safe from the virus’s spread with the advice: “Stop handshaking – use other noncontact methods of greeting.”</p>
<p>Yet Trump stuck out his hand to every executive as they stepped from the microphones. Some took the bait, including Tom Moriarty, the representative from CVS Health. Others stepped away before having to grasp the proffered hand.</p>
<p>Only one that I could see responded by offering his elbow instead of his hand. (It was Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president at LHC group, a home healthcare firm.)</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>More important discordant notes were sounded. The sycophantic Vice President Mike Pence praised Trump as usual. “Mr. President, you have forged a seamless partnership with every state and every territory in this country” to fight the crisis, he said.</p>
<p>No assertion could be more absurd. Governors across the country have been pleading for days, even weeks, for Trump to declare a state of emergency to give them needed flexibility to deploy healthcare resources and unlock $40 billion in funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He resisted doing so until Friday.</p>
<p>The truth is that governors nationwide have had to take matters into their own hands because Trump has been missing in action.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>When individual governors voiced their displeasure at the federal dithering, Trump responded with bilious insults, calling Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, one of the hardest-hit states, a “snake” for criticizing the delay.</p>
<p>Seema Verma, Trump’s ideology-addled head of Medicare and Medicaid, thanked Trump for the emergency declaration, which she said would allow her to “suspend regulations that could get in the way of treating patients.”</p>

<p>Actually, as my colleague Noam Levey reported Friday, Verma has been an obstacle to exploiting the vast capabilities of Medicaid, the nation’s largest public health program. Verma’s agency hasn’t “taken the necessary steps to give states simple pathways to fully leverage the mammoth safety net program to prevent a wider epidemic,” Levey reported.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Verma’s well-documented hostility to Medicaid makes it harder for states to quickly sign up low-income patients for coverage so they can get necessary testing or treatment if they are exposed to coronavirus. Without that help, many poor patients will shun testing, complicating the government response to the crisis. Instead, Verma has spearheaded efforts to reduce Medicaid enrollments nationwide.</p>
<p>The boasting about America’s fight against the novel coronavirus is contradicted by every statistic generated by professionals. The trajectory of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is as fast or faster in the U.S. than what’s been experienced by the hotspot of Italy or France, Germany and Canada, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University — and its rate of spread in this country is surely understated vastly, due to the unacceptable shortage of test kits in the U.S.</p>
<p>The fact that Pence is still talking about having “hundreds of thousands of tests available and being processed with results to patients in the very near future” is an outright admission of failure, since a functioning government public health system would have had millions of tests available weeks ago.</p>
<p>The very notion that Trump is boasting about mobilizing America’s public and private resources should terrify every American. He hasn’t been on the job, and he’s still not showing that he knows what the job is.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Throughout his term, Trump has held “no-business” meetings to give his White House the veneer of activity. He’s held them with auto executives, pharmaceutical executives, and many others. They play their part by showing up on command, praising his wisdom and foresight, getting their pictures taken and expressing confidence in the future into the microphones.</p>
<p>Then they leave Washington and do what they please — have any of his meetings with drug companies yielded lower prices? Will Friday’s event have the same outcome? One hopes not, but that’s the way to bet.

<h3 id="mike-pence-and-the-farce-of-trusting-donald-trump-on-the-coronavirus">&ldquo;Mike Pence and the Farce of Trusting Donald Trump on the Coronavirus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e6aa22210b3ef0008717593/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ADS-MikePence.jpg" alt="img">
The weakness of Donald Trump’s response to the COVID-19 crisis—the weakness of Trump’s character—was captured in a response that Vice-President Mike Pence gave, on Thursday, to CNN’s Alisyn Camerota. She noted that, within hours of Trump’s address to the nation the previous night, the Administration had to issue “clarifications”: that the travel ban he had announced, which he said would apply to “Europe” except for the United Kingdom, cover a “tremendous amount of trade and cargo,” and have exemptions only for “Americans” who had undergone screening, would, in fact, not apply to cargo, cover only countries in the Schengen zone (a subset of European countries with limited border checks between them), and would also have exemptions for permanent residents and citizens’ immediate family members. Those are big clarifications. It was bad enough that Trump’s actions were entirely inadequate—he didn’t address problems with testing, for example. But it was stunning that he seemingly could not accurately explain his bad ideas. International financial markets began dropping as he spoke, and the inadequacy of his words and his Presidency became manifest. And so, Camerota asked Pence, “Why the confusion?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think there was confusion,” Pence replied, blankly, loyally, absurdly. “The President took another historic step, just like he did in January with China, to suspend all travel from Europe, Alisyn, for the next thirty days.” Instead of explaining the President’s confused remarks, Pence echoed them, adding to the muddle. Pence, it should be remembered, is not only the Vice-President but the nation’s dedicated coronavirus point man—his function is to coördinate and clarify and at least give the illusion of leadership. And yet it took another few sentences before he mentioned that there would be “Americans coming home”—so not a suspension of all travel—after being screened, followed by a reference to every returning “American and legal resident,” with a note that they would be asked to self-quarantine for fourteen days. But, a couple of minutes later, Pence again referred to “suspending all travel for thirty days from Europe.” Who coming from where is allowed or required to do what? The main thing to remember is that the President did something “historic.”</p>
<p>The incompetence and the sycophancy are connected. Pence delivers what Trump demands, even when Trump demands the pretense that COVID-19 will simply go away if people stop worrying about it. It won’t. It is not just that Trump doesn’t always have the very best people around him; he has too many people who seem to care only whether he is happy. Even people with great expertise spend too much time, at almost every public briefing, ritually noting his leadership. Such words are not confidence-inspiring. There have been reports that Pence at various points suggested that Trump take some practical actions—for example, in managing the plight of a cruise ship—and that Trump said no. Other officials have reportedly had similar experiences. But, as long as they do not publicly confront their boss or pressure him to take real action on a growing crisis, that only means so much. And Pence, for one, is not doing so; instead, he kept telling Camerota that what looked like haphazard moves were “all part of the President’s strategy,” extolling him as a leader who “took action.” But someone very prominent in the Administration or the Republican leadership has to get angry, in a way that is demonstrative, dramatic, and even, for whoever it is, out of character.</p>
<p>Instead, Pence is not alone. He is behaving in a way that Republicans have come to regard as normal. They must engage in the increasingly farcical exercise of praise for Trump. Sometimes, as when they join him onstage at a rally, the main immediate damage may be to their self-respect. At others, as in the impeachment hearings, when Republican after Republican claimed that the President was an innocent victim of the deep state, the damage was to their duty to the Constitution. During a pandemic, the harm is not only to public health but to the country’s structure, as fissures in the health and social-welfare systems widen, exposing just how vulnerable many Americans are—the hundred thousand homeless children in New York City’s public schools, for example—and a larger order breaks apart. (The damage may even be to their own health: Senators Lindsey Graham and Rick Scott are under self-quarantine, after mingling at a Mar-a-Lago event that included a Brazilian official who has now been confirmed as having COVID-19; Trump was also present but has so far neither been tested nor quarantined himself.) On Thursday, Senator Mitch McConnell, who has praised what he decided to call Trump’s “early, bold action” on COVID-19, reportedly had to be pressured to delay a Senate recess until a COVID-19 relief bill was passed. And among Fox News commentators, as Dylan Byers notes, there is still outrage that some virus has the nerve to undermine Trump. Pence, speaking to Camerota, tried to pin the blame on Europe, which he said was the site of most new cases. What will he say when America wins that title?</p>
<p>One of the most mangled sections of Pence’s interview had to do with testing. He suggested that anyone who needed a test could get one just by going to a doctor, who would arrange one—or maybe that would happen soon, if not yet. When Camerota showed him figures suggesting that the number of tests completed was still just in the thousands, he said he thought that the information was wrong. But he refused to even estimate the right number. The mismanagement of testing, particularly as coronavirus was just reaching the United States, appears to have triggered a disaster. It remains shockingly hard for people to get tested—test kits and the chemical reagents needed for them are a scarce resource—even when they have symptoms and known contact with COVID-19 patients. According to the COVID Tracking Project, in which The Atlantic is a partner, the tally of tests completed was nearing sixteen thousand five hundred on Friday; South Korea has conducted more than ten times as many. “It is a failing. Let’s admit it,” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, of the U.S.’s testing system, at a hearing of the House Oversight Committee. Trump will never admit it.</p>
<p>The testing situation is such a shambles that even some Republicans have begun to acknowledge it. Senator Lamar Alexander called it “a serious deficiency,” according to Politico, and Senator James Lankford said that the idea that people could simply go and get tested—which Trump has pushed—was just wrong. Senator Mitt Romney (who might actually be good at managing this sort of thing) said that the situation is “frustrating.” The question is whether that consciousness of failure will lead to a breaking point in the Republicans’ system of obedience to Trump. This is not a matter of using the coronavirus crisis to bring him down; it’s a question of the President’s party really pushing him to do what he can to stop the virus from bringing the country down. And if he won’t, they can start voting with Democrats in Congress, and give support to governors and other local officials—and, most fundamentally, they can be honest with the public. Perhaps Republicans could even nominate someone else at the convention this August (if, given the fears of COVID-19, it’s still held). That seems far-fetched, but so, a month ago, did trading being halted on the New York Stock Exchange, campuses closing, Broadway shutting down, major-league seasons getting suspended, and parts of the city of New Rochelle being cordoned off. Unimaginable scenes at overwhelmed hospitals may be ahead.
