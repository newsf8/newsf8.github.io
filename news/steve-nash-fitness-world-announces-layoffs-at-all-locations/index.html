<p>One of British Columbia’s largest fitness providers has terminated all of its team members.</p>

<p>“The indefinite closure of our clubs… due to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many difficult decisions for the company,” the letter states.</p>
<p>“While the company has explored all options to continue operations and protect our team members continued employment, we do not see a way forward at this time.”</p>
<p>In a public social media post about the chain’s closures last week, SNFW Fitness B.C. president and CEO Chris Smith said that all team members would be paid during the first two weeks of the shutdown to lessen workers’ financial burden.</p>
<p>In a letter dated March 24, the company noted that more information regarding final pay has yet to come.
