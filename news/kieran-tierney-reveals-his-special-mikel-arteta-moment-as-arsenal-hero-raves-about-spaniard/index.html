<p>Jubilant Kieran Tierney has paid tribute to Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta after the Gunners&rsquo; FA Cup glory win over Chelsea.</p>
<p>The former Celtic star was a key man once again in the 2-1 victory at Wembley as the £25m left-back continued his rich vein of form since lockdown,</p>
<p>The Scotland international had nothing but kind words for the Spaniard as he admitted the pair enjoyed an emotional exchange at the full-time whistle.</p>
<p>And the 23-year-old is certain the gutsy win over Frank Lampard&rsquo;s side is just the start of another trophy era for Arsenal.</p>
<p>He said: “It’s been so high and so low at different times but everyone at the club and the fans have been brilliant with me since I came in and this one is for them.</p>
<p>“It’s brilliant. It’s been the toughest year of my life and I couldn’t have picked a better ending for the season and there’s so many people I want to thank… my family, my friends and the manager for putting his trust in me and I shared a moment with him at the end.</p>
<p>“The manager has had a big impact on this squad. We’re building something, going somewhere and we’re improving.</p>
<p>(Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a process and we will have some bad results and ups and downs but we all trust in this process 110 per cent.</p>
<p>“The best is yet to come from the team. We’re building something here. I’ve been saying that after lockdown. After the Man City defeat, we’ve made progress. People can see we’re building something and getting somewhere.</p>
<p>“There’s no better feeling that winning trophies. It’s been a rollercoaster here but to finish it like this is just brilliant.”

<h3 id="kieran-tierneys-games-per-trophy-record-after-winning-fa-cup-with-arsenal-is-incredible">&ldquo;Kieran Tierney&rsquo;s games-per-trophy record after winning FA Cup with Arsenal is incredible&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gmsrp.cachefly.net/images/20/08/02/6221fa0b36c15b3ae0a41d3cbe958748/1200.jpg" alt="img">
Kieran Tierney already looks like a £25m bargain.</p>
<p>After an injury-laden start to his Arsenal career, the Scotsman has come into his own in recent weeks after the Premier League&rsquo;s restart back in June.</p>
<p>The no-nonsense defender has been a revelation for the Gunners of late and played a starring role against Chelsea in the FA Cup final yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Operating as a third centre-back, Tierney was far and away the best defender on the pitch and even played the pass to set Pierre-Emeirck Aubameyang away before he was fouled by Cesar Azpilicueta in the area.</p>
<p>Without the 23-year-old Scotsman in defence, you can bet your bottom dollar that Chelsea&rsquo;s attack would have had far more joy at Wembley.</p>
<p>Luckily for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal, Tierney will be at the Emirates for the foreseeable future and victory in the FA Cup final secured the 12th trophy of the defender&rsquo;s young career.</p>
<p>Amazingly, that now means the former Celtic left-back average a trophy every 16.2 games, with his 12 triumphs coming in just 194 appearances.</p>
<p>Absolutely incredible. After the victory over Chelsea, Tierney reflected on what he referred to as &lsquo;the toughest year of his life&rsquo; after leaving his boyhood club last summer.</p>
<p>He said, per Mirror: “It’s been so high and so low at different times but everyone at the club and the fans have been brilliant with me since I came in and this one is for them.</p>
<p>“It’s brilliant. It’s been the toughest year of my life and I couldn’t have picked a better ending for the season and there’s so many people I want to thank my family, my friends and the manager for putting his trust in me and I shared a moment with him at the end.</p>
<p>“The manager has had a big impact on this squad. We’re building something, going somewhere and we’re improving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a process and we will have some bad results and ups and downs but we all trust in this process 110 per cent.</p>
<p>“The best is yet to come from the team. We’re building something here. I’ve been saying that after lockdown. After the Man City defeat, we’ve made progress. People can see we’re building something and getting somewhere.</p>
<p>“There’s no better feeling that winning trophies. It’s been a rollercoaster here but to finish it like this is just brilliant.”</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason Arteta loves the Scotsman, a future Arsenal legend in the making.</p>

KIERAN TIERNEY has notched his first Premier League goal for Arsenal against a doomed Watford side hurtling towards relegation.</p>
<p>The Gunners tweeted their appreciation for the boyhood Celtic fan after his goal, posting: “KT THE BHOY!”</p>
<p>1 Arsenal star Kieran Tierney celebrates with his team-mates after scoring</p>
<p>Ex-Hoops star Tierney has rubber-stamped his position as one of the in-form players in the division and a goal to add to his impressive defensive displays will only heighten that.</p>
<p>Nicolas Pepe’s left-wing cross found Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the back post.</p>
<p>The Gabon international’s first touch took him away from goal which allowed him to lay the ball into Tierney’s path with his second and the Scotland international finished calmly with his left foot, sweeping the ball past a flat-footed Ben Foster into the far post from 16 yards.</p>
<p>It was the Gunners&rsquo; second goal of the game after Aubameyang himself notched an early penalty after VAR deemed Craig Dawson’s barge on Alexandre Lacazette to be a foul.</p>

<p>Tierney was earlier compared to Ashley Cole, with former Gunners boss Terry Neill praising the 23-year-old as the best full-back the Emirates club have had in 15 years.</p>
<p>He said: “He’s been brilliant for us. The more I see him, the more I like him.</p>
<p>“Ashley Cole was superb for us when he joined in 2006.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But although it’s still early days with Kieran, there’s a feeling he can go on to great things.</p>
<p>“Let’s not forget, he’s only 23, so he has time on his side.</p>
<p>“Every time I see him, he’s better than the time before and there’s even more to come.</p>
<p>“He comes across as a well-grounded individual with mental strength. He’s clearly been well-schooled at Celtic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kieran could have stayed at Celtic, especially with them going for ten in a row, but he clearly wanted to test himself. That shows ambition.</p>
<p>“That £25million Arsenal paid Celtic for him is looking like an absolute steal.</p>
<p>“Full-backs are expected to bomb forward and get crosses in, but a lot of them can’t do the basics of defending. Tierney can.</p>
<p>“He is an excellent all-round footballer.”</p>

<p>Former Celtic star Kieran Tierney has scored his first goal for Arsenal on the final day of the season.</p>
<p>Tierney&rsquo;s 24th-minute strike against relegation threatened Watford gave the Gunners a 2-0 lead as his first campaign at the London club draws to a close.</p>
<p>The left-back side-footed the ball goalwards but it did take a slight deflection off Hornets midfielder Will Hughes before finding the bottom corner.</p>
<p>Tierney moved to Arsenal in August 2019 for a £25million fee, the highest Celtic have received for a player.</p>
<p>Injury struggles delayed his long awaited debut before a dislocated shoulder further threatened to derail his career down south.</p>
<p>(Image: Offside via Getty Images)</p>
<p>But he has impressed since English football restarted after the Covid-19 lockdown, particularly in the club&rsquo;s run to the FA Cup final in which they will meet London rivals Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mikel Arteta&rsquo;s club are set to finish in the top half of the Premier League but will miss out on European football after a poor start to the season.</p>
<p>It comes as Gunners legend Terry Neill talked up Tierney as the club&rsquo;s best left-back since Ashley Cole.</p>
<p>Neill said: “Tierney has been brilliant for us and the more I see him, the more I like him.</p>
<p>“He comes across as a level-headed young lad, very self-effacing and that’s surely down to his family</p>
<p>and friends and the way he was brought up.</p>
<p>“Ashley Cole was superb. He was a great player and it’s obviously still early days with Kieran but, from what I’ve seen so far, I’ve been immensely impressed by him.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry&rsquo; - Tierney apologises for Arsenal joke and vows to send jersey to fan battling cancer</p>
<p>The Scottish defender was quick to stress he meant no offence by his gesture and made amends with a quality offering</p>
<p>left-back Kieran Tierney took to social media to apologise after a picture was shared online of him putting his middle finger up following the club&rsquo;s 2-0 win over .</p>
<p>The now deleted picture showed the the entire squad celebrating with fans on Twitter quick to spot and point out Tierney&rsquo;s gesture.</p>
<p>Tierney, 23, has struggled with injury since joining the Gunners from in 2019 and seemed to acknowledge his joke may not have gone down too well with everyone online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn’t realise this was getting posted,&rdquo; Tierney said on Twitter in reference to the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was a joke with the kitman. I’m so sorry if it caused anyone offence - wasn’t meant in anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>— Kieran Tierney (@kierantierney1) July 18, 2020</p>
<p>Thankfully for Tierney, most fans weren&rsquo;t offended, with one that is currently battling cancer seeing the lighter side of the joke.</p>
<p>Tierney was quick to acknowledge the Gunners supporter, urging him to keep fighting and promising to send him his Arsenal jersey worn in the club&rsquo;s 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday.</p>
<p>— Kieran Tierney (@kierantierney1) July 18, 2020</p>
<p>The Scottish defender was a class act on and off the pitch on Saturday as he starred in the club&rsquo;s semi-final win.</p>
<p>Along with the clean sheet, Tierney claimed the assist for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang&rsquo;s second goal with a fantastic pass, and is hopeful the Gunners can now kick on to bigger and better things moving forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was tough, we knew we would have less of the ball against City and you have to take your chances when you get them. Aubameyang does what he does,&rdquo; Tierney told BBC&rsquo;s Match of the Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to suffer together in games like this, When we get the ball we have to play well but we know we will have 5-10 minute spells when we won&rsquo;t see the ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aubameyang has done it for so long, it&rsquo;s an honour for me to play with him. That ball I played isn&rsquo;t a goal-scoring ball but he makes it one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are building for something big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arsenal will now face either or in the FA Cup final next month at Wembley, where a win for the Gunners would guarantee their place in the next season.

Mikel Arteta has experimented with deploying Kieran Tierney at centre back for Saturday&rsquo;s FA Cup final at Wembley.</p>
<p>Arsenal manager Arteta, who is also considering a start for Ainsley Maitland-Niles, has a selection headache in central defence for Saturday&rsquo;s clash against London rivals Chelsea with Shkodran Mustafi, Pablo Mari and Calum Chambers all injured.</p>
<p>The Gunners are expected to play with three central defenders, with David Luiz and Rob Holding set to start.</p>
<p>Kieran Tierney could play at centre back for Arsenal during the FA Cup final against Chelsea</p>
<p>The only other available recognised centre back is Sokratis but he is clearly out of favour with Arteta, having played just one minute since the restart.</p>
<p>That has left the Gunners boss considering the option of using left back Tierney as a central defender against Chelsea in what is unarguably the biggest day of Arteta’s fledgling managerial career so far.</p>
<p>Tierney has briefly appeared in the role for Arsenal since the resumption in June but such a move would represent a huge gamble in a Cup final.</p>
<p>Mikel Arteta has a defensive selection headache heading into the Wembley showdown</p>
<p>It is understood that, in training this week, Arteta explored the option of Tierney playing on the left side of a back three with Maitland-Niles at left wing-back.</p>
<p>Fellow left-sided defender Sead Kolasinac is fit and has also played as an emergency central defender during Project Restart, an option which could allow Tierney to play in his usual role.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brighton are interested in signing Maitland-Niles before next season. The former England Under 21 star is pondering his future as he looks to secure regular first-team football.
