Gov. Gretchen Whitmer suggested Friday that a growing rift with the White House is affecting shipments of medical supplies to Michigan amid exponential growth in confirmed coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the federal government told us that we needed to go it ourselves, we started procuring every item we could get our hands on,&rdquo; Whitmer said Friday on WWJ 950AM. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve gotten back is that vendors with whom we had contracts are now being told not to send stuff here to Michigan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitmer didn&rsquo;t say who has told vendors to stop sending medical supplies to the state, but strongly implied the order came from President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s office could not provide any additional information Friday afternoon substantiating Whitmer&rsquo;s allegation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really concerning,&rdquo; Whitmer said Friday morning on WWJ. &ldquo;I reached out to the White House, asked for a phone call with the president, ironically at the same time that all of this other stuff was going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump called into Sean Hannity&rsquo;s Fox News program Thursday night and bashed Whitmer&rsquo;s handling of the coronavirus public health crisis that has claimed the lives of 92 Michigan residents as of Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your governor of Michigan, I mean, she&rsquo;s not stepping up,&rdquo; Trump said, who referred to Whitmer as &ldquo;a woman governor&rdquo; and not by her name. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if she knows what&rsquo;s going on, but all she does is sit there and blame the federal government. She doesn&rsquo;t get it done. And we send her a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitmer has made public pleas for days that the federal government has been slow to send medical supplies from its national strategic stockpile.</p>
<p>On Monday, Whitmer said one unnamed hospital received a shipment last weekend from the federal government of 747 N95 protective masks, 204 gowns, 40,467 gloves and 64 face shields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the exception of the gloves, that allotment of PPE didn&rsquo;t cover one shift,&rdquo; Whitmer said Thursday.</p>
<p>Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown confirmed Friday to Crain&rsquo;s that the state needs 400,000 N95 protective medical masks each day for the next several weeks to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>Whitmer did not specify in the radio interview Friday which vendors or specific medical equipment is being blocked by federal authorities from being sent to Michigan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact of the matter remains, we need help and at the very least we don&rsquo;t need people standing in our way from getting,&rdquo; Whitmer told WWJ. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working incredibly hard. But these are serious times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crain&rsquo;s sought clarity from Whitmer&rsquo;s office midday Friday and the names of vendors under contract that the governor referenced. Whitmer&rsquo;s spokeswoman had no additional information.</p>
<p>Whitmer, a Democrat, said she&rsquo;s not trying to engage in a political feud with the Republican president.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the doctors and nurses who are wearing one mask for the whole shift, who are worried about their own personal health but are still treating the sick and the fragile, it&rsquo;s crucial that everyone does their part,&rdquo; Whitmer said. &ldquo;That includes individuals staying homes, it includes businesses that can help manufacture this (personal protection equipment) that there&rsquo;s too little of and it includes the federal government who we need partnership from.&rdquo;

Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined News 10 via Skype on Thursday. News 10&rsquo;s Ann Emmerich talked with Governor Whitmer about the status of the coronavirus in Michigan, as well as the steps she is taking to help hospitals cope with the added pressures of the virus.

<h3 id="stay-at-home-michigan-gov-gretchen-whitmer-says-as-coronavirus-cases-soar">Stay at home, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says as coronavirus cases soar</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bridgemi.com/sites/default/files/hero_images/whitmer-newsconference.jpg" alt="img">
“I would anticipate that there would be fines associated with not doing that, and they will be shut,” she said. “We have a moment to stem the crisis that we see unfolding before us, and it’s going to take all of us to take this action seriously.:”</p>
<p>The order allows residents to leave the home for outdoor activity, including walking, hiking, running and biking, provided they maintain a 6-foot distance from one another.</p>
<p>Whitmer made clear that pharmacies and other important businesses will not close, and restaurants can continue with carry-out and delivery orders.</p>
<p>“Your grocery stores will be open,” Whitmer said. “I have checked on our whole supply chain for food, and it will be accessible. Do not panic. Do not hoard.”</p>
<p>The order comes as Michigan’s coronavirus case count continues to rise. As of Monday morning, there were 1,232 confirmed cases and 15 known deaths in the state, according to Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do nothing, very rough models estimate that the number of cases in Michigan could increase five-fold in the next week,&rdquo; Khaldun said. &ldquo;We are acting right now to decrease that number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“The current trajectory that we&rsquo;re on looks a lot like Italy,” Whitmer said, referencing the European hotspot with more than 53,000 cases and 4,827 deaths as of Sunday.</p>
<p>The order reflects recommendations from Michigan business groups, whose leaders urged against overly broad action and spent the weekend discussing the parameters of a stay-home mandate with the Whitmer administration, said Rich Studely, president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Governors in at least eight states had already adopted some form of a shelter in place order, and some of the early orders were &ldquo;blunt instruments&rdquo; adopted out of necessity, Studley said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think one of the things that&rsquo;s helpful to the governor and our state is that, as challenging as the situation is here in Michigan, we&rsquo;ve had the ability to learn from governors in states on the west coast and east coast where the coronavirus hit earlier and has been more severe,&rdquo; Studley said.</p>
<p>Weekend conversations between business groups and the Whitmer administration included how to define essential industries that should be exempt from the order and how quickly certain businesses would be able to shut down in a safe fashion, Studley said.</p>
<p>The chamber of commerce will urge members to &ldquo;fully comply,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sandy Baruah, CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber, said business’ ability to self-designate their supply chain and non-essential businesses’ ability to designate critical employees will allow basic operations to continue and may make it easier for the economy to rebound once the crisis is over.</p>
<p>Brian Calley, president of the Small Business Association of Michigan, said the provisions that help businesses continue basic functions.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t compromise [the public health response,] it makes it stronger,” he said. For example, a payroll company ensuring people continue to get paid in multiple industries, “that’s an enhancement. That protects the public health and ensures that there’s not undue disruptions to the things that still have to happen.”</p>
<p>The order uses federal guidelines to identify critical infrastructure workers exempt from the stay-home mandate, including those in health care and public health, law enforcement, food and agriculture, energy, water, transportation, &ldquo;critical manufacturing&rdquo; and chemical supply chains.</p>
<p>Michigan is also exempting workers in areas like child care and certain suppliers or distributors that serve critical industries.</p>
