MAX VON SYDOW, star of more than 160 films and TV shows, has died aged 90. The Swedish-born actor (pictured), who became a French citizen in 2002, died on Sunday in France. He was known as a priest in The Exorcist and a knight in Ingmar Bergman’s art house classic The Seventh Seal. He also starred in 1994’s Judge Dredd and as the Three-Eyed Raven in Game of Thrones.

Inflatable blast hurled girl of 3 ‘40ft to death’

A THREE-YEAR-OLD girl died after being thrown ‘as high as a house’ when an inflatable trampoline exploded, an inquest heard. Ava-May Littleboy was on the beach with her family when there was a sound like ‘a cannon’ and she ‘flipped five or six times’. She died of head injuries after crashing to the ground at Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk, in July 2018. A witness said Ava-May, of Lower Somersham, Suffolk, had been hurled 40ft into the air. The Norwich inquest, which continues, will hear evidence of Johnsons Funfair Ltd’s working practices.

PC murder trial jurors told to be ‘clear-sighted’

JURORS in the trial of three teenagers for the murder of PC Andrew Harper have been told to set aside the emotion of the case. Pc Harper died after he was dragged behind a car while responding to the reported theft of a quad bike near Sulhamstead, Berkshire, last August. Henry Long, 18, of Mortimer, Reading, and two 17-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all deny murder. Mr Justice Edis asked jurors, who were selected yesterday, to be ‘clear-sighted’. The prosecution’s case opens today.

Cracking plan, but Boris bridge ‘just won’t work’

BORIS JOHNSON’S idea to build a bridge across the Irish Sea has been roundly dismissed by a think-tank. The project — which reportedly could cost £20billion — should not be a priority, said the Fraser of Allander Institute, based at Strathclyde university. It said: ‘It won’t deliver the economic boost some claim, it would go to the wrong location, it wouldn’t be consistent with climate change objectives and money could be better spent on other things. Apart from that, it’s a cracking idea.’

Coin-size pancake tortoise is a change for the batter

THIS tiny pancake tortoise is a flipping wonder — the size of a £1 coin — it’s the first baby born to a breeding pair at Wiltshire’s Longleat Safari Park. It has yet to be named as it is too small to determine its sex. The critically endangered pancake species, named for its flattened shell, is the world’s fastest tortoise and can reach 5mph.

‘Slimming pills’ dealer jailed again for manslaughter

AN ONLINE dealer has been found guilty for a second time of killing a woman who took toxic tablets marketed as slimming pills. Bernard Rebelo, 32, from Gosport, Hampshire, was jailed for seven years in 2018 for the manslaughter of ‘troubled’ Eloise Parry, 21, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, who was sold eight pills with poisonous Dinitrophenol. An Old Bailey jury convicted him a second time jury after the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial. He is due to be sentenced today.

Yet more rain brings new flood warnings

AN AMBER ‘potential threat to life’ flood warning was issued for parts of mid and north Wales, with 3.5in of rain expected to fall on saturated ground yesterday and today. A less severe yellow warning was given for parts of northern England including Leeds and Bradford.

Grenfell architects were ‘misled over insulation’

ARCHITECTS refurbishing Grenfell Tower said they were deliberately misled by salesmen who sold them flammable insulation. Neil Crawford, project manager of architect Studio E, told the inquiry into the fire that sales literature used by manufacturer Celotex exploited their limited understanding of information about its RS5000 insulation. Combined with Reynobond PE panels, the insulation made up the external cladding system, which was a key factor in the fire’s rapid spread by acting as a fuel source. Mr Crawford said of the sales tactics: ‘It’s deliberately misleading. It’s masquerading horse meat as beef lasagne and people bought it.’ The inquiry is continuing.

Primary school closed for cleaning in typhoid alert

A PRIMARY school has been closed after a child was confirmed to have typhoid. Whitmore Park School in Coventry was shut yesterday while a deep clean was carried out. Public Health England confirmed a single case of the infection, adding it was ‘travel-related’, with final test results awaited for a second child. Headteacher Jacqueline McGibney, who expected to reopen the school today, said: ‘We take the health of our pupils and staff very seriously.’

Doctor Few… audience slumps to 15-year low

DOCTOR Who has slumped to its lowest TV ratings since the show’s revival in 2005. Last week’s series finale, starring Jodie Whittaker as the Time Lord, was seen by just 4.6million, Barb figures show.

Prostate cancer test could reduce biopsies

A urine test could help men to avoid an unnecessary initial biopsy for prostate cancer. The procedure is normally used to test for the most common cancer in British men, along with MRI scans, physical examinations and blood tests. Now University of East Anglia researchers have found a way to identify biomarkers for the disease by combining data from two components in urine — which could reduce the need for biopsies by around 60 per cent in five years. But the method is still in ‘very early days’, researcher Dr Daniel Brewer warned.

No sweat! Deodorant on the run a top time-saver

SPRAYING on deodorant, styling hair and applying make-up on the way to work are among ‘time hacks’ used by busy millennials, a new survey shows. The most common ‘task fusion’ is checking emails over breakfast, which 70 per cent of 24- to 35-year-olds do to save an average of ten minutes a day. Other tricks include going to bed in gym gear to be ready for a morning workout, and brushing teeth in the shower. Doing all of the top ten hacks saves 1hr 49min a day, calculated Kellogg’s, which carried out the poll.

Family in ‘SOS on beach’ were just having a row

RESCUERS who responded to reports of people struggling in the sea found a heated family argument in progress. A helicopter, three lifeboats and emergency teams were sent to the beach in Minehead, Somerset, on Friday. They found one person wading in the sea and the rest, who were staying at Butlins, embroiled in a row on the beach. The operation is believed to have cost £2,000 but the RNLI’s Chris Rundle said: ‘When there is a report of persons in the water, no one can afford to take any chances.’

NEWS BITES

■ CRABS’ ability to camouflage themselves is harmed by noise from ships, University of Exeter researchers found. The stress stops them changing colour to match their surroundings, leaving them vulnerable to predators.

■ SQUATTING or kneeling may be better for us because both require more activity than sitting, US researchers say. They studied the Hazda people in Tanzania who use ‘active rest postures’ and lack the markers of chronic diseases linked with long periods of sitting.

■ A LANDOWNER shot an otter in the head with a rifle after it got caught in a net on his lake in Cerne Abbas, Dorset. Stuart Jones, 54, of Chilthorne Domer, in Somerset, was jailed for two months. He pleaded guilty to killing a protected species.

■ WEARING clothes can shed more microfibres than washing them, a UK and Italian study found. One person releases nearly 300million fibres from washing their polyester garments each year — and more than 900million by wearing them.

■ BEADS made from ostrich eggs ‘acted like Stone Age versions of Twitter likes’, a US study found. The jewellery was swapped more than 30,000 years ago to build relationships between groups in Lesotho, southern Africa.

WORLD BRIEFS

Victims remembered as downing of MH-17 trial starts

THE names of 298 passengers killed when the MH-17 airliner was shot down were read out at the start of the murder trial of four fugitive defendants. Relatives listened to the tribute with bowed heads at the court in Amsterdam but none of the three accused Russians, Sergei Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin, or Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko, was present. All four, who are thought to be in Russia, face preliminary charges of the murder of 298 people and of causing the aircraft to crash. The Malaysian Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was hit by a surface-to-air missile in July, 2014 over Ukrainian territory held by pro-Russian rebels. Prosecutors say the suspects helped supply the Russian missile system, but Russia denies any involvement.

Just neck it!

A GIRAFFE almost does the splits as it stoops to drink from a watering hole. Photographer Steve Roos was able to lie on the ground feet away to capture the shot at Zimanga Nature Reserve in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.

Angry activists stage ‘Day Without Women’

THOUSANDS of women in Mexico stayed away from work and school in a strike protesting gender-based violence yesterday, as ten women per day are killed in the country. Protesters in Argentina and Chile also took part in the ‘Day Without Women’. Lawyer Viviana Mendez said: ‘What are they going to do without us if they are killing us?’

SpaceX’s sweet landing for space station crew

ELON MUSK’S SpaceX cargo ship has delivered treats out of this world on its 20th mission to the International Space Station. Astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan used a robot arm to capture the two-ton shipment, which included Skittles, Reese’s Pieces and Hot Tamales sweets. In future, the Dragon capsule will dock automatically at the space station.
