Liam Hemsworth and Gabriella Brooks started their day off right with a beach swim in Byron Bay (Picture: Splash News)

It seems like Liam Hemsworth and his girlfriend Gabriella Brooks are big fans of the mantra, ‘couples that beach together, stay together’.

While we may have just made that one up, there’s no denying that Liam, 30, and his gal are big beach-goers and they were recently seen starting their day off right with a morning swim.

Heading out in Byron Bay, the good-looking couple stripped down to their swimwear to take a dip together and the results were pretty much reminiscent of a scene from James Bond.

We’re talking Liam stepping out of the water all brooding and muscly, while his very own Bond girl, Gabriella, 21, is right beside him rocking her black bikini.

007 eat your heart out.

After their swim, the couple were seen wrapping up in their towels as they took a stroll along the beach.

The couple have been dating for a few months now, with Liam introducing Gabriella to his family in December (Picture: Splash News)

Liam and Gabriella have been dating for a few months now, with the Hunger Games actor reportedly introducing model Gabriella to his parents in December.

And it sounds like the Hemsworths are already championing Liam’s new romance, with a source telling Us Weekly: ‘Liam feels comfortable with Gabriella. His family approves of her and really likes her, which is very important to him.’

He was previously married to ex-wife Miley Cyrus, but the pair confirmed their split in August last year – eight months after they tied the knot in secret at their Nashville home at the end of 2018.

Miley and Liam had dated on and off for 10 years, but things are officially over for the former couple, as their divorce was finalised in January.

Following her split from Liam, Miley went on to date ex-girlfriend Kaitlynn Carter for a month, before finding love with boyfriend Cody Simpson.

Liam, meanwhile, was briefly linked to Dynasty star Maddison Brown, before sparking up a romance with girlfriend Gabriella.

Gabriella, who is Australian, like Liam, and is originally from Sydney, was previously linked to Matt Healy from British band The 1975.
