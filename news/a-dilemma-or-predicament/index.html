<p>Directed by Mansoor Ahmed, the film stars local actor Sangeeta Agrawal.</p>
<p>This week, till June 20th, a group of very talented local actors, writers, filmmakers and technicians will be showcasing their short film works online for your enjoyment. One of the films that made its premiere over this past week was Mansoor Ahmed’s The DIG, starring Sangeeta Agrawal, Rajiv Paul, Sri Mirajkar, Neeta Datt, Chetna Gola, Hema Ahmed, Stuti Bannerjee, Shubhankar Bannerjee, Saisha Vyas, Suresh Agrawala and Rajeev Agrawal.</p>
<p>Without ruining too many details, The DIG tells the tale of a woman, Aisha (Sangeeta Agrawal), going through a deep emotional trauma. Via her memories, we slowly learn the issues that have plagued her and which ultimately bring her to a shocking decision.</p>
<p>To the performances, this piece belongs completely to Sangeeta Agrawal she performs effortlessly and there was not a single false note in her expressions. It is extremely challenging to emote only facially and convey all emotions without a word, and she does so like a pro. All of the other actors have provided amazing expressions with their voices via Aisha’s memories as well, another challenge when just using your voice to convey emotion without being seen. It is always refreshing to see Rajiv Paul on screen with his amenable presence. While his part is brief, his moments also reveal the depth behind his character’s understanding of Aisha’s predicament.</p>
<p>The story by Mansoor Ahmed and script by Hema Ahmed must be applauded. It holds a great message about the human conscience. While Aisha harbors so much pain and takes an action in the heat of a moment to come out of a tough situation, her humanity also weighs strongly on her mind. She knows ultimately what the right thing to do is and she uses that to drive the conclusion of the film in a moment of courage.</p>
<p>The direction by Mansoor Ahmed is pitch perfect. Everything is conveyed through silences and facial expressions, which is an experiment that proves to be interesting because it showcases that in a film, dialogue is completely unnecessary if you have a strong script and great actors with great facial control of expressions. It must be commended that this risk was taken on this powerful film, which pays off.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I do not recognize the cinematography work. The hues of the film convey the melancholy of Aisha, and the chilling natural and isolated visuals further accentuate her dilemma and pain. A true masterstroke by the team!</p>
<p>I strongly recommend folks check out The DIG. It is a unique cinematic piece that film lovers should certainly experience!</p>

<h3 id="hsbcs-invidious-hong-kong-dilemma">&ldquo;HSBC&rsquo;s invidious Hong Kong dilemma&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2020/06/10/050620_HK-psd_4darker_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqslTXo4ubDZbY6K9f2lYKuPqBb2tzB0Kab0cq52sxghQ.jpg?impolicy=logo-overlay" alt="img">
HSBC was lauded as “brave” last year in London adland. In a branding campaign plastered across train stations nationwide the bank declared that Britain is “not an Island” but a “Colombian coffee-drinking, Swedish flat-pack assembling, Korean tablet-tapping, tikka masala-eating wonderful little lump of land”.</p>
<p>Viewed by some as a punchy anti-Brexit statement, the agency behind it insisted it was merely a reminder that we are all part of something bigger “whatever the political climate”. Whatever the truth, HSBC today finds itself drawn into a political row that poses much greater risks to its business after siding with Beijing over its “national security” crackdown on Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The proposed laws criminalise anti-government movements in the former British colony, and come as sources say HSBC is privately warning Downing Street it could face reprisals in China if Huawei is banned from the UK’s 5G network.</p>
<p>As its top bankers quietly try to steer Westminster while publicly backing Beijing plans that are opposed by Britain, pressure is rising on the board to decide if it is a Chinese bank or a British one. Its advertising slogan “together we thrive” has never looked more ironic.</p>
<p>“The risk is that as the bank pivots more towards Asia it will run into China more, so what’s the next thing that it’s going to compromise on?” says one of the bank’s major investors. “There’s nothing wrong with focusing on Asia, it’s a growth strategy, but it needs to stay independent otherwise it will become Bank of China part two.”</p>
<p>Many in the City sympathise with its predicament. The London-listed bank, full name the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, was founded in Hong Kong in 1865 and makes almost all of its money in Asia.

<h3 id="basler-dilemma--due-to-cabral-the-fcb-is-in-the-quandary">&ldquo;Basler Dilemma – Due to Cabral, the FCB is in the quandary&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.wirenewsfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Basler-Dilemma-Due-to-Cabral-the-FCB-is-in-the-quandary.jpg" alt="img">
Basler Dilemma – Due to Cabral, the FCB is in the predicament He is with the ball and in the Cup against Lausanne the match-winner. However, the Brazilian has the best cards for a new contract in Basel. Reason: massive pressure to make savings.Moritz Marthaler0 comment is Bernhard Burgeners heart bleed: Arthur Cabral, who was here with his overhead kick for 1:0 against Lausanne.Video: SRF</p>
<p>Swiss football clubs are in a date stress. The astonished to just anyone – with 13 rounds in six weeks. At least in the next few days, the pressure also applies to the transfer front: In two weeks, tens of contracts run out in the League. At FC Basel, it is mainly the players out on loan. Your Situation is unsatisfactory. The two Brazilians, Ramires and Arthur Cabral about are just somewhere between the place of departure in the home, and an intense summer in Switzerland.</p>
<p>In the case of the 22-year-old Cabral everything you need for a whereabouts speaks purely athletic: In the Cup quarter-final against Lausanne, he scored the first goal on Swiss football places since Guillaume Hoaraus Penalty to make it 3:3 in the spectacle at the end of February between St. Gallen and YB. The case back out to see he leaves later the 2:0 consequences. Young, vigorous, accurate – the claim to a Transfer of Cabral met in any case.</p>
<p>“In his heart”</p>
<p>But with the claims and the reality it is currently a thing in the FCB. After the miserable fiscal year 2019, with almost 20 million franc loss the question of whether a Takeover of Cabrals club Palmeiras is a topic of rather. “In the case of Cabral, the heart bleeds for me,” says Burgener prior to its strong performance in Lausanne, the “Sonntagsblick”. And: “we Would make the two Transfers with Zhegrova and Cabral, we could pay in August for the last Time the wages.”</p>
<p>The people who take care of me, forward a little more to me. Basel match-winner Cabral</p>
<p>the 21-year-old winger Edon Zhegrova is borrowed from the Belgian Club Genk. At his state-of-the FCB in front of the same Dilemma: From the sporty qualities, one is absolutely convinced, for a Transfer but one can hardly afford. The contract built-in option to purchase has drawn in his case, ever, further negotiations are underway.</p>
<p>For the amazement of the match made the winner, and returned with statements after the game. The question of whether the club responsible had already talked to him, he denied it. “The people who take care of me, guide very little to me.”</p>
<p>Cabral would be the cost of the FCB in accordance with the contract in the case of an Acquisition of 4.5 million Swiss francs, with compatriot Ramires due to injury so far with 27 minutes for the first team – should it be 6 million Swiss francs. Both too much for the FCB. In the case of Zhegrova and Cabral, President of Burgener has not given up hope. “Our desire would be to oblige both of them. I hope we can find a solution with the owners of clubs.”</p>
<p>The clock is ticking, as of today, there are still 14 days until the date. All the same, he Should not be still sure of it, can Burgener in two weeks, Cabral in four games. It appointment stress finally in the Super League.</p>

<h3 id="predicted-predicaments-o-cowind-if-lockdown-comes-can-key-questions-be-far-behind">&ldquo;Predicted predicaments: O Cowind! If lockdown comes, can key questions be far behind&rdquo;</h3>

If there’d been a pandemic in Shelley’s time, would he have written an Ode to the Wild Wuhan Wind? No. But even if yes, there’d be little optimism in its concluding line, ‘If Corona comes, can Covid be far behind?’ The virus came in winter, spring has come and gone, but the mighty mite hasn’t. The hope that summer would make it dry up and die out is diminishing faster than available beds. Just as WWII came not long after the ‘War To End All Wars’, Lockdown 1.0, far from sending it into retreat, has spawned Ld 2, 3 and now 4.0, like it’s competing with TV serials. Naturally, dilemmas have risen along with cases. A sampler:</p>
<p>Even Our Leader of Supreme Confidence must find ways to reconcile his rah-rah over successive lockdowns with the growing evidence of unlocked misery; create the illusion that Magician Modi will make the mounting problems disappear with his sleight of speech; and decide which community to stroke with his choice of gamchha in his next address.</p>
<p>Our More Harried Finance Minister has to figure out how to pacify everyone from farmers to fatcats; which set of initials, DBT, MSME, TDS etc to pull out next; and ensure that the twists and turns of her serial appearances don’t reveal that she’s lost the plot.</p>
<p>State leaders don’t know whether to stop migrant workers from departing or prevent them from arriving; whether to see Covid as a medical challenge or a political opportunity. No less than national netas, they have to find ways to pretend they’re in control while the virus goes laughing all the way to the blood bank.</p>
<p>Municipal commissioners waver between increasing testing or treatment, oxygen-equipped beds or ventilators, containing virulent Covid or viral Covideos. And which stadium, club or public park to commandeer with the least political – and personal – fallout.</p>
<p>We less lofty beings too have questions. In zones, is Green the new Black? How soon will new normal lapse into old normal? And how will Dr Modi’s latest prescription of Atmanirbhar manage our endemic addiction to all things foreign; will even eaters of the exotic, from avocado to zuccotto, be lynched as ‘anti-nationals’?</p>

<h3 id="europes-covid-predicament--how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-the-anti-vaxxers">&ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s Covid predicament – how do you solve a problem like the anti-vaxxers?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/037f4a3ef432c8c05058618417447940553c9ddc/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=55f016ecb4c5ec7a579c6430480fa1ce" alt="img">
In front of Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate a politically incongruous crowd of protesters gathered on Saturday. They wore flowers in their hair, hazmat suits emblazoned with the letter Q, badges displaying the old German imperial flag or T-shirts reading “Gates, My Ass” – a reference to the US software billionaire Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Around the globe, millions are counting the days until a Covid-19 vaccine is discovered. These people, however, were protesting for the right not to be inoculated – and they weren’t the only ones.</p>
<p>For the ninth week running, thousands gathered in European cities to vent their anger at social distancing restrictions they believe to be a draconian ploy to suspend basic civil rights and pave the way for “enforced vaccinations” that will do more harm than the Covid-19 virus itself.</p>
<p>Walking towards the focal point of the protests down the Straße des 17. Juni boulevard, one woman said she believed the Covid-19 pandemic to be a hoax thought up by the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>“I’d never let myself be vaccinated,” said the woman, who would give her name only as Riot Granny. “I didn’t get a jab for the flu either, and I am still alive.”</p>
<p>The alliance of anti-vaxxers, neo-Nazi rabble-rousers and esoteric hippies, which has in recent weeks been filling town squares in cities such as Berlin, Vienna and Zurich is starting to trouble governments as they map out scenarios for re-booting their economies and tackling the coronavirus long term.</p>
<p>Even before an effective vaccine against Covid-19 has been developed, national leaders face a dilemma: should they aim to immunise as large a part of the population as possible as quickly as possible, or does compulsory vaccination risk boosting a street movement already prone to conspiracy theories about “big pharma” and its government’s authoritarian tendencies?</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Deputy leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party Beatrix von Storch holds up a placard reading: ‘Freedom of Speech’ during an anti-lockdown protest in Berlin. Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty Images</p>
<p>Preliminary results of a survey by the Vaccine Confidence Project and ORB International, carried out when infections in Europe were still rising rapidly in early April, show resistance to a vaccine to be especially high in countries that have managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, where immunologists have proposed that mass vaccinations could take place as early as October, 20% of people questioned said they would not be willing to be vaccinated. In Austria, vaccine scepticism was similarly rife, with 18% of those questioned saying they would reject vaccination.</p>
<p>In Germany, where 9% opposed vaccination in April, the figure may have since increased as the virus has claimed fewer victims relative to other countries. A parallel survey by the university of Erfurt found the number of Germans asked whether they would take a Covid-19 vaccine when it became available had dropped from 79% in mid-April to 63% last week.</p>
<p>In the UK, where ORB International surveyed opinions from 6 to 7 May, 10% of respondents said they were unwilling to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>While scientists predict that immunising about 70% of the population could be sufficient for the virus to vanish, there are concerns that a noisy minority could seize the narrative around vaccination.</p>
<p>There’s a real fear of an unholy alliance between esoteric leftwingers, the far right and the Reichsbürger movement Natalie Grams, doctor</p>
<p>Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas has jokingly advised the public to “keep a lot more than just a 1.5-metre distance” from those spreading conspiracy theories, but fears of the movement growing into a force equivalent to the Pegida protests against Angela Merkel’s asylum policy seem to be shaping the thinking in Berlin’s seats of power.</p>
<p>In spite of some scientists calling for mandatory vaccination against Covid-19, health minister Jens Spahn has said he would favour a voluntary programme, while the mooted introduction of “immunity passports” for those who have been vaccinated or developed antibodies was withdrawn from a new “pandemic law” that passed through the Bundestag this month.</p>
<p>“There’s a real fear of an unholy alliance between esoteric leftwingers, the far right and the Reichsbürger movement,” said Natalie Grams, a doctor and author who specialises in debunking claims about the effectiveness of alternative medicine.</p>
<p>“When it comes to people strongly opposed to vaccinations, you are usually looking at 2-4% of the population in Germany. But with this alliance you are looking at broader resistance among the population.</p>
<p>“While there isn’t a vaccine but everyone is talking about one, the anti-vaccination movement has found a perfect environment to flourish”, said Grams, who used to practise homeopathy herself. “Virologists are weighing up evidence and come up with slightly conflicting advice, while the big health bodies take weeks to formulate their messages. Anti-vaxxers are exploiting this uncertainty.”</p>
<p>In France, anti-vaccination sentiments are seen as a phenomenon of the current millennium, fed by a wider distrust of central government. In German-speaking countries, by contrast, wariness of vaccination programmes dates back to the 19th century.</p>
<p>In the first half of the 20th century, anti-vaxxer views converged with anti-semitism: the Third Reich was rife with conspiracy theories presenting vaccination programmes as a Jewish plot to either poison the German nation or “submit humanity to Jewish mammonism”.</p>
<p>Some historians believe that voluntary vaccination programmes against Covid-19 would not only be less politically risky but also more effective at protecting the population from coronavirus.</p>
<p>“When it comes to vaccination programmes, the debate is rarely about the disease itself but about the relationship between the individual and the state”, said historian Malte Thiessen, who runs the Institute for Westphalian History in Münster. “In Germany this is a question that goes back to the 19th century: can the government force people to be healthy?”

<h3 id="diego-garcia-indias-conundrum">&ldquo;Diego Garcia: India’s conundrum&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/8636887637_4911a54294_o.jpg" alt="img">
The tug-of-war between the United Kingdom and Mauritius over Chagos archipelago – and the US military base on Diego Garcia – is hotting up. In 2019, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution which endorsed a non binding decision from the International Court of Justice that supported Mauritius’s claim to the Chagos. London has so far stoutly resisted calls to hand over the islands.</p>
<p>Given its regional proximity, what role should India play in resolving the dispute consistent with its own interests?</p>
<p>Both Britain and the United States expect help from India on Chagos. At the UN General Assembly in May 2019, Washington and London had hoped New Delhi would modify and even dilute the provisions of the draft resolution. Instead India voted in favour of Mauritius, with the Indian representation stating unequivocal support for “all peoples striving for decolonisation”. But Indian officials have since refrained from commenting on the issue.</p>
<p>Some British commentators have explained India’s move as an attempt to position itself as a leader among post-colonial states. New Delhi, they contend, remains enamored of South-South cooperation, prioritising partnerships with Southern states over cooperation with Euro-Atlantic partners. They argue that supporting Mauritius was a “symbolic” rather than substantive win, with New Delhi overlooking its long-term interests in countering China’s growing presence in the Indian Ocean. With its own ambitions to develop a base in the Mauritian island of Agalega stalled, New Delhi’s move at the UN backfired.</p>
<p>Indian observers have been more understanding of their country’s imperatives. As they see it, Diego Garcia presents New Delhi with a predicament with no easy answers. On one hand, Indian policymakers must demonstrate solidarity with Mauritius, a close Indian Ocean partner. On the other, they must consider their country’s burgeoning ties with the United States and Britain. If New Delhi now seems reticent on the matter, it is because it finds itself in a debilitating dilemma.</p>
<p>But India’s conundrum may seem more severe than it really is. For all the talk about India not wanting China to fill an Indian Ocean strategic vacuum created by any departure of US forces, supporting Mauritius has always been a fairly straightforward choice for New Delhi. Diego Garcia’s controversial history has meant that room for manoeuvre on the issue has been limited. As much as they value political ties with London and Washington, Indian policymakers cannot be seen to favour a US military presence over indigenous people’s rights.</p>
<p>A second reason that New Delhi has not supported the US over Diego Garcia is the constrained nature of India-US military cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, a space where Indian and US strategic objectives do not properly align. In particular, New Delhi does not support US naval operations in the Persian Gulf intended at coercing Iran. With growing maritime interests in the Middle East, India is keen to improve naval ties with all regional capitals, including Tehran. New Delhi can’t get itself to deploy naval assets to a US facility used to facilitate anti-Iran naval operations.</p>
<p>Lastly, Indian realists are concerned about strategic reciprocity. If Indian warships and surveillance aircraft publicly use Diego Garcia, Washington would expect access to India’s bases in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. New Delhi has a mutual logistics agreement with the United States but has been slow to operationalise the pact for fear of opening up its island bases to the US navy. While maritime “access” in South and Southeast Asia has never really been an issue for Washington, the regular presence of US warships in the Andaman Sea, Indian analysts reckon, could more credibly threaten China’s use of the regional sea lines of communication, potentially creating discord in the region.</p>
<p>Some say that China’s well-known salami slicing strategy is increasingly at play in South Asia.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding closing bilateral military relations between India and the US – including a tri-services exercise and joint anti-submarine patrols – a strategic quid pro quo involving Diego Garcia could also force the Indian navy into a framework of closer strategic engagement with the US navy in South Asia. This could impinge on New Delhi’s strategic autonomy, rendering India a de facto alliance partner of the United States – a proposition wholly unacceptable to Indian policymakers.</p>
<p>Further, many in India’s strategic establishment are convinced that Beijing’s expanding maritime footprint in the Indian Ocean isn’t merely the result of greater PLAN deployments. Belt and Road infrastructure projects have played an equally significant part, enmeshing regional states in a Chinese-led initiative. This isn’t the type of presence that India-US joint naval operations seem capable of effectively pushing back.</p>
<p>And yet events are moving fast, and in ways unanticipated by India. Since the beginning of this year, there have been reports of an expansion of the PLA base in Djibouti, greater Chinese naval operations in the Western Indian Ocean, growing Chinese intelligence and survey ships in the Andaman Seas and, perhaps, the beginnings of a Chinese military presence in the Pakistani port of Gwadar. Some say that China’s well-known salami slicing strategy is increasingly at play in South Asia.</p>
<p>India’s Ladakh standoff with China confirms that belief. So far New Delhi has treated its land skirmishes with the PLA as a localised matter. Yet the need for a maritime hedge and greater strategic alignment with the US in the Indian Ocean is clearer than ever.</p>
<p>Indian officials know that brokering a settlement on Diego Garcia could form part of the expected give-and-take. New Delhi could, for example, facilitate an agreement giving Port Louis sovereignty, whilst tempering Mauritian expectations that it could impose restrictions on the positioning of US nuclear assets.</p>
<p>India might realise that a failure to make common cause with Washington in the Western Indian Ocean, including Diego Garcia, might adversely implicate New Delhi’s attempts to dominate littoral-South Asia.</p>
<p>This piece is part of a two-year project being undertaken by the National Security College on the Indian Ocean, with the support of the Department of Defence.

<h3 id="toss-a-pc-copy-of-witcher-3-to-your-friend-if-you-own-it-on-another-platform">&ldquo;Toss a PC copy of Witcher 3 to your friend if you own it on another platform&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://destructoid.com/ul/594493-Witcher-3-free.jpg" alt="img">
Or, keep it for yourself</p>
<p>date: 2020-06-18T11:50:46+08:00</p>
<p>Remember Ice Breakers mints, with their two-lidded packaging reading &ldquo;To Share&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not to Share?&rdquo; The sharing side is small as if to ask &ldquo;Why would you ever be dumb enough to share these delicious mints?&rdquo; The not-sharing side is huge &ndash; half the case if memory serves &ndash; as if you&rsquo;ve going to shovel them all in your mouth at once.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red presents Witcher 3 owners with a similar predicament of greed, just without the refreshing aftertaste. Anyone who owns a copy of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt elsewhere can claim another free copy of it on GOG (which is CD Projekt&rsquo;s PC games marketplace and launcher). Steam, Epic, Origin PS4, Xbox One &ndash; owning Witcher 3 any of those places will net you the DRM-free GOG version at no extra cost. Switch is the only platform that&rsquo;s not eligible.</p>
<p>Additionally, there&rsquo;s parity across different editions of the game. If your copy of Witcher 3 is the Game of the Year edition with all the expansions, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll get on GOG. If it&rsquo;s just the base game, your GOG version will be just the base game. Also, it applies to retail boxed copies. If you&rsquo;ve played The Witcher 3 on your console &ndash; even if you&rsquo;ve already sold the disc or never even owned it &ndash; GOG will detect it has been played on your account and gift the free game.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the minty dilemma: That free copy is acquired by linking other platforms&rsquo; accounts with GOG (verifying you own it elsewhere), which gifts the game. However, an under-reported step of the process is that it comes in the form of a redeemable code. On Twitter, a user lamented that they own Witcher 3 on all platforms already, prompting the GOG account to reply &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t participate in this offer, though! You can still get a giftable code to share with someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To share or not to share? To bestow the incredible experience of The Witcher 3 on a person you care deeply for? Or to hoard it for yourself like a dragon atop his pile of gold? Figure it out before June 23 when this promotion ends. Choose wisely.</p>
