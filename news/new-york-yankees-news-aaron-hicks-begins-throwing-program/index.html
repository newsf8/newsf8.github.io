After having Tommy John surgery last fall, New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Hicks is taking the next step in his recovery process.</p>
<p>Heading into this season, fans expected the New York Yankees to be without Aaron Hicks for the majority of the campaign. He was slated to return to the majors sometime this summer after having Tommy John surgery in October.</p>
<p>But in spite of MLB’s hiatus, the Yankees have announced some positive news involving their veteran outfielder.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, manager Aaron Boone confirmed to members of the media that Hicks has begun a throwing program at his home in Arizona.</p>
<p>Aaron Hicks has started a throwing program. He is in Arizona with a physical therapist. James Paxton is continuing his throwing program at home in Wisconsin. — Bryan Hoch (@BryanHoch) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>For the Yanks, this means that there’s still a chance for Hicks to have a significant impact in 2020. The 30-year-old would’ve previously missed around the first 60 games of the regular season, at least.</p>
<p>But with Opening Day pushed back, Hicks could potentially be ready to play whenever it’s safe for baseball to return. Currently, most league executives are preparing for the season to start sometime in June or July.</p>
<p>If that occurs, then the Yankees could play the 6-foot-2 outfielder in center field to begin the year. Furthermore, he could also start showing that he deserves the seven-year, $70 million extension he signed prior to last season.</p>
<p>Since the Yanks awarded Hicks that long-term deal, he’s spent more time on the injured list than the actual field. In 2019, the switch-hitter played in just 59 games and hit 12 home runs with 36 RBI’s, a .208 ISO, .286 BABIP, 102 wRC+, and 1.1 fWAR rating. He additionally put up a slashing line of .235/.325/.443/.769 over his 255 plate appearances.</p>
<p>In addition, Hicks only played 499.1 innings in center field. He produced a -1 DRS, -2 OAA, 0.6 UZR, and 0.8 UZR/150 last season.</p>
<p>Once the 2020 campaign resumes, the Yankees could possess a crowded outfield. If Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, and Hicks are all healthy, then it may become difficult to find playing time for Brett Gardner and Clint Frazier.</p>
<p>As a result, New York may have to utilize Frazier’s final minor-league option this season. There’s still a slight chance that the young outfielder could break camp with the major league squad though.</p>
<p>Unless the Commissioner’s Office cancels the 2020 campaign, Hicks will likely either miss a handful of regular-season games or be ready for Opening Day. In the meantime, he’ll look to continue his rehab as we wait for this crisis to pass.

<h3 id="new-york-yankees-four-players-they-should-consider-trading-for-during-the-season">New York Yankees: Four players they should consider trading for during the season</h3>
<p><img src="https://yanksgoyard.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2016/04/1173913473.jpeg" alt="img">
Even though there will be no baseball until mid-May at the earliest, the Yankees may still decide to acquire some help before the trade deadline to help bolster the team heading into the playoffs.</p>
<p>Every team’s goal is to strive for as much success as possible, but the only way the Yankees achieve success is by winning a World Series title. That is exactly what they will be pushing for this year, and have put together a team that will give them a great chance to win #28.</p>
<p>The biggest indicator was the record-breaking signing of Gerrit Cole, who inked a 9-year, $324 million contract with the Yankees. Cole, who is fresh off a fantastic 2019 season, the Yankees’ biggest competitors in the American League in order to sign with his childhood team.</p>
<p>Cole will be a huge help for the Yankees, but he is not the sole reason that they will be able to compete for a World Series. They may look for help in other areas not relating to pitching to better improve their overall roster.</p>
<p>Although there is no definite timetable for a return to baseball, these are four candidates the Yankees may want to consider trading for during the season if baseball does return at some point.

<h3 id="yankees-opening-day-an-easy-coronavirus-sacrifice-for-john-sterling-this-kills-people">Yankees Opening Day an easy coronavirus sacrifice for John Sterling: ‘This kills people’</h3>
<p><img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/john-sterling-yankees.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
The radio voice of the Yankees, John Sterling, 81, will not be broadcasting on what was supposed to be Opening Day on Thursday.</p>
<p>“This is the most unusual thing that has occurred in all of our lives,” Sterling told The Post. “There have been other scares before, but they weren’t worldwide. This is so important, so vital to us as human beings because, if we don’t stop it, we will all die.”</p>
<p>Sterling, in only his way, had a little chuckle in his voice, as he made his bold declaration. His voice sounded strong and ready to go. While he wishes there was baseball sooner than later, he remains in good spirits.</p>
<p>Sterling lives his life with an Opening Day feel, as he is filled with hope and optimism, no matter the circumstance.</p>
<p>“I entertain myself very well,” Sterling said.</p>
<p>He wakes up in his Jersey condo late, around 10:30 or 11 a.m., and quickly goes to a nearby store to pick up fruit, coffee and the newspapers. He then has brunch, before cleaning up to “look presentable for myself.” He spends his afternoons speaking with friends from around the country and reading.</p>
<p>He just finished autobiographies by Elton John, Carrie Fisher and Elaine Stritch. He also is engrossed in Ken Follett’s “A Place Called Freedom.”</p>
<p>He usually has some sort of game playing on one of his TVs. At night, he watches one of the cable news channels and old movies.</p>
<p>“I’m very good at DVR,” Sterling said. “That is the only mechanical thing I can do. I must have 50 terrific movies on one of my screens in the bedroom. Would I like to be doing games? Of course. Would I like to see people? Of course. Would I like to go to a restaurant? That’s the oddest thing, you literally can’t call up friends and say let’s meet at such and such restaurant.”</p>
<p>Sterling is hopeful baseball will return, but the man known for saying, “Thuuuuuuuuugh Yankees win,” has a message for everyone on how to beat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“It is just a very odd time, but we are all doing the right thing,” Sterling said. “This is a world problem. This is really serious. This kills people, so we have to do what they suggest, be under quote-unquote house arrest and hope they find a vaccine for this or find a way to arrest it. In the meantime, I’ll keep doing it.”</p>
<p>Quick Clicks: Peyton Manning said no again to going in the broadcast booth with ESPN’s “Monday Night Football.” There had been some feeling that he didn’t want to be a broadcaster with his brother Eli Manning in the league. With Eli retired, Peyton still said no, even with ESPN willing to pay him $10 million-plus. He maybe would’ve gotten around Romo money at $18 million per. But it seems pretty simple: Peyton does not have a passion to be in the booth. If ESPN had acquired Al Michaels from NBC, it may have had a chance. It is clear that if Peyton is ever going to go into the booth, it is going to need to be a perfect situation — and even then, he may still decline. … As part of MLB’s celebration of Opening Day without Opening Day, it will show the 2003 ALCS Aaron Boone Game 7 on Facebook at 2:50 p.m. Meanwhile, on Twitter at 6 p.m., the Mets’ 2015 NLDS Game 5 win. Besides social media, FS1 and MLBN will have games. … Ex-ESPNer Gerry Matalon has a business in which he coaches individuals to work on all media platforms, including TV. He has many big-name clients, including Von Miller. His 90-year-old dad, Izzy, an avid reader of The Post and this column, recently fell and broke his hip.</p>
<p>With the coronavirus restrictions, Gerry can’t visit his father at the Queens rehab facility. Our best wishes to Izzy, a man of fine taste.</p>
<p>Clicker Books: For baseball fans, Papa Clicker has read Jared Diamond’s “Swing Kings,” which goes deep into the finer details of hitting, looking at players such as Aaron Judge, J.D. Martinez and Justin Turner. It receives a 4.15 out of 5, as, like the intricacies of the swings, it is custom-made for a certain type of baseball reader.
