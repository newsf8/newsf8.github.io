<p>The UNSC is composed of 15 members: five permanent members — China, France, Russian Federation, the United States, and the United Kingdom — and 10 non-permanent members who are elected by the General Assembly. The UNSC is composed of 15 members: five permanent members — China, France, Russian Federation, the United States, and the United Kingdom — and 10 non-permanent members who are elected by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Early on Thursday (June 18), the official handle of the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations in New York tweeted: “Member States elect India to the non-permanent seat of the Security Council for the term 2021-22 with overwhelming support. India gets 184 out of the 192 valid votes polled.”</p>
<p>In a video message, T S Tirumurti, Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations, said he was “deeply humbled by the tremendous confidence which the member states of the United Nations have reposed in India”.</p>
<p>What are ‘non-permanent seats’ at the UNSC?</p>
<p>The UNSC is composed of 15 members: five permanent members — China, France, Russian Federation, the United States, and the United Kingdom — and 10 non-permanent members who are elected by the General Assembly. The non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms — so every year, the General Assembly elects five non-permanent members out of the total 10.</p>
<p>These 10 seats are distributed among the regions of the world: five seats for African and Asian countries; one for Eastern European countries; two for Latin American and Caribbean countries; and two for Western European and Other Countries.</p>
<p>Of the five seats for Africa and Asia, three are for Africa and two for Asia. Also, there is an informal understanding between the two groups to reserve one seat for an Arab country. The Africa and Asia Pacific group takes turns every two years to put up an Arab candidate.</p>
<p>Elections for terms beginning in even-numbered years select two African members, and one each within Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Terms beginning in odd-numbered years consist of two Western European and Other members, and one each from Asia Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The current non-permanent members of the Security Council are Belgium, Dominican Republic, Germany, Indonesia, and South Africa, all of whose terms end this year; and Estonia, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia, and Vietnam, whose terms end in 2021.</p>
<p>India begins its term in the beginning of 2021, and will hold the position until the end of 2022.</p>
<p>What happened at the election that India won?</p>
<p>India was the only candidate for the vacancy from the Asia Pacific. Its candidature for the seat was endorsed unanimously by the Asia Pacific group, which comprises 55 countries, including Pakistan and China, last year.</p>
<p>“A unanimous step. Asia-Pacific Group @UN unanimously endorses India’s candidature for a non-permanent seat of the Security Council for a 2-year term in 2021/22. Thanks to all 55 members for their support,” Syed Akbaruddin, Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations at the time, had tweeted on June 26, 2019.</p>
<p>That endorsement meant that India would be a “clean slate” candidate for the elections, with an assured victory.</p>
<p>Besides India, China, and Pakistan the 55-country Asia Pacific group includes Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Cyprus, North Korea, South Korea, Fiji, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kiribati, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Qatar, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, UAE, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam, and Yemen.</p>
<p>Has India been in the UNSC earlier?</p>
<p>India has earlier been a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 1950-51, 1967-68, 1972-73, 1977-78, 1984-85, 1991-92 and 2011-12. For the 2011-12 term, India won 187 of 190 votes after Kazakhstan stood down from its candidacy.</p>
<p>Unlike Africa, which has formalised a system of rotation of its three seats, the Asia Pacific grouping has often seen contests for seats. In 2018, there was a contest between the Maldives and Indonesia. On the occasions when there is a contest, the elections for non-permanent seats can go on for several rounds. Back in 1975, there was a contest between India and Pakistan, which went into eight rounds, with Pakistan finally winning the seat. And in 1996, India lost a contest to Japan.</p>
<p>Even if a country is a “clean slate” candidate and has been endorsed by its group, it still needs to secure the votes of two-thirds of the members present and voting at the General Assembly session — which is a minimum of 129 votes, if all 193 member states participate.</p>
<p>After India won 184 of the 192 votes cast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked the nations of the world. “Deeply grateful for the overwhelming support shown by the global community for India’s membership of the @UN Security Council. India will work with all member countries to promote global peace, security, resilience and equity,” the Prime Minister said on Twitter.</p>

<p>NAIROBI, Kenya June 18 – Kenya has won the United Nations Security Council seat as a non-permanent member for 2021-22.</p>
<p>Kenya was declared winner on Thursday night, after beating Djibouti with 129 votes against 62 in the second round of voting at the UNSC headquarters in New York city.</p>
<p>Kenya enjoyed support of the African Union, even as Djibouti pushed to have the seat due to Nairobi’s past participation on the Security Council and the principle of rotation.</p>
<p>French-speaking Djibouti and English-speaking Kenya both highlighted their roles in seeking peace on the Horn of Africa, as well as their contributions to UN peacekeeping options.</p>
<p>Kenya won largely due to its support for refugees from Somalia and South Sudan, as well as to its support to the two countries’ fragile governments.</p>
<p>During an initial vote Wednesday, Kenya was unable to secure the required two-thirds majority after garnering 113 votes against Djibouti’s 78, prompting a repeat poll Thursday.</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly elected on Wednesday four new members of the Security Council for 2021 and 2022, with Canada losing out again and the battle for the African seat going to a second round.</p>
<p>India, Mexico, Norway and Ireland were chosen as non-permanent members, while Djibouti and Kenya — both of which failed to receive the two-thirds vote majority required to win — will go to a second round of voting on Thursday.</p>

<p>Canada was beaten once again for one of the Western seats, by Ireland and Norway, despite a long and star-studded campaign, a result likely to be a blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>In the Asia-Pacific region, India — which has been trying unsuccessfully to win a permanent seat in an expanded Security Council — ran unopposed to win 184 votes out of the 192 countries that participated in the election.</p>
<p>The result means that India will now have a seat at the same table as China, just days after the two nations disputed their Himalayan border, trading blame for a brawl that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.</p>
<p>Mexico, which also ran unopposed, earned 187 votes.</p>
<p>For Europe and the Western seats, the competition was more customary.</p>
<p>Canada — already stung by a defeat in 2010 during its last bid for the Security Council, when the General Assembly chose Portugal instead — was dominated by Norway, with 130 votes, and Ireland, which had 128, the minimum number required to win.</p>
<p>Trudeau had invested heavily in the latest Security Council effort, with the defeat potentially causing him political embarrassment at home.</p>
<p>“As we move forward, we remain committed to the goals and principles that we laid out during this campaign,” Trudeau said in a statement, adding that Canada would “continue to play a vital role in advancing global cooperation and building a more peaceful, inclusive and sustainable world.”</p>
<p>– Celine Dion vs Bono –</p>
<p>Hoping to woo delegates, both Canada and Ireland had wielded star power: Celine Dion sang in New York City to promote Canada at the UN, while U2 performed a concert in the Big Apple for Ireland.</p>
<p>Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.</p>
<p>“Campaigning for a UNSC seat involves endless lobbying, entertaining and worrying that the ambassador who just promised you a vote is a liar,” tweeted Richard Gowan, an expert on the world body at the International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>Fearing fraud or manipulation, the General Assembly did not vote electronically, even though the United Nations is mostly operating virtually until the end of July due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Instead, each of the 193 delegations had a chance to cast a secret ballot at a designated time scattered throughout the day in the famous Assembly Hall. Each new Security Council member needed to win two-thirds of the votes cast.</p>
<p>The Security Council has 10 non-permanent members in addition to the veto-wielding Big Five — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>The General Assembly also elected Turkish diplomat Volkan Bozkir as its president for the 2020-21 session on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bozkir was the only candidate running, but Armenia, Cyprus and Greece — all of which have historically tense relations with Turkey — opposed him, meaning he could not be elected by consensus and nations had to cast votes.

<h3 id="4-countries-win-seats-on-un-security-council-5th-goes-to-runoff">&ldquo;4 Countries Win Seats on UN Security Council; 5th Goes to Runoff&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/reuters-images/2020/06/reuters_com_2020_newsml_RC2OAH91WC30.jpg" alt="img">
NEW YORK - Four countries were elected to two-year terms on the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday in the first major vote held at the world body amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>India, Ireland, Mexico and Norway will join the council on January 1 for the rotating term. But a decision on who will occupy a seat representing Africa will go to a second round of voting Thursday, as neither of the contenders, Kenya and Djibouti, captured the necessary two-thirds majority.</p>
<p>The vote was held in a sparsely populated General Assembly Hall. In mid-March, the United Nations essentially shut down its New York headquarters as the coronavirus spread across the metropolis. The city began its very limited first phase of reopening June 8, but that does not include large gatherings like the hundreds of diplomats who would normally flock to the building to cast their votes.</p>
<p>At the assembly hall on Wednesday, life in a COVID-19 world was on full display. Diplomats wearing face masks came one by one to fill in their secret ballots, deposit them and leave. Instead of everyone gathering and casting votes simultaneously, the process took much of the day. There were no people socializing, no goodie bags from candidate countries and definitely no kisses on the cheek.</p>
<p>In the final months and weeks leading up to the vote, there were none of the parties and special events that candidate countries love to put on to raise their profiles and garner votes.</p>
<p>Council seats are allocated according to regional blocs. In the group known as “Western Europe and Others,” Canada, Ireland and Norway were contesting two available seats.</p>
<p>With a two-thirds majority of 128 votes needed, Ireland and Norway both squeaked by with 128 and 130 votes respectively. For a second consecutive time, Canada lost its bid for a seat. But it garnered 108 votes, putting it within respectable reach of that needed majority.</p>
<p>Ireland’s win means the European Union will hold three seats on the 15-nation council.</p>
<p>“The race between Canada, Ireland and Norway has felt a little surreal for all involved,” said Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group. “All three are well-established friends of the United Nations, and they have sometimes struggled to distinguish themselves from one another. The irony is that all three states would happily vote for each other under any other circumstances.”</p>
<p>Mexico was the candidate from the Latin America and the Caribbean bloc, and India for Asia-Pacific. Both ran uncontested and won overwhelming majorities.</p>
<p>Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, welcomed his country’s 187 votes on Twitter, saying, “Great recognition to our country around the world. Congratulations!!!!”</p>
<p>Tengo el honor de informar que México ha sido electo por 187 votos miembro del Consejo de Seguridad de la Organizacion de las Naciones Unidas. Gran reconocimiento a nuestro país en todo el mundo. Enhorabuena!!!! — Marcelo Ebrard C. (@m_ebrard) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>Just a day before the vote, a clash between Indian and Chinese troops along a remote Himalayan border in Eastern Ladakh left 20 Indian soldiers dead.</p>
<p>“India may see its term in the council as an opportunity to push back against China, which has been insisting on council debates over New Delhi&rsquo;s behavior in Kashmir,” Gowan said. “After the tensions in Ladakh, Indian-Chinese relations in the council could be sparky.”</p>

<p>It was the race between East African nations Djibouti and Kenya that gave the day some unexpected drama. Kenya received 113 votes, Djibouti 78 – neither sufficient to achieve the two-thirds majority of 128. A second round of voting will take place Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The newly elected countries will replace exiting council members Belgium, Dominican Republic, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa. They will join current nonpermanent members Estonia, Niger, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam, and permanent members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.

<h3 id="india-expects-to-sail-through-unsc-vote">&ldquo;India expects to sail through UNSC vote&rdquo;</h3>

India expects to sail through as the 193-member United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) votes on Wednesday for contenders to five non-permanent seats at the UN Security Council for 2021-22. India is standing unopposed as the nominee for the Asia-Pacific seat, and needs two-thirds of UNGA members, or 129 votes, to be confirmed. Mexico is also unopposed in its bid for the Latin American and Caribbean seat, while there is a straight contest between Kenya and late entrant Djibouti for the African seat.</p>
<p>Also read: UNSC reform process, negotiations postponed ‘until further notice’ due to COVID-19</p>
<p>All eyes are, however on the contest between Canada, Ireland and Norway, who are vying for the two seats allotted to the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), with each making a pitch for India’s vote, including a late evening call on Tuesday from Canadian PM Trudeau to PM Modi. The two leaders had spoken last as recently as on April 29.</p>
<p>‘Not complacent’</p>
<p>On Friday, Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide held a videoconference with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Eliciting votes for the UNSC was “one of the topics discussed” said Norwegian Ambassador Hans Jacob Frydenlund. “We count on support from a number of friendly countries. We are confident, but not complacent of securing the seat at the UNSC,” he told The Hindu when asked if India had assured Norway its support.</p>
<p>Irish Ambassador to India Brendan Ward would not comment on whether India had specifically offered support. PM Modi spoke to Irish PM Leo Varadkar on April 22, and had also met him on the sideline of the UNGA in New York last September.</p>

<p>“Both Ireland and India have the advantage that neither is a member of a military alliance,” Mr. Ward told The Hindu. “India has led the Non Aligned Movement (NAM), while Ireland has a unique position as a member of the European Union that is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) alliance,” he added, also alluding to the other “common bond”, that PM Varadkar is of Indian origin.</p>
<p>Canada in fray</p>
<p>While Ireland announced its candidature in 2005, and Norway in 2007, Canada has been a relatively new entrant in the fray; with PM Justin Trudeau announcing its bid for the UNSC in 2016, shortly after being elected to power.</p>
<p>Mr. Trudeau has pitched Canada’s campaign as a push for multilateralism in the post COVID-19 global recovery, and has reached out personally to many countries.</p>
<p>In its own campaign brochure, India had highlighted its commitment to multilateralism; demand for transparency in mandates for UN peacekeeping missions; push for the Indian-led Comprehensive Convention for International Terrorism (CCIT); and joint efforts for UN reform and the expansion of the UNSC.</p>
<p>As a result, some have suggested that Canada’s membership of the “United for Consensus” grouping that includes Pakistan, who oppose the expansion of the permanent members of the UNSC and push for more non permanent or “elected seats”, could hamper its chances of securing India’s votes.</p>

<p>‘Transactional votes’</p>
<p>However, former UN envoy Asoke Mukerji says that the decision for India and other countries will be made by balancing “favours” each country does for others within the UN system, and not as much on ideological differences.</p>
<p>“UN votes now are more transactional. It all depends on trade-offs, particularly where these countries have supported each other and what favours have been granted, run more like a banker’s ledger than political decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>The campaign for votes is made more difficult by the fact that the UNGA election process will be done by “secret ballot” and countries frequently break promises of support when they go to vote.</p>
<p>As a result, India is taking no chances with its campaign, and has added to its diplomatic push amongst UN missions and through its embassies in different countries, with telephone calls between PM Modi and his counterparts in more than 60 countries and multilateral groups like SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) and NAM, as well as dozens of others made by External Affairs Minister Jaishankar, since March this year.

<h3 id="india-elected-unopposed-to-non-permanent-seat-in-unsc">&ldquo;India elected unopposed to non-permanent seat in UNSC&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202006/un_gen_assembly_reuters-647x363.jpeg?2hsjiJPRETR9fzBXb5f.WEODYS.L1ciF" alt="img">
India has been elected to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as a non-permanent member from the Asia-Pacific category.</p>
<p>India has been elected as one of the non-permanent members to the UNSC with an overwhelming majority of 184 votes out of 192, where the minimum requirement was 128.</p>
<p>This was for the eighth time that India has been elected to UNSC. India has served seven times earlier: 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992 and 2011-2012.</p>

<p>India gets 184 out of the 192 valid votes polled. pic.twitter.com/Vd43CN41cY — India at UN, NY (@IndiaUNNewYork) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>India was the single candidate in the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) and is returning to the council after a decade starting January 2021. The last time India served at the UNSC was between 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>India was an unopposed candidate in the Asia-Pacific group and was endorsed last year in June by the APG after Afghanistan gave up its seat for India.</p>
<p>Three elections were held today at the UN headquarters in New York which opened for the first time since March 15 in wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The 193 members cast their ballots to elect: President of the next UNGA (75th UNGA), five UNSC non-permanent members of the UNSC and members of EcoSoc.</p>
<p>Indian envoy to UN, Ambassador Tirumurti, in an interview to India Today TV last week had said that he was “confident” of winning the seat and that India will represent those who do not have a voice in this elite group of 15.</p>
<p>“As I mentioned, Prime Minister has made a clarion call for reformed multilateralism. The status quo of the multilateral system is what some countries would like to revert to and reinforce. This does not reflect current realities. It is also not in the interest of developing countries, which have started playing a major role within the United Nations and outside, but, whose voices have not found traction in these multilateral bodies. Consequently, there is a need to go beyond 1940s multilateral architecture and provide for greater representation, starting with the UN Security Council. In other words, the multilateral architecture needs to get contemporary and reflect reality to be relevant”, he had said.</p>
<p>Since India was endorsed by the APG, the Indian mission in New York worked tirelessly to ensure that India’s win was a smooth one. The campaign started from the time of endorsement.</p>
<p>Sources told India Today TV that the mission reached out individually to all countries at multiple levels. The Permanent Representative of India to the UN, then Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin followed by Ambassador TS Tirumurti, engaged all the envoys of the 193 member nations individually.</p>
<p>The Deputy Permanent Representative of India to the UN, Nagaraj Naidu, engaged his country counterparts individually and in regional groups.</p>
<p>All 193 countries were divided among the officers of the mission. Each nodal officer reached out at his/her level to the bunch of countries assigned to them, keeping them abreast of all the developments and getting feelers of what they are thinking.</p>
<p>The minimum requirement for a seat in the group of 10 is a 2/3rd majority of the members present at the time of voting.</p>
<p>Voting Process:</p>
<p>The voting process indeed was a unique one. Keeping pandemic in mind, there were many conversations and virtual meetings that took place to decide on the procedure of voting.</p>
<p>The UN headquarters shut down on March 15 this year and many member states were apprehensive about holding the elections in the regular place, which is the main hall of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The voting could not have been rescheduled. Hence, through virtual meetings, consensus was reached on how to conduct the elections. Every detail was discussed, new procedures and rules were put in place to ensure a smooth sail through this hybrid voting process.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s key suggestions that were accepted:</p>
<p>India was one of the few countries with concrete suggestions, such as:</p>
<p>1.Elections in the main hall of the UNGA:</p>
<p>India had maintained that elections should be held in the main hall of the General Assembly with the President of the General Assembly seated on the podium observing the entire proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want anybody to question the sanctity of the elections&rdquo;, said a source.</p>
<p>Earlier, there was some view put forth on holding the election at the reception hall of the secretariat building.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Promotional material allowed:</li>
</ol>
<p>Every member was allowed to keep a sheet of paper with a campaign agenda on the table where the delegate came and sat to mark the ballot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is always good to remind people of what the focus of a country is going to be&rdquo;, the source said.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How to come and vote:</li>
</ol>
<p>India suggested that the member states could come in batches of 24 for the organisers to be able to manage the social distancing norms. It was agreed by all members.</p>
<p>The batches were not in alphabetical order so that member states did not sit beside each other.</p>
<p>All of them maintained distance and took all precautions while they went in to cast their ballot.</p>
<p>The five seats available for election in 2020 according to the regular distribution among regions were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One seat for the African Group (currently held by South Africa);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One seat for the Asia-Pacific Group (currently held by Indonesia);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One seat for the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC, currently held by the Dominican Republic); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two seats for the Western European and Others Group (WEOG, currently held by Belgium and Germany).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Seven member states, Canada, Djibouti, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, and Norway, stood for the five available seats.</p>
<p>Djibouti and Kenya contested the single African Group seat. Canada, Ireland and Norway contested the two WEOG seats. Mexico ran unopposed for the GRULAC seat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India ran unopposed for the Asia-Pacific seat.

<h3 id="turkish-diplomat-elected-president-of-historic-75th-un-general-assembly">&ldquo;Turkish diplomat elected President of historic 75th UN General Assembly&rdquo;</h3>

Wearing facemasks and practicing physical distancing, ambassadors from 192 UN Member States filed into the iconic but empty General Assembly Hall to cast their ballots during pre-determined time slots: an added layer of protection in the COVID-19 era.</p>
<p>In a one-of-a-kind election amid #COVID19, #UNGA elects @IndiaUNNewYork, @MexOnu, @irishmissionun, &amp; @NorwayUN as non-permanent members of the Security Council for 2-year terms.</p>
<p>A second round of voting will be held Thursday to fill the last vacant seat. https://t.co/svznemQth6 pic.twitter.com/HCzomD18Yb — United Nations (@UN) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>“Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have all had to work under extraordinary conditions to overcome the myriad of challenges facing us,” the current General Assembly President, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, said ahead of the elections.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” he added, “(they) represent our common commitment to ensuring the uninterrupted continuation of the important work of the United Nations, in accordance with the values and principles of the United Nations Charter.”</p>
<p>New faces in the Security Council, ECOSOC</p>
<p>Mr. Bozkir, a veteran diplomat and parliamentarian, will preside over the landmark 75th session of the UN General Assembly, which opens in September. He was the sole candidate for the post.</p>
<p>Ambassadors also voted for five new countries to join the UN Security Council as non-permanent members.</p>
<p>The Council comprises five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States – and 10 non-permanent members, who serve for two-year periods.</p>
<p>While three countries vied for two seats allocated to African and Asia-Pacific States, only India was confirmed. Djibouti and Kenya face a second round of voting to be held on Thursday.</p>
<p>A similar race occurred for the Western European and other States group, where Canada did not secure the required two-thirds majority, or 128 votes.</p>
<p>Norway and Ireland will begin their terms starting in January, as will Mexico, representative for the Latin America and Caribbean region.</p>
<p>Eighteen countries will also occupy vacant seats in the Economic and Social Council, another of the six main organs of the UN.</p>
<p>They are: Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Guatemala, Indonesia, Japan, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Portugal, the Solomon Islands, the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Preparing for September</p>
<p>While this year’s General Assembly falls during the UN’s 75th anniversary, the pandemic adds to its historic significance, and the need to maintain safety measures.</p>
<p>Plans are in motion for the annual high-level week, where Heads of State address the world from the dais in the General Assembly Hall.</p>
<p>Mr. Muhammad-Bande, the current President, has written to Member States about a scenario that foresees his successor and UN Secretary-General António Guterres present in the Hall for the official opening, while world leaders will deliver their speeches via pre-recorded video statements.</p>
<p>Delegations have until noon on Friday to submit their feedback.

<h3 id="indonesia-secures-seat-on-united-nations-economic-and-social-council">&ldquo;Indonesia secures seat on United Nations Economic and Social Council&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/01/22/2020_01_22_84968_1579667616._large.jpg" alt="img">
Indonesia has secured a seat on the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) for the 2021 to 2023 term.</p>
<p>The country gained 186 out of 190 votes as a representative from the Asia-Pacific region during a closed-door voting session at the UN headquarters in New York, United States, on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry stated.</p>
<p>It will be the 12th time Indonesia has held non-permanent membership on the council. The country has been appointed as the council’s president twice in 1970 and 2000.</p>
<p>As a member of the council, Indonesia is committed to actively achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>“Indonesia will double down on efforts to utilize its role to address strategic issues, especially under ECOSOC’s bodies, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization [FAO], World Health Organization [WHO], International Maritime Organization [IMO], International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO] and International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],” the statement read.</p>
<p>The ministry added that securing a seat on the ECOSOC was important for the country’s hopes to drive a post-COVID-19 economic and social recovery.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s membership will also be important to show global leadership in the achievement of SDGs and the advancement of national programs that are in line with the global development goals.</p>
<p>Read also: Sustainable development crucial in Indonesia’s COVID-19 recovery, experts say</p>
<p>Indonesia also holds non-permanent membership in two other UN bodies. Its membership on the UN Security Council will end in December while it will sit on the UN Human Rights Council for the 2020 to 2022 period.</p>
<p>The ECOSOC is one of six principal organs of the UN and is responsible for coordinating the economic and social fields of the organization, specifically in regard to the 15 specialized agencies, eight functional commissions and five regional commissions under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It consists of 54 member states, elected annually for overlapping three-year terms.</p>
<p>This year’s election of ECOSOC members was different from previous years, as a plenary meeting was not held to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The other Asia-Pacific countries elected to the council were Japan with 185 votes and Solomon Islands with 187.</p>
<p>Guatemala, Bolivia, Argentina and Mexico were elected to represent Latin America and the Caribbean, while Libya, Liberia, Nigeria, Madagascar and Zimbabwe were selected as representatives from Africa.</p>
<p>Bulgaria was the only Eastern European country to secure a seat, while Austria, Germany, Portugal, France and the United Kingdom were chosen to represent Western Europe.
