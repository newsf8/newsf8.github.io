<p>life-style, books,</p>
<p>Wendy Williams&rsquo;s book is a fascinating work of natural history, dealing with creatures that often seem almost too beautiful to be real. She recounts our gradual understanding of the butterfly - and its less beloved cousin, the moth - in an entertaining way. We learn of the ways people discovered the link between the lowly caterpillar, the cocoon, and the eventual butterfly. The epic journeys of some butterflies, notably from Canada and the northern United States to Mexico, are contrasted with butterflies who stay in the one place. Moths are found in far greater numbers throughout the world, as they evolved before flowering plants. The wonderful colours of butterflies are explored through the structure of the scales on their wings, and the nature of their eyes is also described. Each fact about the Lepidoptera is revealed engagingly, as we follow the author&rsquo;s search for information. Well-known people such as Charles Darwin and Vladimir Nabokov (a butterfly expert, as well as a novelist) are to be found in the pages, alongside lesser-known figures. Most remarkable is the story of 17th-century Maria Sibylla Merian, who mounted her own expedition of discovery, sailing to Suriname in 1699, specifically to find out more about butterflies. Williams writes that this was the first time anyone, male or female, crossed the Atlantic for the purposes of independent research. The only fault with the book is that, just occasionally, it seems to try a little too much to be amusing - for example, when she writes &ldquo;Even nighttime creatures like moths and bats and hermit crabs and teenage boys are ruled by the twenty-four-hour day&rdquo;. On the other hand, the convivial and personal tone throughout the book makes it accessible even for those with no scientific knowledge at all. One of the characteristics the author mentions a few times as humorous is the long-winded nature of 19th-century scientific book titles, such as Darwin&rsquo;s The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms: With Observations on Their Habits. It must be said that these are no longer than the extended title of the The Language of Butterflies, as given above! This is a lovely book, befitting its subject, and it is written in engaging prose. The last section, dealing with threats to the future of butterflies, adds a more sober tone. The Language of Butterflies presents a vivid portrait of these mysterious insects, and the people who have sought to understand, and to protect them.</p>

Michelle Reynolds where she’s happiest. Photo via Bob Farley</p>
<p>If you love the natural world and its creatures, you need to know Michelle Reynolds. Among other things, she’s a regular explorer of Birmingham’s urban wildlife, often posting gorgeous photos of her surprising discoveries so the rest of us can armchair travel with her. Keep reading to find out what I learned during our Q+A.</p>
<p>Tell us a little about yourself.</p>
<p>Gulf Fritillary. Wall hanging by Michelle Reynolds</p>
<p>Michelle Reynolds (MR): I am a fiber artist, a writer, habitat gardener, public speaker, and environmental educator. I am both a plant geek and a bird nerd. I like to tell stories about nature through photographs, my writing and with ecology-inspired fabric art.</p>
<p>How did you get into urban wildlife exploration?</p>
<p>Bob Farley/f8Photo.org — Ruffner Quarry, sunrise, cliffs, rocks</p>
<p>MR: I grew up in Guntersville exploring the woods, wading in creeks, and volunteering in the state park. My parents encouraged the kids to stay outside, and they took us hiking every weekend, educating us the whole time we were out.</p>
<p>When I moved to Birmingham, the first thing I did was ask people where are the woods. I love the city, but I need nature. I describe how I grew up in this article I wrote about nature apps. I am still a nature-loving wild child.</p>
<p>Have your urban wildlife explorations ramped up due to coronavirus, or has this been an enduring passion?</p>
<p>Lily in the yard. Photo via Michelle Reynolds</p>
<p>MR: It is an enduring passion, but I find myself searching more now. It is like meditation. It eases the stress of things.</p>
<p>I also find happiness in creating habitat in my own yard. It doesn’t take much effort to provide habitat essentials for wildlife to thrive and for us to enjoy. When I’m outside, in my yard or anywhere else, I like finding a little patch of wild.</p>
<p>I like observing the nature I can find in that spot, photographing what I find, uploading my observations to iNaturalist or eBird, and posting the photographs and experiences to social media.</p>
<p>I want people to see they don’t have to go far to find nature, that they can create nature around them, in their own yard and in their communities, and I want them to experience nature and gain joy from nature as I do. Whether we are aware of it or not, nature gives us a sense of calm, and we can sure use that during this pandemic.</p>
<p>But even in the best of times, we need not miss out on being inspired by nature in the city.</p>
<p>People might be surprised at the variety of places you find wildlife…</p>
<p>What gave you the idea to look in these types of places + what are some other unexpected places to find cool creatures?</p>
<p>MR: I look for vignettes of nature everywhere I go, and some of the things I find are in surprising places. You have to know the habitat of a plant or creature, and then you just look for those specific qualities as you scan locations.</p>
<p>There is a family of loggerhead shrikes living off of Finley Boulevard next to the interstate, a neighborhood, a train yard, and there is industry all around. You wouldn’t think such a thing would occur, but there they are.</p>
<p>Loggerhead shrikes are grassland birds that impale their prey on thorns and other sharp objects to cache for eating later. They have adapted to using agricultural lands with barbed wire fences for impaling prey, and they’ll use dense trees and cedar rows for nesting.</p>
<p>Looking around in the place this nesting pair calls home, there is a small field of grasses for the birds to prey upon insects, lots of barbed wire fencing for the birds to impale their prey, Village Creek for water and small aquatic prey, and a row of dense trees perfect for hiding and nesting. A friend of mine told me about seeing the shrikes there, and now I visit every week to see how mom, dad, and two chicks are doing.</p>
<p>What are some of your favorite places to go?</p>
<p>An eastern meadowlark at the Birmingham Airport. What do you think it’s saying? Photo via Michelle Reynolds</p>
<p>MR: In the urban setting, cemeteries, overgrown lots, old parking lots with cracked pavement and the airport are places I like to cruise around with my binoculars and camera. It’s important not to trespass or linger, but sometimes it’s tempting.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are many great designated parks and places to go around here: pocket gardens, green spaces, urban trails, and preserves to visit within the city limits or within a short distance—Birmingham City Parks, Railroad Park, Ruffner Mountain, Red Mountain, Turkey Creek, the Red Rock Trail, Ecoscapes, Cahaba River, Oak Mountain State Park … the list goes on.</p>
<p>How do you know what to look for?</p>
<p>MR: I look for native grasses and wildflowers, quality habitat, and signs of multiple species, especially birds and butterflies. Everything is connected.</p>
<p>Birds eat seeds, berries, or insects, and the baby birds eat lots of caterpillars, worms, grubs, and insects.</p>
<p>What do insects eat? They eat from plants. Not just any kind of plants, but they prefer to eat from native plants, or nectar and pollen, seed or fruit from native plants.</p>
<p>Why native plants? Native plants and native insects have evolved over time to suit each other’s needs. It’s complicated yet really simple, and butterflies and moths are good symbols for understanding how it all works.</p>
<p>Some butterflies and moths are specialists and will only lay eggs on their certain host plants. If I see maypops (passionvine) growing on a roadside or fence, I look for gulf fritillary butterflies and caterpillars.</p>
<p>If I see blooming yuccas in a cemetery, I cannot pass them by without stopping to turn up a flower and check for yucca moths.</p>
<p>What do you wish people knew about some of the creatures you document or about their habitat?</p>
<p>MR: I would like people to understand the importance of habitat. We should all work together to try to bridge the gap between fragments of habitat. Nature in the city is important, and we should try not to cause harm to the fragments of habitat that are in our concrete jungle.</p>
<p>We take for granted the power of native plants and the eco-services they provide. Plants help mitigate flooding and erosion, they sequester carbon and give us oxygen, they help clean our water, and many other things.</p>
<p>We should encourage the use of native plants in commercial landscapes, and we should not be so quick to destroy the natural, weedy and wild spots along roadsides or transportation corridors. Urban refuges are getting harder to find. So it is really important for us to create our own refuges if we want to live alongside wildlife.</p>
<p>I need to see wildlife on a daily basis. I work to manage the habitat gardens at Ruffner, and I have created a wildlife garden in my yard by planting native plants. I have worked to provide all of the habitat essentials in my yard — water, food, shelter, and places to rear young. These are the things we all need to survive.</p>
<p>What are some of your favorite creatures?</p>
<p>I like them all — bugs, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. The only animals I don’t like are outdoor cats… because they are sneaky little killers of wildlife, and they are not part of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I guess birds might be my favorite, and there are so many birds in the city using structures. Chimney swifts use chimneys for roosting and breeding. Cliff swallows build mud nests under overpasses. Barn swallows nest in rafters of industrial open-air buildings. These birds are fun to watch, and they eat insects on the wing all day. Natural pest control!</p>
<p>If someone were just getting started, what would you recommend to help them learn how to ID bugs, plants, birds + other creatures?</p>
<p>MR: My favorite book is Doug Tallamy’s Bringing Nature Home. He makes the case for gardening with native plants and explains everything in simple, down-to-earth terms.</p>
<p>I have a big collection of guidebooks, but I use online sources and apps just as much these days.</p>
<p>I love Facebook and Instagram for urban wildlife stories, and the sense of community from people and organizations makes me feel that we are all in this together.</p>
<p>I follow people like John Friel from the Natural History Museum in Tuscaloosa. He fosters a celebration of Alabama’s biodiversity in a most positive way.</p>
<p>Wood ducks at East Lake Park. Photo via Carla White</p>
<p>And I am inspired by curious folks who are just getting started in their journey to learn birds. I love Carla White’s photographs of the wood ducks and yellow-crowned night herons at East Lake Park that she posts on Alabama Birding Trail’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Expert birder Greg Harber photographs and tells stories about the wildlife at Railroad Park.</p>

<p>Updated: May 16, 2020 22:34 IST</p>
<p>Having rescued over 600 Sloth bears from the barbaric ‘dancing bear’ practice, the NGO, Wildlife SOS, found them unfit for release into the wilderness as they had suffered mutilation, physical and psychological trauma, and chronic medical complications. Their delicate muzzle had been pierced by hot iron pokers and teeth forcibly removed. Dental infections, rotting teeth and mouth ulcerations were common among ‘dancing bears’. Dental pain, as those among us who suffer it can testify, is the emperor of common maladies as it festers among countless nerves and blood vessels.</p>
<p>However, according to Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO, Wildlife SOS, “Veterinary dentistry is a specialisation badly needed in India as only a handful of specialists are working in this area.” Realising that dental surgery would lend a new life to suffering bears by effecting a remarkable change in their temperament and making them healthier and more active, the NGO went the extra mile by having their veterinarians trained by UK experts.</p>
<p>That expertise transformed the lives of the bears retained at the NGO’s rescue centres as they undergo regular dental procedures such as root canal treatment in cases of minimal damage, tooth extraction in cases of irreversible damage such as infected abscesses, and dental scaling to clean tartar build-up. Geriatric bears (older than 15 years) undergo regular dental scaling as neglect can lead to long-term damage to enamel and gums, making it very difficult for older bears to consume food.</p>
<p>“Recently, a bear named Durga upon receiving a root canal treatment showed improvement fairly quickly. Evidently no longer in pain, Durga is much more energetic and is back to munching on watermelons and dates!” Wildlife SOS spokesperson Arinita Sandilya told this writer.</p>
<p>SUNFLOWERS ON A MOTHY NIGHT</p>
<p>If butterflies are unchained flowers of our sunny gardens, moths are their mysterious counterparts designed to haunt the dark. On a sunflower at about 8pm in our Chandigarh garden, I observed a moth whose wings seemed touched by the lightness of lilac, evoking comparison to clouds doused in the goodbye glows of sunset. It was as if this beautiful creature had flown to the clouds in twilight and embraced that colour before taking wing on earth below to feed on sunflower nectar when the sun was no longer around.</p>

<p>I sought the expertise of the Hong Kong-based Dr Roger Kendrick, who is regarded as an authority on Asian moths, and Prof Jagbir Singh Kirti, head of zoology department, Punjabi University, Patiala. They were kind enough to identify this mostly unseen creature of Chandigarh as a species named, Thysanoplusia orichalcea, and distinguished it from the closely related and similar looking species, Thysanoplusia intermixta. Their expertise in distinguishing such cryptic species was revelatory!</p>
<p>Prof Kirti recalls trapping this moth species in Chandigarh in 1979 while he was an MSc student at the Panjab University. Having worked extensively on moths across India, he discovered a 100 moth species and recently donated 10,000 specimens of his lifetime work to augment the collections of the Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata.</p>
<p>Unlike bird species, which enjoy common Punjabi names, moths are little seen and thus are generically known as ‘Patangas’ in the vernacular. “While we know that honeybees are pollinators, moths perform the same task by sucking nectar from flowers and juice from fruits at night, thus gathering pollen and dispersing it. This moth species is commonly known in English as the Soyabean looper as it is regarded as a pest on that crop when it is a caterpillar feeding voraciously on Soyabean leaves. However, moths predate our crops in evolutionary history and were forced to shift to eating crops because humanity destroyed their natural habitats. So, they have suffered a negative connotation in popular consciousness for no fault of their own,” Prof Kirti told this writer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/05/12/TELEMMGLPICT000230076840-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVfKYF8F8biotmZZgOU3KXzVjzHypXi6fM6HNRKf2oe8.jpeg?imwidth=1200" alt="img">
Moths are &lsquo;super-pollinators&rsquo;, a new study has found, as experts say the &lsquo;overlooked&rsquo; insects are just as important to our crops as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>While we often see bees having a nose in the daisies and butterflies fluttering to our garden flowers, moths &lsquo;secretly&rsquo; pollinate a significant number of plants under the cover of darkness.</p>
<p>The research by UCL scientists, published in Biology Letters, shows that moth pollen transport networks are larger and more complex than networks for daytime pollinators such as bumblebees. This means they could play a very important role in crop yields.</p>
<p>The study was conducted from 2016-2017 on Norfolk farmland and nocturnal moth communities and daytime pollinators were surveyed once a month to see which plants they visited and how frequently. Of the 838 moths swabbed, 381 moths (45.5 per cent) were found to transport pollen. In total pollen from 47 different plant species was detected, including at least seven rarely visited by bees, hoverflies and butterflies.</p>
<p>Many insects transport pollen on their tongues, but interestingly the study shows that moths transport pollen most frequently on their chests, allowing it to be easily transferred to other plants. Their hairy bodies mean they can pick up and carry many pollen particles at a time.</p>
<p>Lead author of the study, Dr Richard Walton said: “Nocturnal moths have an important but overlooked ecological role. They complement the work of daytime pollinators, helping to keep plant populations diverse and abundant.</p>
<p>“Previous studies of pollen transport among settling moths have focused on their proboscis. However, settling moths sit on the flower while feeding, with their often distinctly hairy bodies touching the flower’s reproductive organs. This happy accident helps pollen to be easily transported during subsequent flower visits.”</p>
<p>Scientists are concerned as moth populations are taking a nosedive across the world, which means that they are disappearing just as we discover their important role in pollination.</p>
<p>Dr Jan Axmacher, who also worked on the study, said: “In recent decades, there has been a lot of science focus on solitary and social bees driven by concerns about their dramatic decline and the strong negative effect this has had on insect-pollinated crop yields.</p>
<p>“In contrast, nocturnal settling moths - which have many more species than bees - have been neglected by pollination research. Our study highlights an urgent need for them to be included in future agricultural management and conservation strategies to help stem declines, and for more research to understand their unique and vital role as pollinators, including their currently unknown role in crop pollination.”

Have you noticed an explosion of butterflies?</p>
<p>The prolonged drought followed by recent rains has seen a breeding frenzy across South East Queensland.</p>
<p>An absolute abundance of butterflies and moths are fluttering around trees with gardens awash with all kinds of insects.</p>

<p>The curator of entomology at the Queensland Museum, Dr Christine Lambkin, said it was great to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People have been saying for so long, &lsquo;Where have all the insects gone?&rsquo; — well, they are back again,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have finally had the rain and all these butterflies and other insects have all emerged and are out and trying to finish off their life cycle in preparation for the next year.</p>
<p>Experts say the population explosion is due to recent rain. ( ABC News: Lucas Hill )</p>
<p>&ldquo;The insects are massively responding to the heat and humidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most prolific at the moment along Queensland&rsquo;s south-east coast is the lemon migrant butterfly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can get one to sit still, you are very lucky because these guys fly very, very fast — about two to seven metres above the ground and they don&rsquo;t sit still,&rdquo; Dr Lambkin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normally they last one to two weeks but they could be around for up to three weeks this year.</p>
<p>Lemon migrant butterflies are a common sight around southern Queensland right now. ( australianbutterflies.com )</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is later than usual as you would normally expect this influx before Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unusual thing is the large number of the dark form of lemon migrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the dark form that tends to do these massive migrations,&rdquo; Dr Lambkin said.</p>
<p>The number of blue tiger butterflies in Brisbane have also soared. ( ABC News: Lucas Hill )</p>
<p>Blue triangle butterflies have also been out in large numbers along with butterflies that feed on citrus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also just starting to get reports of blue tigers which have black and blue spots and we will possibly get a migration of those as well,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most caterpillars are moths — rather than butterfly caterpillars — and we are getting lots of reports of large numbers of caterpillars across the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The museum has received numerous reports of outbreaks of insects from Western Queensland.</p>
<p>There have been reports of large numbers of gidgee bugs in Western Queensland. ( ABC News: Julia Harris )</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have also had gidgee bugs and field crickets out west and the big green ground beetle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She warned gardeners to be wary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is very little you can do generally — just keep an eye on your plants and pull off the caterpillars and grasshoppers as you find them,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>A long-haul truck driver also told the ABC the butterflies are not confined to the state&rsquo;s south east.</p>
<p>He said he had to stop to wash butterflies from his windscreen after driving 150 kilometres south from Mackay, then had to do so again by the time he reached Rockhampton.

A new project to track Australia&rsquo;s butterflies takes flight today.</p>
<p>Key points: Researchers hope members of the public could discover a new species</p>

<p>Amateur butterfly-watchers can be part of a science project which aims to track and conserve the insects by creating a database of sightings across Australia</p>
<p>Budding butterfly chasers are being encouraged to download a new app, Butterflies Australia, to record and upload which butterflies they have seen and where.</p>
<p>In Australia, there are currently eight butterfly species listed as threatened, but experts believe as many as 38 are potentially under threat of extinction.</p>
<p>Brisbane-based butterfly expert Chris Sanderson from Butterflies Australia said the information gathered will give scientists crucial information that will help protect at-risk species.</p>
<p>The data gathered in the project will be sent to researchers at Australian National University. ( Supplied: Chris Sanderson )</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butterflies are one of our best known insect species, but there&rsquo;s a serious lack of scientific data about them,&rdquo; Mr Sanderson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know very little about butterflies but we do know that they are very important for the environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are about 440 butterfly species in Australia and researchers are optimistic the project will identify new species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who takes part in this project could be the person to make the next big discovery,&rdquo; Mr Sanderson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butterflies are an excellent species to target as they are active during the day and often large and brightly coloured, making them easier to spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty of catching up to do. In the Atlas of Living Australia there are currently less than 250,000 records for butterflies, compared to 40 million for birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The app includes a field guide to help identify every species of butterfly found in Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who want to learn about butterflies can see pictures and read information and it will be a handy reference for when you&rsquo;re in the field,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll also be able to record the butterfly that you&rsquo;re seeing either with a photograph or putting a identification in and that gets turned into a GPS location that gets sent to our experts and become a data point for research.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to make it as easy as possible for people to get involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Researchers at Australian National University (ANU) will analyse the data.</p>
<p>ANU Associate Professor and Entomologist Michael Braby said the project will be hugely important for the future of butterfly research in Australia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is critical need to get accurate information on the distribution of butterflies. Such data will assist in conservation planning and decision-making regarding land use,&rdquo; Professor Braby said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will also help us assess how species are changing over time, for example, in relation to climate change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Sanderson hopes that a species of butterfly that hasn&rsquo;t been seen in Queensland and Northern New South Wales for almost 20 years may be spotted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that I&rsquo;m most hoping that people will find is the Laced Fritillary that was found from Gympie to about Port Macquarie in NSW,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been seen since 2002 … there&rsquo;s been no evidence that they exists for a very long time now, so it would be lovely if we could show that they are still around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The app is available for download for free from today and the project team will also be conducting workshops around the country until May next year.</p>
<p>More information is available on the Butterflies Australia website and on Facebook page.</p>
<p>The project has been funded by a grant from the Federal Department of Industry, Innovation and Science.

<h3 id="insect-experts-catching-moths-to-see-if-their-nz-population-has-declined">&ldquo;Insect experts catching moths to see if their NZ population has declined&rdquo;</h3>

Insect experts are recreating the work of entomologist George Hudson in an attempt to find out if moth species have changed at Zealandia in Wellington.</p>
<p>Your playlist will load after this ad</p>
<p>Among the group catching moths and comparing the results with Mr Hudson’s study in the same valley 100 years ago is his grandson, George Gibbs.</p>
<p>“It’s almost genetic. I guess I started my first moths when I was about seven, that’s 80, 70 years ago,” Mr Gibbs said.</p>
<p>His grandfather spent 24 years documenting and hand-painting New Zealand’s moths and butterflies, publishing The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand in 1928.</p>

<p>George Hudson was also a pioneer for daylight saving, proposing the idea to the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1895.</p>
<p>“It was to do with his habit of wanting to be outdoors when the weather was good and when he could find moths and other insects.”</p>
<p>Mr Gibbs said investigating moth populations on the same site as his grandfather a century on is special.</p>
<p>“Just a sort of sense of awe on my part as to what he achieved.</p>
<p>“He’s the only person I’ve ever come across who’s had a goal and an ideal at age 14 and lived it to the end,” he said.</p>
<p>Department of Conservation ecology science advisor Eric Edwards said the long-term study aims to provide some facts around anecdotal evidence that moth are in decline in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“There’s those crazy stories of insect decline worldwide, you know Insectageddon, and what’s the New Zealand version of that story?” he said.</p>
<p>He said he predicts they’ll find more exotic moths than were present in Karori during Mr Hudson’s research.</p>
<p>Zealandia director Danielle Shanahan said the opportunity to compare the results with the historic research will help the organisation find out what moth species are present and what are missing from what used to be in the area &hellip; and be able to potentially try and attract those sorts of species again&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Moths are plant pollinators and an important food source for other animals.</p>
<p>The third search found 44 species of moth with the team hoping to find more in the warmer months, Mr Edwards said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We plan to continue to survey in all seasons over next couple of years so that the effort is like Hudson’s effort,” he said in a statement.
