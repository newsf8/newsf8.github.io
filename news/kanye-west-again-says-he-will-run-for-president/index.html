<p>US rapper Kanye West has said he is running for president, potentially pitting him against a man he says he admires, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;I am running for president of the United States!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife Kim Kardashian West and entrepreneur Elon Musk endorsed him.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s unclear whether West is really running.</p>
<p>He does not appear to have registered his name with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for November&rsquo;s election. The closest name the FEC database shows is a candidate called &ldquo;Kanye Deez Nutz West&rdquo;, who filed their papers with the Green Party in 2015 under the address &ldquo;1977 Golddigger Avenue, Suite Yeezus&rdquo; and appears to have raised no money.</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @kanyewest We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States 🇺🇸! #2020VISION — ye (@kanyewest) July 5, 2020 Report</p>
<p>It is also not the first time West has claimed that he is running for the White House.</p>
<p>At the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, he said he had decided to run for president in 2020.</p>
<p>But last November he pushed the date back, saying he would actually run in the 2024 contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he asked the crowd at Fast Company&rsquo;s Innovation Festival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have created so many jobs that I&rsquo;m not gonna run, I&rsquo;m gonna walk,&rdquo; he said, adding he was considering changing his name for the run to &ldquo;Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In his tweet on Saturday, US Independence Day, West, 43, did not say if his supposed run would be affiliated with a particular political party.</p>
<p>In any case, contesting the nomination of one major parties would be impossible at this stage, with the election only four months away.</p>
<p>In order to appear on the ballot as an independent candidate, West would have to gather a certain amount of signatures and register in states by a particular deadline. The deadline has already passed in some major states but the music star would still technically have time to file in many others.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s contest is likely to be a straight battle between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>In 2018, West made a bizarre appearance at the White House with President Trump during which he wore a Make America Great Again hat and made an expletive-filled rant that Mr Trump described as &ldquo;quite something&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love this guy right here,&rdquo; West said, walking behind the desk to hug the seated president, who said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rapper also pushed back on the idea that African-Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic Party voters, saying: &ldquo;People expect that if you&rsquo;re black, you have to be Democrat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian West retweeted her husband&rsquo;s statement about the presidential run with an American flag.</p>
<p>She has in recent years become a significant voice in the US movement for criminal justice reform and has successfully lobbied President Trump to release several prisoners.

Kanye West announced that he was running for president in a tweet on July 4, 2020.</p>
<p>“We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future,” he wrote. “I am running for president of the United States 🇺🇸! #2020VISION.”</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian West retweeted her husband’s message, simply adding an emoji of the American flag to show her support in his newest endeavor.</p>
<p>West’s announcement was met with mixed feelings from celebrities, fans and social media users.</p>

<p>Comedian and actress Tiffany Haddish made a parody of West’s tweet, crafting her own announcement to a similar tune.</p>
<p>“We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future,” she wrote, copying the opening line to West’s tweet. “I too am running for president of the United States 🇺🇸! #2020VISION.”</p>
<p>Haddish responded to her own tweet, revealing her “running mate” for her bid, “So #HaddishChappelle2020.”</p>
<p>The actress engaged with some discourse with fans who challenged her choice of vice president.</p>
<p>“Not Chapelle. You can do better! Trevor Noah!!” one fan wrote, to which Haddish replied, “He Isn’t America Born but he could be the press secretary.”</p>

<p>Octavia Spencer expressed her own opinions on the announcement, first tweeting, &ldquo;Too much foolishness today. #SitAllTheWayDown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Academy Award-winning actress continued, adding, &ldquo;It’s obvious that some people live in a bubble. It’s about time to burst it. #2020vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fuller House&rdquo; star Bob Saget followed in the steps of Hilton and Haddish, asking if he should also run for president. The actor followed up the next day, writing, &ldquo;I have a BIG announcement to make!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, as a joke, I tweeted and asked if I should run for President too&hellip;. But thanks to all your kind support, I’ve made a decision&hellip; Stand by, ‘cause HERE IT COMES&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Reuters, it&rsquo;s not clear whether or not West has filed any official paperwork in order to appear on election ballots, but the deadline to add independent candidates has passed in many states.

Rapper Kanye West is loving the frenzy he touched off during fireworks, and he&rsquo;s retweeting every story about him running for president, from the Philippine Star to Reuters.</p>
<p>Reality check: Kanye announced last year that he&rsquo;d run in 2024. The hurdles to getting on enough ballots for Nov. 3 (121 days) are beyond formidable, and the date is late. (Shhh! Don&rsquo;t tell Twitter!)</p>
<p>As ABC&rsquo;s Terry Moran put it on the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; roundtable: &ldquo;These are serious times. &hellip; We have two old men running for office. America is a tomorrow country. I think the person who better defines what tomorrow looks like is going to win. My hunch is that&rsquo;s not gonna be Kanye. &hellip; His videos will be great, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;

Kanye West attends Sunday Service at The Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York on Sept. 29, 2019 in New York City.</p>
<p>On Independence Day, Kanye West tweeted that he&rsquo;s running for president. It&rsquo;s not the first time the rapper has declared an interest in taking over the Oval Office. At the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, he announced at the end of his 11-minute Video Vanguard Award acceptance speech that he&rsquo;s aiming for the highest office: &ldquo;I have decided in 2020 to run for president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that wife Kim Kardashian is showing her support after his latest announcement. She retweeted the rapper&rsquo;s July 4 message with an emoji of the American flag. Entrepreneur Elon Musk is also backing Ye, tweeting in response to West&rsquo;s announcement: &ldquo;You have my full support!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how does the music community feel about Yeezy 2020? Reactions were mixed after West, who recently dropped new tune &ldquo;Wash Us in the Blood&rdquo; featuring Travis Scott and has been a vocal Donald Trump supporter, made his unexpected holiday announcement. Some even mocked him.</p>
<p>Among those poking fun was comedian Tiffany Haddish, who revealed in 2019 she&rsquo;s working on a music album. She quoted Kanye&rsquo;s tweet, but changed the last sentence: &ldquo;We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I too am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some, such as actor and Band of Ghosts lead singer Eric Balfour, were not amused by the declaration. &ldquo;Do you guys think this is all a joke? That potentially pulling votes away from the only nominee who can defeat Donald Trump is cute or funny?&rdquo; he responded to West&rsquo;s tweet. &ldquo;This is the height of privilege ultimately it won&rsquo;t hurt you, you&rsquo;re wealthy enough to survive 4 more years of Trump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>See what the rapper&rsquo;s fellow music makers have to say about him throwing his hat in the ring just months before the presidential election.</p>

<p>Kim, 39, is standing by her husband&rsquo;s decision as he tries to take on the monumental task of being the next President of the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kanye has been planning this for years and Kim has known about his aspirations and has been supportive,&rdquo; a source told Us Weekly on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kanye is passionate about arts and education and wants to support in any way he can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just yesterday, the father of four told fans he’s got “2020 vision” and has his sights set on the country’s highest political position. Kanye tweeted: “We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. “I am running for president of the United States Flag of United States!” Elon, 49, soon replied, telling Ye: “You have my full support!” This comes just days after Kanye posted a photo of himself and Elon hanging out at home together, captioning the shot: “When you go to your boys house and you’re both wearing orange.” 7 Kim wants to be supportive in any way she can Credit: Splash News</p>
<p>Kanye&rsquo;s wife Kim later added his tweet to her Instagram Stories and also retweeted him while adding an American flag emoji.</p>
<p>Shortly after the rapper, who released his new song Wash Us in the Blood earlier this week, made his big announcement on Saturday, #Kanye2020 began trending on Twitter.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time Kim’s husband has brought up the idea of running for United States president.</p>
<p>He first mentioned it in 2016 during his acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p>
<p>He told his fellow artists at the event and all the viewers at home: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I fittin&rsquo; to lose after this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter, though; It&rsquo;s not about me.</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s about ideas. New ideas. People with ideas. People who believe in truth.</p>
<p>“And yes, as you probably could&rsquo;ve guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020 to run for president.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It comes as the A-list pair has been dogged by split rumors after reports of tension in lockdown.</p>
<p>However, friends think a formal split is the last thing on her mind.</p>
<p>“Things are tough between Kim and Kanye because they never normally spend this much time together, but she doesn’t want a divorce,” an insider told The Sun.</p>
<p>“She considers her marriage to Kanye and their family together a huge success - she’s the only sister who is married and thinks of herself and Kanye as a power couple.</p>
<p>“The last thing she wants is a divorce - especially because the public backlash after her second divorce was unbearable.</p>
<p>“What I think will happen is they’ll spend time apart in different houses - but not divorce.”</p>

<p>The couple has been splitting their time between their $19m LA home and Kanye’s Wyoming ranch in lockdown - with a source telling The Sun that the couple was finding spending so much time together tough.</p>
<p>The source said: &ldquo;Kim and Kanye are arguing and at each other&rsquo;s throats during this pandemic. Kim is getting stir crazy, as she&rsquo;s used to being on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a lot of time alone with the kids for her. She is frustrated with Kanye, and thinks he&rsquo;s not pulling his weight in family responsibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been staying at opposite ends of the house to keep things civil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When did Kanye West and Kim Kardashian get married? Kim started dating Kanye in April 2012, six months after she split from NBA player Kris Humphries. They welcomed their first daughter, North West, in June 2013 and tied the knot one year later in Italy. The couple has four kids: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. The Hollywood couple started having issues during quarantine, when they both found themselves trying to spend more time together with their kids.</p>

<p>Kim shared two behind-the-scenes pictures of the two and captioned the sweet post: &ldquo;6 years down; forever to go&hellip;Until the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They have four children together: North, 6, Saint, 4, Chicago, 2, and Psalm, 1.

Kanye West announced on Saturday, July 4, that he is running for president of the United States against President Donald Trump and Joe Biden.</p>
<p>“We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION,” the rapper, 43, tweeted.</p>
<p>We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States 🇺🇸! #2020VISION — ye (@kanyewest) July 5, 2020</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Elon Musk replied, “You have my full support!” and the rapper quickly trended on Twitter with First Lady also becoming a trending topic, as fans and critics pondered the idea of Kim Kardashian ending up in the White House with her husband. The KKW Beauty founder retweeted her husband’s statement along with an American flag emoji.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time the “Famous” singer has talked about running for office — back in 2015 he surprised viewers at the MTV Video Music Awards by announcing a possible run in 2020.</p>
<p>Most recently West spoke about his political aspirations at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in NYC in November.</p>
<p>“When I run for President in 2024,” he said as the audience began laughing. “What y’all laughing at? We would create so many jobs! I’m not going to run, I’m going to walk. When you see headlines saying Kanye’s crazy — one in three African Americans are in jail and all the celebrities are in jail also because they can’t say nothing, they got no opinion, they’re so scared!”</p>
<p>The Yeezy designer, who has been spending a lot of time at his ranch in Wyoming in recent months, has previously been a vocal supporter of President Trump, visiting the former reality TV star in the Oval Office in 2018 and courting controversy by wearing a red Make America Great Again cap.</p>
<p>He also implied in April that he planned to vote for the businessman in November.</p>
<p>“We know who I’m voting on,” he said in an interview with GQ. “And I’m not going to be told by the people around me and the people that have their agenda that my career is going to be over. Because guess what: I’m still here!”</p>
<p>West’s wife has also met with Trump multiple times at the White House as she advocates for criminal justice reform.
