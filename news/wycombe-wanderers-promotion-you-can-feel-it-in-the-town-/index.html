<p>Image caption Aston Bowring (right) and his friend Luke Huggett were celebrating in High Wycombe on Tuesday</p>
<p>Wycombe Wanderers have reached the second tier of English football for the first time in their 133-year history after a dramatic play-off final victory. BBC News went to the Buckinghamshire town the morning after the night before to see what promotion means to the area.</p>
<p>High Wycombe has only had a Football League club since 1993 and the team, nicknamed the Chairboys, narrowly avoided dropping out again on a dramatic final day of the season six years ago.</p>
<p>But at a near-empty Wembley Stadium on Monday night, Joe Jacobson&rsquo;s penalty gave them a 2-1 victory over Oxford United in the League One play-off final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The final whistle went and literally brought me to tears, the amount of stuff the club has been through,&rdquo; said 16-year-old Aston Bowring, who was still celebrating in the Buckinghamshire town on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can kind of feel it in the town, we&rsquo;ve already had people coming up and asking us how the game went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve put Wycombe on the map, we weren&rsquo;t on the map before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The promotion has certainly put Wycombe on the map, typified by Premier League winners Liverpool&rsquo;s manager Jurgen Klopp recording a message for striker Adebayo Akinfenwa following his memorable post-match interview.</p>

<p>The outbreak of coronavirus suspended the end of the League One season, but Wycombe - who were eighth at the time - made the play-offs when the final standings were decided on average points-per-game.</p>
<p>James Crawley, who watched the game in his garden, said &ldquo;people needed something&rdquo; to hold on to during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent the whole time just looking forward to the play-offs, as soon as it was announced everyone was like &lsquo;we can get through this - it&rsquo;s only four weeks to the play-offs&rsquo;, then sure enough it&rsquo;s counting down,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Wycombe - who were only promoted to the division in 2018 - began the season as one of the candidates for relegation back to League Two, but instead they will be facing teams with Premier League pedigree, players and stadiums to match next year.</p>
<p>Mr Crawley, 21, said: &ldquo;Even getting to League One and staying up was huge, and now we&rsquo;re in the Championship which is crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a 10,000-seater stadium, there&rsquo;s silly money in the Championship and we&rsquo;ll be there with a fairly modest budget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image caption James Crawley watched the final in his garden</p>
<p>Businesses in High Wycombe, like everywhere else in the UK, are coming to terms with how best to move forward as the coronavirus lockdown continues to ease.</p>
<p>Melanie Williams, chief executive of High Wycombe Business Improvement District, said that footfall in the town had been &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; and they had expected the centre to be busier.</p>
<p>She said she hoped promotion would &ldquo;encourage people to come back to town and shop, trade locally again and celebrate together&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in a period of international lockdown and international crisis as we know and we saw in that time a huge amount of community solidarity,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about how we can recover. I think this [promotion] just comes at a moment in time when we really want something to celebrate but also build on that community that we have seen be so effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say High to Wycombe</p>
<p>Image caption Wycombe&rsquo;s football team will play in England&rsquo;s second tier next season</p>
<p>Found in the Chilterns, the town was inhabited by the Romans and is named in the Domesday book</p>
<p>Wycombe was the heartbeat of the UK&rsquo;s chair-making industry in the 19th Century and is where their team&rsquo;s nickname, The Chairboys, stems from</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s furniture-making skills were used for aircraft components during World War Two</p>
<p>The area&rsquo;s predominant industry is now the service sector</p>
<p>While child poverty in Buckinghamshire is lower than the national average, a 2016 study found Wycombe had the highest rate in the county</p>

<p>Moving up into a division stocked full of well-supported sides, many of which have been in the Premier League, will almost certainly mean an increase in away support on matchdays when fans are allowed to return to games.</p>
<p>Steve Langton, 75, runs a market stall selling martial arts-related items each Saturday and hopes the town could profit from the rise in away support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope it will get busier,&rdquo; he said, adding: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope they&rsquo;ll spend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fans also think the town centre should be getting a new feature in homage to the Chairboys&rsquo; talismanic manager, who also moonlights as the lead singer with rock band The Cold Blooded Hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Gareth Ainsworth&rsquo;s going to have a statue in the town centre sometime soon,&rdquo; Mr Crawley said.</p>

<h3 id="oxford-united-1-2-wycombe-wanderers-chairboys-promoted-to-championship">&ldquo;Oxford United 1-2 Wycombe Wanderers: Chairboys promoted to Championship&rdquo;</h3>

Captain Matt Bloomfield and manager Gareth Ainsworth celebrate Wycombe&rsquo;s promotion to the Championship - six years after they escaped relegation from League Two with the Chairboys</p>
<p>Wycombe Wanderers will play in the second tier of English football for the first time next season after edging past Oxford United in the League One play-off final at Wembley.</p>
<p>A tense and tight contest was settled by a Joe Jacobson penalty with just over 10 minutes to play after Fred Onyedinma was fouled by Oxford goalkeeper Simon Eastwood.</p>
<p>Wycombe had taken an early lead when centre-back Anthony Stewart headed in a dangerous Jacobson corner via a deflection off Eastwood.</p>
<p>Oxford found a second-half equaliser when Mark Sykes lobbed Ryan Allsop with what appeared to be a mishit cross, but the U&rsquo;s could not capitalise further during what was their best spell of the game.</p>
<p>Wycombe&rsquo;s victory capped off an incredible season for the Buckinghamshire club, who almost dropped out of the English Football League in 2014 and arguably started this campaign as relegation candidates based on their bottom-six finish the previous season.</p>
<p>Added to that, when the regular season was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Chairboys were outside the play-off places in the third tier.</p>
<p>But when the final league standings were determined on an unweighted points-per-game basis, Gareth Ainsworth&rsquo;s side leapt up to third to book their shot at promotion.</p>
<p>After seeing off Fleetwood Town in their play-off semi-final, they got the better of their neighbours from just up the M40 in what was a pulsating affair.</p>
<p>Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth is the longest-serving manager in the top four divisions of English football</p>
<p>Chairboys make fast start</p>
<p>Wycombe took the lead from their first corner of the game as left-back Jacobson caused panic in the Oxford defence, his left-footed inswinger catching out goalkeeper Eastwood who was unable to punch it clear.</p>
<p>Stewart was on the end of it at the back post to head towards goal and the final touch into the net came off Eastwood&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>Stewart found himself in the thick of Oxford&rsquo;s best chance to equalise, making a brilliant interception to deny Matty Taylor a simple finish.</p>
<p>Moments earlier, Sam Long had fired a shot across goal inches wide after linking up well with Sykes down the right wing.</p>
<p>U&rsquo;s show fight with Sykes&rsquo; surprise strike</p>
<p>Oxford came out with the more attacking intent after the break and despite their continued pressure, their equaliser came relatively out of the blue.</p>
<p>Sykes once more found space down the right wing and as he seemed set to send in a cross, he actually managed to find the far corner after lobbing the ball over an outstretched Allsop.</p>
<p>Whether or not it was an intentional finish seemed to matter little as Oxford continued to force the game.</p>
<p>Another timely last-ditch Stewart interception prevented Taylor from tapping into an empty net, while Rob Dickie had powerful headers from two successive set-pieces parried away by the Wycombe goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Jacobson the coolest customer on sticky Wembley stage</p>
<p>Wycombe left-back Joe Jacobson&rsquo;s 12th goal of the season secured victory in the League One play-off final</p>
<p>Ultimately, they would prove to be chances that Oxford spurned while on top as Wycombe&rsquo;s patience was rewarded when they forced the mistake that led to the match-winning penalty.</p>
<p>A long ball over the top caused confusion in Oxford&rsquo;s back line as at first Eastwood stayed on his line, and then came out too late to get to the ball first.</p>
<p>Wycombe forward Onyedinma had got just enough of a touch on the ball before he was flattened in the area and referee Rob Jones had no hesitation awarding a spot-kick, which Jacobson fired home down the middle.</p>
<p>That would prove to be the winning moment as Allsop kept his cool at the other end to gather a couple more headers on goal from Taylor and Dickie, and that meant the Wycombe celebrations were loud and proud come full-time.</p>
<p>Promotion to Championship &lsquo;just surreal&rsquo; - reaction to Wycombe&rsquo;s win</p>
<p>Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amazing feeling. To take this club into the Championship is just surreal, it&rsquo;s beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today is just the culmination of all the desire and heart of all those boys out there on the pitch. They absolutely delivered and then some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the greatest game we&rsquo;ve played in the world. This was always going to be cagey. My goalkeeper has made two world-class saves, they really came at us and are a good side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was destined today. There are 25 individual stories that have ended in the Championship and I&rsquo;m so proud of the boys. They&rsquo;ve been amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oxford manager Karl Robinson: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been done early on by a goal that you&rsquo;d expect to come from the opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The longer the game went on, I thought we played wonderfully well and we missed some key chances as important stages in the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the things that were out of our control didn&rsquo;t fall for us. We&rsquo;ve probed and just not taken our chance. The mistakes that we made were small errors and unfortunately it&rsquo;s cost us.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2020/07/PRI_157753875.jpg" alt="img">
Adebayo Akinfenwa and Jurgen Klopp’s budding bromance indicative of Wycombe Wanderers’ fairytale rise The veteran striker’s reward for helping Gareth Ainsworth’s side clinch a second promotion in seven years is an invitation to Liverpool’s Premier League victory parade</p>
<p>These are indeed extraordinary times.</p>
<p>As if Wycombe Wanderers’ elevation to the second tier of the English game for the first time in their 133-year history were not enough of a story, their League One play-off victory over Oxford United came with an extra fairy tale on top: a budding bromance between Adebayo Akinfenwa and Jürgen Klopp.</p>
<p>The spark for this brief encounter between two of the sport’s larger-than-life characters was Akinfenwa’s ebullient post-match interview in which he recalled his release by AFC Wimbledon after scoring a penalty in a League Two play-off final triumph in 2016 – and mentioned the Liverpool manager.</p>
<p>“Four years ago I was here and I was technically unemployed,” said Wycombe’s 38-year-old, 16-stone centre-forward. “Let me tell you something, the only person who can hit me up on WhatsApp this time is Klopp so we can celebrate together.”</p>
<p>Klopp, who had been watching Monday’s match to monitor Liverpool’s Oxford loanee Ben Woodburn, duly responded with a video message and kindled the connection further in his press conference yesterday by explaining that he had received a return message from the Wycombe man and was inviting Akinfenwa to his team’s Premier League title parade.</p>
<p>“He is invited for the parade, 100%,” said Klopp. “I saw when he was sitting in the team meeting in a Liverpool kit, which I thought was really funny.”</p>
<p>In response, Akinfenwa tweeted: “This is getting silly now, I’m smiling like a grown kid.”</p>
<p>Klopp ???? Akinfenwa Last night Adebayo Akinfenwa asked Jurgen Klopp to &lsquo;hit him up on Whatsapp&rsquo; after Wycombe&rsquo;s promotion and the Liverpool manager didn&rsquo;t disappoint! pic.twitter.com/pZGicPDPC8 — Sky Sports (@SkySports) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>In fairness, with Gareth Ainsworth as his manager, Akinfenwa has little need for the one-time architect of heavy metal football. The cowboy boots that Ainsworth wore on the touchline on Monday were a nod to his much-documented sideline as a singer in an INXS tribute band.</p>
<p>Certainly the 47-year-old must be the first manager at Wembley who has supported Doctor &amp; The Medics, and Monday night was not the sole first for a man who had previously lost play-offs finals as a player, with Preston North End in 1994, and manager, with Wycombe in 2015.</p>
<p>When English football’s longest-serving manager sat down with i in November to reflect on a decade since his arrival at the club, initially as a player, he discussed the re-energising impact of American businessman Rob Couhig’s arrival last summer as Wycombe’s new majority shareholder.</p>
<p>Prior to Couhig’s arrival, Ainsworth had had to release nine players. Now albeit with a “bottom-quarter” budget, Couhig had him dreaming of the Championship as he overlooked overtures from elsewhere and looked at trails blazed by Chris Wilder, Eddie Howe and Sean Dyche.</p>
<p>“Two years ago we’d have been ‘Oh my word this is totally unrealistic’,” he told me. “Now we’re thinking, ‘Do you know what, it isn’t so stupid’.”</p>
<p>Today the Championship is a reality. When lockdown came, Wycombe sat eighth in League One. The rejigging of the standings on a points-per game basis lifted them to third. After a 6-3 aggregate play-off semi-final victory over Fleetwood Town, they took the final step with Monday’s 2-1 success.</p>
<p>Yesterday Ainsworth, one of the game’s most engaging managers, was looking ahead again. “Already the cogs are turning in my head thinking about what we need to do now to give a good account of ourselves in the Championship. We don’t want to waste all this hard work getting there for a one-season hit.”</p>
<p>He dwelled too on the significance of his second promotion in seven full seasons as manager – “that moment was up there with everything I’ve ever achieved in football” – and offered a reminder that his centre-forward’s new mate Klopp doesn’t have a trademark on football’s biggest grins.</p>
<p>“I got home at 6am, went into my 13-year-old son’s bedroom and put my medal around his neck. The smile on his face said it all.”

My favourite play is Henry V because of the scene that takes place on St. Crispen’s Eve before the Battle of Agincourt.</p>
<p>Every Christmas with Missy’s assistance, before the last guests leave our house, we gather everyone together and read Henry’s speech to his men. To me, it captures the fundamental spirit of people and the drive to obtain their aspirations no matter the odds.</p>
<p>I suppose it’s why I love trying cases, building businesses, and sports so much. Each involves being clear headed about the task and looking for the way to succeed no matter the odds.</p>
<p>I have a good friend who played college football at a high level in the United States. Unfortunately, his team was not very good. They lost virtually every game they played for three years. But I recall Ralph telling me that he always went into every game expecting to win. He knew it would take perfect effort but he thought it was possible.Now why do I mention these stories as we get ready for our game on Monday?Four reasons:First, when you enter a battle, it’s not decided until it’s over. Odds are just that, probabilities. You play the game because that’s the only way you can find out who wins. Everything else is speculation. Watching our club is a breath-taking experience. Skill, speed, teamwork working toward a common goal. They make me proud every time.Second, superior planning makes a difference. For all of Henry’s encouragement, if they had not brought the long bows, the French would have won. I don’t think I have met anyone who plans as well as Gareth. You can be confident he has thought through all the issues.Third, talent makes a difference. When Ralph’s team added additional talented players who had the philosophy he did, they became winners. Our team is very fortunate. After we stabilized the budget, we were able to retain and add players that give us a depth we have not had in a generation or more.We are fortunate that Gareth and our players are winners. They have the skills and work ethic that have produced our best League One season. They deserve everyone’s full throated support.All of which brings me to my fourth point:As Henry explained to his brave band of followers, those who were not with him that day would regret it forever. Just because we cannot be at Wembley, does not mean we cannot be with the boys. Many Wanderers throughout the world are proudly identifying themselves as Chairboys, planning watching parties, and offering their hopes up for a successful outcome.All who identify with the Club before the game will always be able to claim solidarity with the effort. All will be able to tell their children where they were and what they were doing when Wycombe had its greatest victory. Monday will be our day. Make your support known and take pride in saying Yeah, I’m a Wanderer.

Wycombe&rsquo;s 133-year wait for a place in the second tier of English football has come to an end.</p>
<p>The club will play in the Championship for the first time in their history next season.</p>
<p>They beat Oxford 2-1 in last night&rsquo;s League One play-off final at Wembley.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky Sports News, boss Gareth Ainsworth was full of admiration for his team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just amazing. We can&rsquo;t afford the best footballing players but we&rsquo;ve got players with heart and determination and that was a Wycombe performance. I&rsquo;m so, so proud of the boys. They just ground it out and I still just can&rsquo;t believe that we&rsquo;re a Championship club. &ldquo;I think Accrington and maybe Rochdale were down there with us as favourites to go down but we were right down there budget-wise. We had nine players turn up on that first day of pre-season and two of them were trialists. [The owners] Rob and Peter Couhig have come in and they&rsquo;ve just enabled me to fill the slots that I had.</p>
<p>I HAVE NO WORDS!!! 🏆 WE’VE ONLY WENT AND DONE IT!!! 💙💙💙 @wwfcofficial pic.twitter.com/sYcoZ4BavR — Jack Grimmer (@JackGrimmer) July 13, 2020</p>
<p>A year ago, @RCouhig and @petecouhig arrived at Adams Park with a dream.</p>
<p>It’s come true more quickly and in more incredible fashion than we could ever have imagined.</p>
<p>The Worldwide Wycombe Wanderers Phenomenon is alive and kicking! pic.twitter.com/PcGUfLvz87 — Wycombe Wanderers (@wwfcofficial) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is for all the fans who are watching at home. I know they were there and we said before the game that we could feel them out on that pitch. That&rsquo;s a good team Karl Robinson has got and now we&rsquo;ve beaten both Fleetwood and Oxford, so I think people might start respecting us a little bit more now. &ldquo;That win means this club is safe for a few years at least and I feel for so many clubs because COVID-19 has really hurt clubs and I know it&rsquo;s going to be tough for some clubs. But we weren&rsquo;t going to look this opportunity in the mouth, we were going to take it. All my staff have got everyone spot-on for the performances. &ldquo;Five years ago, we lost here on penalties but I didn&rsquo;t want lightning to strike twice. I don&rsquo;t even watch Joe Jacobson&rsquo;s penalties normally but I had to watch that one and I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s gone in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oxford will stay in League One for the 2020/21 season.
