Shannen Joyce (25) is the face of Daffodil Day 2020. Shannen has overcome Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma twice, having first been diagnosed aged 19 and again aged 24. Daffodil Day, supported by Boots Ireland, takes place on Friday March 27th.</p>
<p>The Irish Cancer Society is marking its first ever digital Daffodil Day today after cancelling all events due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Every year, Daffodil Day raises millions for the charity and is its biggest fundraiser.</p>
<p>However, all street collections and fundraising drives due to take place have been cancelled and the society is instead holding a digital Daffodil Day, where people can download a digital daffodil to show their support instead of purchasing a physical pin.</p>
<p>CEO Averil Power said that today people will take part in virtual events, such as venues streaming online fundraisers and solo walks.</p>
<p>“When we made the decision earlier this month to cancel all Daffodil Day events and street collections we were blown away by the response,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>“Across Ireland we have seen people take up safe ways to raise funds including things like solo walks or virtual events. Venues have even offered to stream events as online fundraisers. And we have had dozens of offers from companies offering to help in various ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said that it is important for the society to be able to operate even during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>“Each year more than 40,000 people are diagnosed with cancer – unfortunately this will remain the case even with the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>“What’s more is there are approximately 200,000 people in Ireland living with and beyond cancer, many of whom are at a higher risk of developing a serious illness if they catch coronavirus,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>This year, the society has shifted the focus of its Daffodil Day campaign to its night nurse service.</p>
<p>“The Irish Cancer Society is continuing to provide crucial services including our NightNurse service, providing end-of-life care for people in their homes, our volunteer driving service to transfer patients to chemotherapy and other support services,” said Ms Power.</p>
<p>She said that the society mostly relies on donations from the public to sustain itself.</p>
<p>“We’re determined to be there for everyone who needs us. But as only 3pc of our funding comes from the State, we can’t do that without the support of the public so please help by donating what you can on cancer.ie.”</p>

<h3 id="irish-cancer-society-to-fund-remote-counselling-for-people-who-cant-have-face-to-face-sessions-due-to-covid-19">Irish Cancer Society to fund remote counselling for people who can&rsquo;t have face-to-face sessions due to Covid-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/5054237/river/?height=400&amp;version=5054242" alt="img">
THE IRISH CANCER Society is to fund remote counselling during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The service is available to adults and children who are affected by cancer who cannot access counselling services due to the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The organisation is working with community cancer support centres to deliver this service, drawing on the skills of counsellors who provide this service in communities across the country.</p>
<p>Donal Buggy, Head of Services with the Irish Cancer Society, said counselling is “an important tool for all cancer patients and their loved ones as they live with and beyond cancer”.</p>
<p>“With many people now unable to access their usual counselling supports we have developed this new model to ensure people can get help as they need it,” he added.</p>
<p>Adults and children</p>
<p>The service is available to all people who have been diagnosed with cancer, as well as their carers and loved ones.</p>
<p>It is also available for children through a play-therapy model, and for teenagers using appropriately trained and vetted practitioners.</p>
<p>Anyone who feels they need counselling can contact the Cancer Nurseline on freephone 1800 200 700 or by emailing <a href="mailto:cancernurseline@irishcancer.ie">cancernurseline@irishcancer.ie</a>.</p>
<p>If the service is suitable for their needs, they will be linked in with an accredited, experienced counsellor.</p>
<p>The helpline’s hours have been extended to 9am to 8pm on Monday to Thursday and 9am to 5pm on Friday to Sunday.</p>
<p>“We understand that this is an especially worrying time for those affected by cancer and their families. Our Cancer Nurseline is also available to provide support, information and advice to people at this time,” Buggy said.
