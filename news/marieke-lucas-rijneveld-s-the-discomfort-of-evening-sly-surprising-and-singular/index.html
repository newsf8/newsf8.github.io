<p>The idea that words and wishes have a material impact on the world is something we try to disbelieve as adults. We try to become logical and to understand the proper structures of cause and effect, to work towards known outcomes in a rational way. But still, evidence abounds that we do not fully credit the reality of reasonableness. Whether it’s New-Age-adjacent crazes such as The Secret, which places its faith in “laws of attraction”, or just that old perennial, prayer, we can’t quite let go of the suspicion that our inner and outer expressions hold some power which is not explicable.</p>
<p>For children, of course, this belief is much more intuitive. Magical thinking causes a child to perceive, as Freud had it, that “it is raining because I am sad”. A child, who is in reality at the height of their own powerlessness, and who may even confront their own inefficacy with great frustration on a daily basis, simultaneously feels omnipotent.</p>
<p>This childish solipsism is one of the unsettling concepts explored with majestic dread by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld in The Discomfort of Evening. First published in 2018 in the Netherlands, where it caused a sensation, it has now been translated into English by Michele Hutchinson and is shortlisted for the International Booker Prize. Sly, surprising, gently chaotic, it’s the most singular and strident debut I’ve read in a long time.</p>
<p>Rijneveld, who uses the pronoun “they”, grew up on a farm in North Brabant, and still works once a week on a dairy farm. As a toddler, their elder brother was killed by a bus on the walk to school. In a recent interview in Dazed, they said “My father hasn’t read [the novel]. My mother has. I did have to tell them that they weren’t the parents in the novel. The most difficult thing was my brother. My parents never talked about their loss, so it was hard for them that their own child had started to talk about it.”</p>
<p>The Discomfort of Evening is narrated by Jas, a ten-year-old girl living on a farm in a religious family. Jas, fearing that her rabbit will be killed soon, wishes that her brother Matthies be taken instead. When he dies in a skating accident, Jas’s relationship to reality, and to her increasingly unstable family, begins to disintegrate and mutate. The anger of her father, the muddled despair of her unwell mother and the confusion of her siblings simmer disquietly. Jas begins to engage in a series of escalating, troubled rituals and experiments in an attempt to counter the terrible grief submerging herself and her surroundings.</p>
<p>Jas’s language is clean and plain, convincingly childlike, but strikingly poetic – even (or especially) when it is describing the mucky corporeality of rural life. The warts on a toad are like capers, the glands prone to ooze sour oil just like the edible green buds. The smells and excretions of the animals and the banal grotesquery of her interactions with them mount up to portray life as an unlovely thing. Matthies, in death, is pristine and beautiful, untouched even by conversation:</p>
<p>Suddenly I remember what the vet said when he fished my brother out of the water with Evertsen: “When people have hypothermia, you have to handle them like porcelain. The smallest touch could be deadly.” All this time we’ve been so careful with Matthies that we don’t even talk about him, so that he can’t break into pieces inside our heads.</p>
<p>It isn’t a pleasant book to read. Jas’s chronic constipation is relayed in repet- itive detail, the resultant probing and excavation mirrored later in her interference with one of the farm’s cows, as she penetrates the animal’s orifices with detached interest. Sex acts between children are drawn with queasy ambivalence, characterised both by innocence and a desire for revenge or penance. Though tender, the novel resists narrative redemption, but provides its own kind of consolation through artistry and originality.</p>
<p>The singularity of a child’s perception allows acts of imagination an adult can’t access. This is why we romanticise childhood as an experience of unique internal freedom, a sacred realm we long always to return to for the rest of our lives. Perhaps the greatest achievement of Rijneveld’s novel is to expose the underside of that precious quality.</p>
<p>Jas’s imagination helps her to create haphazard outlets in times of great distress. She tries to force two toads to breed, believing that if they achieve this intimacy then so too will her alienated parents. She imagines a Jewish family hidden beneath the floorboards as a way to explain her mother’s inability to nourish Jas and her siblings – she is simply busy with the hidden family, diverting her care to them instead of her own children. She tries to imagine her way out of devastation, but cannot transcend the demoralising, competing griefs that merge beneath one roof.</p>
<p>The magical thinking of this child produces a truly haunting and savage loneliness, communicated by Rijneveld with an agile intensity I have rarely encountered.</p>

<h3 id="book-review-the-discomfort-of-evening-by-marieke-lucas-rijneveld">&ldquo;Book review: The discomfort of evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/2/0/f/j/g/o/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.20c5oq.png/1590636844237.jpg" alt="img">
Even before the pandemic, attention was being lavished on novels to cheer us up. The biggest trend in fiction was for optimistic works such as Gail Honeyman&rsquo;s Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, books which speak of the power of resilience, of kindness and community, against the odds. But if &ldquo;uplit&rdquo; is, indeed, the new black, then it&rsquo;s safe to say that 29-year-old Marieke Lucas Rijneveld didn&rsquo;t get the memo. Even if they did (Rijneveld uses gender neutral pronouns), one suspects they wouldn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Rijneveld&rsquo;s shockingly disturbing debut, The Discomfort of Evening, shortlisted for this year&rsquo;s International Booker and already a bestseller in Holland, follows a 10-year-old called Jas, whose world collapses when an older sibling dies. Jas has a tough kind of life. She lives (as Rijneveld did) on a Dutch dairy farm, and family life is governed by a strict Christian ethos. Her father treats the children with the same rough affection as his livestock, and Jas spends much of December worried that he might cook her pet rabbit. Her mother&rsquo;s insistence on covering her children, &ldquo;one by one in udder ointment to protect us from the cold&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t win them friends in the playground. But these worries become trivial when, just before Christmas, Jas&rsquo;s brother, Matthies, enters a skating race, and drowns under thin ice.</p>

<p>Rijneveld&rsquo;s prose is filtered through Jas&rsquo;s watchful eyes, and the novel catches something of the catastrophic effects of childhood bereavement. Jas creeps downstairs late at night, to stare at the corpse, laid out &ldquo;on the dresser on a white crocheted cloth&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Although they said nice things about my brother, death still felt ugly and as indigestible as the lost tiger nut we found days after a birthday party behind a chair or under the TV cabinet. In the coffin, Matthies' face looked like it was made of beeswax, so smooth and tight. The nurses had stuck tissue paper under his eyelids to keep them shut, while I&rsquo;d have preferred them to be open so that we could look at each other one more time, so that I could be sure I didn&rsquo;t forget the colour of his eyes, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t forget me.</p>
<p>This sense of death as something &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; and &ldquo;indigestible&rdquo; becomes central to the book. In a convincing post-Freudian riff, the grief-stricken Jas negotiates her loss by hoarding. &ldquo;I can only hold on to a person or memory with the things I collect. I can safely stow them away in my coat pocket,&rdquo; she tells herself. She begins by refusing to take off her coat. Soon she refuses to evacuate her bowels.</p>
<p>The constipation makes for a different kind of reading suspense. It&rsquo;s hard not to feel vicariously agonised as Jas makes her way from school to home, becoming bulkier and more pained every day. And the invisibility of her pain is accompanied by the silence of childhood. &ldquo;Nobody knows my heart,&rdquo; she tells us.</p>
<p>She watches her mourning mother grow thinner and more distant: &ldquo;Her eyes have been deeper in their sockets lately too, like my old flat football is sinking further and further into the manure pit next to the cowshed.&rdquo; Jas stands &ldquo;close&rdquo;, longing for love, as her mother &ldquo;cooks eggs in the hope that she&rsquo;ll accidentally touch me when she moves the frying pan&hellip; Skin against skin, hunger against hunger.&rdquo; Scenes like this feel heartbreakingly tender, but the overwhelming effect of this book is brutal. Images rub up queasily against each other, in a kind of poetry of the grotesque. The description of a glass of milk from the family milk tank, &ldquo;lukewarm&rdquo; with &ldquo;a yellowish layer of cream&rdquo; jostles uneasily with scenes of siblings engaged in masturbatory games involving Coke cans and Sindy dolls. Videos shown in Jas&rsquo;s school history lessons summon fears that her mother is hiding &ldquo;Jews in the basement&rdquo;. There is pissing in the bath, and similes that churn the stomach: toads with &ldquo;warts&rdquo; that &ldquo;look just like capers&rdquo;, and an open mouth full of &ldquo;watery mashed potato dotted with bits of bean and some apple puree&rdquo; that &ldquo;looks like vomit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The book finishes with a wrenching twist, however this is not a novel driven by plot, but one of character and form. Its formal power is extraordinary – Rijneveld choreographs a baroque layering of horror that lands somewhere between late Hardy and Georges Bataille. The overall effect is ghastly, but not gratuitous.</p>
<p>There are no dates in the novel. Small clues place it around the turn of the millennium, but The Discomfort of Evening feels, without question, like a book that was written for today. In this age of the Anthropocene, as children find themselves commodified into conscience-salving beacons of hope, Rijneveld gives us something less digestible: a vision of a childhood both broken and hopeless –​ a parable to shake us from sentiment.</p>
<p>Whenever I finish a book, whether as a reviewer or a regular reader, I think about what kind of mark it will leave on me, and on others. How often will I recommend it to people I meet? How will it stay with me? To whom might I give it as a gift? The Discomfort of Evening eludes this pragmatic rule of thumb. I can&rsquo;t imagine giving it to anybody. Nobody would want to read this book. I think many of us need to.

<p>“Restlessness gives wings to the imagination”. Maurice Gilliams</p>
<p>Dutch author Marieke Lucas Rijneveld chose this epigraph to preface their debut novel, ‘The Discomfort of Evening’, long before Coronavirus demanded a state of restlessness worldwide. Now, the quotation takes on a hopeful and poignant quality, speaking to the many acts of creativity that have been borne from lock-down. But for Rijneveld and the other five authors shortlisted for this year’s International Booker Prize, this period has been rendered more febrile with the news that the announcement of the prize-winner will be postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>The International Booker prize awards £50,000 for the best novel translated into English, which is shared equally between author and translator. The winner was due to be announced on 19th May, following the announcement of the shortlist on 2nd April. Organisers made the decision to delay the award after publishers and booksellers emphasised the unprecedented difficulties posed by Covid-19 to the sales and distribution of the shortlisted novels. A new date has not been given for the announcement of the winner, but it is likely to take place later in the year.</p>
<p>Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s ‘The Discomfort of Evening’ stands out as the only debut novel on the shortlist. At 28 years-old, Rijneveld, who uses the pronouns they/them, is one of the youngest authors ever to be shortlisted for a Booker prize, beaten only by Daisy Johnson, who was just 27 when her novel ‘Everything Under’ was nominated for the Man Booker Prize in 2018. Rijneveld’s debut tells the story of an intensely religious Dutch dairy-farming family, whose lives are fractured after one of their sons dies in an ice-skating accident. The narrative premise holds a striking parallel with the author’s own life; Rijneveld’s older brother died after being hit by a bus when he was 12-years-old.</p>
<p>The novel is narrated through Jas, the middle child, and is quick to establish the unsettling mixture of childish innocence and profound psychological trauma that characterises the rest of the book. It opens with Jas feeling jealous of her older brother, Matthies, who sets off to go ice-skating with local children, somewhere too dangerous for the young Jas to join them. Simultaneously, Jas suspects that her father wants to serve her pet rabbit for Christmas dinner in a week’s time. Before bed that night, Jas adds a flippant prayer to her usual repertoire, asking for her rabbit’s life to be saved in place of Matthies’. The following morning, a doctor returns Matthies’ dead body to the family home.</p>
<p>Rijneveld’s simple and candid tone, translated into English by Michele Hutchison, masterfully captures the interiority of a child’s mind, particularly the freedom of imaginative association that comes with youth — the warts on a toad’s back are like the ‘capers’ found in the kitchen of Jas’s mother, for example. But the authenticity of this innocent narrative voice takes on an increasingly uncanny quality as it is forced to confront the family’s trauma. In one vivid moment, Jas recalls a schoolteacher recommending that students push drawing pins into a map of the world, choosing the places they’d most like to go; Jas desires to escape the distressing world she finds herself in by folding up inside herself and disappearing, so she decides to push a drawing pin into her own belly-button. The wound becomes progressively more infected as the novel continues, serving as a gruesome marker of the passing of time.</p>
<p>Tactility is a major concern of the novel, allowing Rijneveldt to showcase their notable talent for transposing sensory experience into language. This starts as something innocuous and child-like, such as Jas’ experience of holding the decorative Christmas angels that lie around the house, or the feeling of sticking her fingers into the soft cheese that her mother makes from the farm’s dairy cows. It soon acquires a more sinister quality after Matthies’ death; Jas touches her dead brother’s eyelids, sensing the tissue paper that the mortician put behind them to paste them shut. In more sensitive moments, Jas mourns the loss of physical affection from her parents; she positions herself in the way of her mother in the kitchen in the hope that her mother might accidentally brush past her — the children have not been hugged or touched by their parents since the death.</p>
<p>With their parents preoccupied by a potent mixture of extreme grief and religious guilt, each of the surviving children develop unsettling compulsions and obsessions. Jas refuses to take off her coat for months on end and starts to hoard a variety of objects in her pockets. Her older brother, Obbe, repeatedly bangs his head against the wall at night. These troubling behaviours are intensified by the backdrop of the family’s extreme evangelism — Matthies’ chair at the family dining table is kept untouched in its place as they anticipate his return at the Second Coming. Indeed, because the death occurs so early-on in the book, the reader finds herself questioning whether the children’s morbid behaviours were caused by this immediate trauma or were already established by their intensely stifling family dynamic. Death continues to follow the family even after the tragic accident; Obbe drowns his pet hamster in front of his sisters in a perturbed mirroring of their brother’s death, and the dairy-farm is blighted by foot-and-mouth disease (the book is set in the years after the millennium, when there were numerous outbreaks of the infection).</p>
<p>This is a disturbing and unsettling read that is certainly not for the faint-hearted, but its vivid and gruesome components are in no way gratuitous. There are elements that may sit too uncomfortably with some readers, particularly its treatment of Jas learning about the Holocaust at school through her childish mind, and other visceral depictions of bodily orifices being penetrated by fingers and farm tools (Jas’ father tries to treat her constipation in a rather violent way, and later there is some difficulty with a cow and an artificial insemination device). But Rijneveld possesses a singular talent for narrating the abrasive, distressing and unnerving elements of extreme trauma when experienced through young minds. Already a bestseller in the Netherlands, ‘The Discomfort of Evening’ is a confident and provocative debut that undoubtedly deserves its spot on the International Booker Prize shortlist, if not the top-prize itself.

<h3 id="the-discomfort-of-evening-by-marieke-lucas-rijneveld--review">&ldquo;The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld – review&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b9d5d07cfeced3e8a4435e1a9b0fa7b3f12a3e/98_0_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=dde1bdfa4300ccc2d956c8bb9fc5f0c2" alt="img">
Discomfort is putting it mildly. Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s debut novel, which has been longlisted for the International Booker prize, goes all the way to disturbing. A bestseller in the 28-year-old’s native Netherlands, the book begins with a 10-year-old girl, Jas, feeling angry at not being allowed to go ice-skating with her brother Matthies and wishing he would die instead of her rabbit (she fears her unsentimental dairy-farming father has his eye on the pet for dinner).</p>
<p>And then her brother does die, falling through the ice.</p>
<p>What follows is an unflinching study of a family falling apart in the madness of grief, rendered all the more unnerving for the childishly plain, undramatic way their compulsive behaviours are reported. They are further tested by the arrival of foot-and-mouth disease on the farm (the book is set around the 2001 outbreak), necessitating the slaughter of their beloved cows.</p>
<p>Jas’s family are strict Christians – a background shared with Rijneveld, who still works on a dairy farm. The non-binary author has talked about growing up with a sense of a “threatening, cruel God” – and also losing a brother at a young age, which the family barely discussed. Suffering in silence is the fictionalised family’s response too. “We only knew about the harvest that came from the land, not about the things that grew inside ourselves,” Jas says.</p>
<p>Even before Matthies’s death, the parents are pious to the point of punitive; bodily functions are a source of shame. Afterwards, it’s as if teachings about sin, penance and the corporeal become painfully snarled up with the family’s loss, and their desperate attempts to control or master it.</p>
<p>Jas refuses to take off her increasingly disgusting red coat, keeps a drawing pin stuck in her belly button and develops chronic constipation (this matter-of-fact scatological novel is not for the squeamish). Her brother, Obbe, obsessively bashes his head on his bedframe and starts killing animals, while her mother refuses to eat an ever-growing list of certain foods.</p>
<p>Rijneveld pokes sticky fingers into nasty places to stir up uneasy prepubescent memories</p>
<p>Throughout The Discomfort of Evening characters test the limits of bodily boundaries – their own, and others. Jas’s father shoves soap up her bum to make her poo; her sister sticks her tongue in Jas’s mouth, like “a leftover steak that Mum’s warmed up in the microwave”. There’s a particularly unpleasant scene featuring a metal artificial insemination gun going into a hole it was never intended for.</p>
<p>Rijneveld really doesn’t hold back with all this, poking sticky fingers into nasty places to stir up uneasy memories of prepubescent explorations of sexuality and mortality. The novel evokes a general curiosity and bewilderment with the adult world, here given two supercharged shots in the backside by the unspeakable (in all senses) tragedy of the brother’s death and the pressure of extreme religious beliefs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My family are too frightened to read my book&rsquo;: meet Europe&rsquo;s most exciting authors Read more</p>
<p>Translated by Michele Hutchison, Rijneveld’s writing is raw and impassive, though often grotesquely vivid in its descriptions. Skinned knuckles look like “ruptured prawns’ heads”; bits of wet crisp at the swimming pool “stick to your feet like blisters”. Jas has a singular imagination, too: she pictures her dead granny’s face “beginning to ooze eggnog as thin as yolk” out of eye sockets and pores.</p>
<p>Not everything works: Rijneveld seems to strain in search of an ending. Jas’s conviction that her mum is hiding Jews in the basement seems less plausible than most of her delusions and rather underdeveloped. (Apparently, the Dutch version also contained a joke deemed too offensive for British publication – removing it seems a strange choice, serving only to inflame an imagination already given a good stoking by Rijneveld.)</p>
<p>But this is a pretty remarkable debut. Confident in its brutality, yet contained rather than gratuitous, it introduces readers to both a memorably off-key narrator and a notable new talent.</p>

<p>There is a specific type of novel that I know I could never get my mother to read. For example, in lieu of a Sacred Heart above my kitchen door I have a glossy headshot of Ottessa Moshfegh – framed and lit by a small red bulb. In times of great stress, I pray to Her for guidance. But goodness knows I could never successfully convince my mother to read My Year of Rest and Relaxation. So, when I began reading Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s debut novel, The Discomfort of Evening, and came across the line: “I watched as the diarrhoea splattered on to the grass like the caramel sauce my granny poured on to the rice pudding”, I knew I had a tough sell on my hands.</p>
<p>Rijneveld relishes in these abject similes which they use to convey the disturbed mind of their narrator Jas, a young girl living on a rural farm in the Netherlands with her devoutly religious family. The novel begins with the death of Matthies, her older brother, after he falls through a frozen lake. Unable to understand or deal with her own grief, Jas begins to experience deeply horrifying thoughts and fantasies that warp and distort her reality.</p>
<p>A runaway bestseller on its release in Dutch in 2018 and now one of the 13 novels longlisted for the International Booker, the novel made a superstar of Rijneveld (28) in their native Netherlands. The book was even big enough to warrant the middle-aged male writer Gerbrand Bakker to pen a deeply intellectual think piece in the national Dutch newspaper Trouw about how the novel is bad, actually. Thankfully the opinions of ageing male novelists rarely matter.</p>
<p>The Discomfort of Evening works best when it acts as a study on the manifestations of grief. Early on Jas discovers that in order to prevent post-mortem evacuations, cotton wool has been used to plug her dead brother’s anus. Shortly after this, Jas herself becomes severely constipated, as if she were trying to mimic her brother’s corpse. Her constipation, whether self-inflicted or not, is the most painful and physical manifestation of her grief and leads to one of the novel’s most jarring scenes as her father spreads her cheeks and shoves chunks of green soap into her rectum as an apparent tried and tested form of constipation relief.</p>
<p>Fantasies</p>
<p>As time amasses after her brother’s death, her fantasies become pitch black as we, the reader, begin to struggle to decipher if what we are reading is reality or nightmare.</p>
<p>When the infamous 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease arrives on the family farm it only further fuels the Hieronymus Bosch-like imagery that plagues her mind. In many aspects, Jas finds her closest comparison in Benny, the disturbed child protagonist of Michael Haneke’s 1992 film Benny’s Video. Both are works which require a certain level of willpower from their audiences as their protagonists fantasise about the brutal misuses of farm machinery.</p>
<p>Yet while the novel succeeds as an unsettling exploration of a family dealing with a sudden death, as the novel progresses it tends to lose its narrative thread and becomes unintentionally episodic. Some could argue that Rijneveld’s decision to tell the story as if we are in the mind of a disturbed young girl pardons this lack of cohesiveness, but often the novel reads like Rijneveld is more interested in creating more and more disturbing fantasies instead of actually focusing on what makes this novel interesting. But overall, this isn’t enough of a complaint to deem the novel unsuccessful.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t come as surprising that a novel like The Discomfort of Evening has appeared at this specific moment in literature. Recently there has been a trend for novels and stories that focus on, to put it plainly, grotesque characters written about grotesquely. Perhaps the urtext of this trend is Moshfegh’s Eileen, the story of a woman who stores her own piss in jars who we somehow end up loving. Another work is Kristen Roupenian’s insanely viral short story Cat Person which describes, in stomach-churning prose, a hook-up from hell. I feel The Discomfort of Evening sits proudly among this subgenre, a sort of abject fiction, all being produced by a group of young writers who, when they mention to the Good Book, are actually referring to Powers of Horror by Julia Kristeva.</p>
<p>Despite some issues, The Discomfort of Evening is a strong debut. Rijneveld’s poetic prose, eloquently translated by Michele Hutchison, clashes and rattles against the horrors it describes, a constant fight between terror and beauty. It is a novel that does its best to make sure you won’t forget it anytime soon. Something I know my mother will absolutely never read.
