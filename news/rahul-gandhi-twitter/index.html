Rahul Gandhi slams Modi government over handling of Coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a swipe at the Modi government over its lockdown decision in wake of the coronavirus crisis. Rahul used a quote of world-renowned physicist Albert Einstein to target the government. Taking to Twitter, Rahul said that arrogance of the government is to be blamed for the current crisis.</p>
<p>The Congress leader also shared a graph that showed how the four successive lockdowns flattened the curve of the economy, instead of Coronavirus-related deaths, which are rising in the country.</p>
<p>Accusing the government of arrogance and not listening to the voice of the opposition, he wrote on his Twitter page: “This lock down proves that: The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance.”</p>
<p>Rahul and his party have been critical of the Modi government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. Rahul has time and again questioned the decision to impose lockdowns in the country which he has claimed as complete failures as they have not yielded the desired results.</p>
<p>This lock down proves that: “The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance.”</p>

<p>Last week, Rahul had said that the country under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on it’s way to winning the wrong race, adding that “it was a result of a lethal blend of ‘arrogance and incompetence’ of the government”. He made this comment referring to the rising COVID-19 cases in the country.</p>
<p>Rahul has also held the Modi government responsible for the downfall in the economy and has been demanding cash be transferred in the hands of people who are facing the brunt of lockdown.</p>
<p>India has gone past the United Kingdom in terms of coronavirus cases to become the fourth worst-hit country in the world after the United States, Brazil and Russia. According to the Health ministry data, the country saw a jump of over 11,000 coronavirus cases for the third consecutive day on Monday, taking the total number of infections to over 3.32 lakh, while the toll rose to 9,520 with 325 more deaths.

<p>Rahul Gandhi has targeted the government on Twitter once again over the rising number of Covid-19 cases in successive lockdowns. He tweeted “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” He even shared a graph which pointed at the rising number of cases.

Rahul Gandhi has been asking the government repeatedly to clarify on China.</p>
<p>Highlights Rahul Gandhi tweeted this morning on the Chinese aggression in Ladakh</p>
<p>In his tweet, the Congress leader also targeted PM Modi</p>
<p>Hours later, Ravi Shankar Prasad delivered a withering response</p>
<p>Hours after Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being &ldquo;absolutely silent&rdquo; while the Chinese &ldquo;have taken our territory&rdquo;, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad delivered a withering response. The Congress leader should not ask questions on international matters on Twitter, said the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rahul Gandhi should know that on international matters, like China, questions should not be asked on Twitter. He is the same man who asked for evidence after Balakot airstrikes and 2016 Uri attack,&rdquo; Ravi Shankar Prasad was quoted as telling news agency ANI.</p>
<p>Mr Gandhi had tweeted in the morning on the Chinese aggression in Ladakh and targeted the PM.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chinese have walked in and taken our territory in Ladakh. Meanwhile. The PM is absolutely silent and has vanished from the scene,&rdquo; the Congress MP posted, tagging a news article that claimed China has taken a hard line during military-level talks on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mr Gandhi has been asking the government repeatedly to clarify whether China has taken over Indian Territory in Ladakh region.</p>
<p>Reports of Chinese incursion emerged as tension between India, China peaked in early May after skirmishes between soldiers in the Pangong Lake region.</p>
<p>In a meeting between top military officers on Saturday, India and China agreed to &ldquo;peacefully resolve the situation in the border areas in accordance with various bilateral agreements&rdquo;, the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, government sources said Indian and Chinese troops have begun mutual disengagement in some parts of eastern Ladakh.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;significant&rdquo; number of Chinese troops have withdrawn, say government sources. To reciprocate, the Indian side also brought back some of its troops and vehicles from these areas, said top sources.</p>
<p>Sources quoted by news agency ANI say the government is clear, however, that tension on the borders will be done away with completely only when there is significant reduction of troops and equipment by China at the Line of Actual Control.</p>

On Sunday, Twitter was flooded with tweets under the hashtag ‘#मोदी_ही_पप्पू_है‘. In 2018, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had admitted in Parliament that he may be ‘Pappu’ but he is ‘Congress’ as the House erupted with laughter with this confession.</p>
<p>Rahul Gandhi has often been referred to as ‘Pappu’ for not being too smart. Considering this, one would think that it was Aam Aadmi Party supporters trending the hashtag just to distract themselves from the mess Delhi is in with respect to coronavirus. But when one clicked on the hashtag, one saw it was Congress supporters who were taking pride in showing how their ‘Pappu’ is not smart. One really can’t make this all up.</p>
<p>Congress supporters kept themselves busy posting memes mocking PM Modi, calling him a ‘Pappu’.</p>

<p>Congress supporters tweeted the video of slip of tongue by PM Modi while addressing US President Trump under the hashtag, conveniently forgetting the antics of their own ‘Pappu’.</p>
<p>This is a bit too rich and ironical coming from a Congress supporter.</p>

<p>Umm. Says the one trending ‘#मोदी_ही_पप्पू_है’ to mock PM Modi while their own party leader is nicknamed Pappu. This is just unreal.One can’t even figure out if this is a question or a statement.

<p>Updated: Jun 16, 2020 00:46 IST</p>
<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has hit out at the Centre over the rising fuel prices, which were hiked for the ninth straight day on Monday.</p>
<p>“Middle class, poor pay for gifts crony capitalists get,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Middle class and the poor pay for the gifts the crony capitalists get. #शर्म_करो_लुटेरी_सरकार pic.twitter.com/q69cqlF83Q — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Oil companies raised petrol price by 48 paise per litre and diesel by 23 paise per litre on Monday morning. In nine hikes since June 7, cumulatively petrol prices have gone up by Rs 5 per litre and diesel by Rs 4.87 a litre, according to PTI.</p>
<p>In Delhi, petrol will now cost Rs 76.26 per litre and diesel Rs 74.26 a litre after the hike.</p>
<p>Rates have been increased across the country and vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.</p>
<p>In the tweet, Rahul Gandhi also used a graph to show that fuel prices were low in May 2014 when the Congress-led UPA was in power despite high crude cost globally, but the NDA government raised the excise duty on petrol by 258.47 per cent and on diesel by 819.94 per cent as on June 15, 2020.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, the Congress leader posted another tweet as he continued his attack on the Modi government, this time over the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. He used the famous scientist Albert Einstein’s quote to criticise the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“This lock down proves that: “The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance.” Albert Einstein,” Gandhi said on Twitter.

Rahul Gandhi said that the lockdown announced by Modi government has failed to deliver the desired result. (File pic)</p>
<p>Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has stepped up his attack on the Modi government over the handling of Coronavirus situation in the country. Rahul took to Twitter to share India’s disease graph and compared it to other countries to criticise the government.</p>
<p>He said the lockdown announced by the BJP government has failed to deliver the desired result. Questioning the lockdown strategy to counter COVID-19, he said, “This is what a failed lockdown looks like.”</p>
<p>Rahul’s tweet included graphs of Spain, Germany, Italy and the UK, which had shown a decline in cases after the lockdowns. The graph of India, on the other hand, shows a spike in cases after the lockdowns.</p>
<p>The Congress leader had earlier said that lockdown in India has failed as the decision didn’t help contain the spread of the virus and that India is the only country in the world to have relaxed the lockdown when cases are rising.</p>

<p>According to the Union Health Ministry data, India on Friday saw a record single-day spike of 9,851 cases and 273 deaths, taking the tally to 2,26,770 and the death toll to 6,348.</p>
<p>India is now the seventh nation to be worst hit by the deadly virus in the world after the US, Brazil, Russia, the UK, Spain and Italy.
