Police trying to establish cause of death of girl group Kara’s former member</p>
<p>This article is more than 6 months old</p>
<p>This article is more than 6 months old</p>
<p>The K-pop singer Goo Hara has been found dead at her home in Seoul, according to police.</p>
<p>The body of the 28-year-old, a former member of the girl group Kara, was found early on Sunday evening, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported. Police said they were trying to establish the cause of death.</p>
<p>Goo’s death comes six months after her manager found her unconscious at her home, in what local media described as an apparent suicide attempt. The singer and actor later apologised to fans and recently relaunched her solo career with a tour of Japan and the release of a new single.</p>
<p>Last year, Goo took her former boyfriend to court after he threatened to release footage of them having sex that was filmed without her knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>Molka – in which women are covertly filmed and the footage uploaded to websites – has reached epidemic levels in South Korea, prompting calls for the government to take tougher action against offenders, who are almost always men.</p>
<p>In 2017, a reported 6,400 cases of illegal filming were reported to police, up from 2,400 in 2012.</p>
<p>Early last month, South Korean media reported that a woman had killed herself after she discovered that she had been secretly filmed in a hospital changing room.</p>
<p>Goo’s death comes weeks after the death of her close friend and fellow K-pop star Sulli turned the spotlight on the darkest corners of the K-pop industry and the online abuse directed at celebrities by “toxic” fans.</p>
<p>Sulli, a former member of the group f(x), had spoken publicly about her mental health problems and shock at her death sparked calls for greater support for performers.</p>
<p>A number of South Korean celebrities have killed themselves in the last decade. They include Jang Ja-yeon, a popular soap star who died in 2009, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse by powerful men.</p>
<p>The K-pop star Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself in December 2017.</p>
<p>Other artists have called for a change in the anonymous commenting culture on the internet, including Kwon Ji-an, a singer and painter better known by her stage name Solbi, who was subjected to cyber-insults in 2009 while she was a member of K-pop group Typhoon. She had also been wrongly identified in a sex video that was widely shared online.

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NCT-127-Johnny.jpg" alt="img">
Across the world, people are taking part in the Black Lives Matter movement through protests, donations, and social media campaigns. Over the past few days, several Korean artists including NCT 127’s Johnny, Yeri of Red Velvet, and Eric Nam have publicly shown their support for the movement. K-pop fans have also redirected their organized fan efforts to support Black Lives Matter in various ways.</p>

<p>Jae of Day6 and Got7’s Mark donated to the cause</p>
<p>Protests broke out in the U.S. after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in Minnesota on May 25. All four police officers involved in Floyd’s death were fired, and one officer was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p>
<p>Celebrities including John Boyega, Taylor Swift, Halsey, Ariana Grande, J. Cole, Lauren Jauregui, and Chrissy Teigen have all either spoken out in support of Black Lives Matter, donated to the movement, or participated in protests with activists.</p>
<p>Day6 is a South Korean rock band under JYP Entertainment, one of the largest entertainment companies in South Korea. Jae is a vocalist and electric guitarist in the group, and on May 31, he posted that he donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. He also shared a link encouraging his followers to support the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>Got7 is a K-pop group that also belongs with JYP Entertainment. On May 31, Mark Tuan, a member of the group, posted on his personal Twitter page encouraging fans to take part in the movement. Tuan also shared that he donated $7,000 to the George Floyd Memorial Fund.</p>
<p>“Stay stong, stay safe,” he tweeted to his 5.4 million followers.</p>
<p>K-pop idols Yeri and Johnny of SM Entertainment supported Black Lives Matter on social media</p>
<p>SM Entertainment is the largest entertainment company in South Korea, and it represents famed K-pop groups TVXQ!, Super Junior, Girls’ Generation, Shinee, f(x), Exo, Red Velvet, NCT, and SuperM. So far, two K-pop idols from SM Entertainment have spoken out in support of Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>Yeri of Red Velvet shared a photo of the movement on her Instagram story. NCT 127’s Johnny shared a black square on his personal Instagram page along with a brief message.</p>
<p>“Please let everyone be safe. I see you, I care for you. #blacklivesmatter,” he captioned the post.</p>

<p>Nam is a singer-songwriter who was born in Atlanta. He moved to South Korea from the U.S. to pursue a music career, and in 2019 he released his first English-language album Before We Begin.</p>
<p>On May 28, the singer-songwriter posted a statement about Black Lives Matter on Twitter.</p>
<p>“It does not matter what color your skin is, this affects you. RACISM IS NOT DEAD. George and Ahmaud are just two of the countless number of black men and women who have lost their lives senselessly. sign the petitions, raise your voice, and do what you can. #BlackLivesMatter,” Nam tweeted.</p>

<p>K-pop fans are supporting Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>K-pop fans are known for their strong social media presence, and over the past week fans of different artists have come together with a common goal. Fans have encouraged the artists they follow to use their platform to speak out, and they have used their social media accounts to help support the movement.</p>
<p>In a tweet on May 31, the Dallas Police Department asked people to submit videos “of illegal activity” from Black Lives Matter protests to the iWatch Dallas app. K-pop fans instead spammed the app with fancams of their favorite K-pop artists, which resulted in the app being temporarily unavailable. Buzzfeed News also reported that multiple people left one-star reviews for the app in the Google Play Store and iOS App Store.

<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62727274db19209f854cc7bd86f5a6b32ccfbaf/0_317_1590_954/master/1590.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=64fcbbd2c0c1a0e8eec306acd2610a66" alt="img">
South Korean pop star and actor Cha In Ha has been found dead at the age of 27, the third young Korean star to die in the space of two months.</p>
<p>Cha, who was a member of the K-pop group Surprise U and also had a fledgling acting career, was found at his home. His South Korean talent agency Fantagio saying it was “filled with grief at this news that is still hard to believe”.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said: “We earnestly ask for rumours not to be spread, and for speculative reports not to be released in order for his family – who are experiencing great sadness due to the sudden news – to be able to send him away peacefully.”</p>
<p>Cha (real name Lee Jae-ho) had recently started an acting career, starring in 2017 short film You, Deep Inside of Me and the TV drama Love With Flaws. Cha’s is the third sudden death of a K-pop star in recent months.</p>
<p>In November K-pop singer Goo Hara was found dead at her home, a few weeks after the death of her close friend and fellow singer Sulli. The deaths of both women drew attention to “toxic” fan culture in Korean, as both artists were subjected to online abuse.</p>
<p>Sulli had been one of the few K-pop stars to speak openly about her mental health problems and her death drew calls for greater emotional support for performers. The deaths also highlighted the problem of Molka, a practice in which women are covertly filmed so that footage can be uploaded to the web.</p>
<p>In 2018, Goo took her ex-boyfriend to court after he threatened to release explicit footage of them which was filmed without her consent. In 2017, 6,400 cases of illegal filming were reported to police, with the figure more than doubling since 2012 when 2,400 cases were recorded. During the trial Goo was subjected to a online abuse and lurid tabloid stories, with experts putting the negative attention down to South Korea’s patriarchal society.</p>
<p>The deaths have shone a light on the pressures that K-pop stars are under. Earlier this year the hugely successful K-pop boy band BTS began a month-long hiatus, with their management saying the break would allow themselves to “enjoy their normal lives as normal twentysomething young men”.</p>
<p>The band – which is worth $3.5bn annually to South Korea’s economy, according to the Hyundai Research Institute – said they would have “extended period of rest and relaxation” to “recharge and refresh as musicians and creators”.

<p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The death of South Korean singer and actress Goo Hara, whose body was found at her home in Seoul this week, has again shone a spotlight on pressures that stars, especially females, face in the cutthroat K-pop industry and in deeply conservative South Korean society.</p>
<p>Full Coverage: Music</p>
<p>Goo’s death at age 28 came less than two months after the death of Choi Jin-ri, or Sulli, another K-pop star and Goo’s close friend. Experts say both Goo and Choi faced extensive cyberbullying and sexual harassment from the public and media throughout their careers, which took a toll on their mental health.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>Police say they are still investigating Goo’s death and found a “pessimistic note” at her home.</p>
<p>Once popular mostly in Asia, K-pop has spread far beyond South Korea, thanks to wildly popular groups such as “BTS” and “Blackpink.”</p>
<p>Goo debuted in 2008 as part of the five-member girl group Kara, which shot almost immediately to fame and helped pioneer the K-pop global phenomenon.</p>
<p>She later launched a successful solo career in South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>Sulli began her career around the same time as Goo, debuting as a member of the girl band f(x) in 2009. She also had multiple acting roles after stepping away from her singing career.</p>
<p>Goo made headlines when she took her former boyfriend, Choi Jong-bum, to court last year. Choi claimed to have been assaulted by her, while Goo accused him of threatening to release a sex video of her.</p>
<p>During the dispute, Goo’s Korean agency didn’t renew her contract. A court sentenced Choi to 1 ½ years in prison on charges of coercion and assaulting and blackmailing Goo. The jail term was suspended, keeping him out of prison. Choi appealed and the trial is still ongoing.</p>
<p>K-pop is highly competitive, with dozens of groups debuting each year. Industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden industry. Aspiring artists, as young as their early teens, train for years. Only a few debut and even fewer are commercially successful. The likelihood of their success increases if they sign with a handful of top entertainment agencies.</p>
<p>The industry is known to have strict rules for their stars — including dating bans, spartan training and diets, and sometimes slave-like and unfair contracts. Experts say the industry has additional requirements for its female artists, unspoken rules reflective of South Korea’s patriarchal society.</p>
<p>Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist and writer of “Interviews with K-pop Stars,” said female stars are bound by rigid societal rules of femininity.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>“Some female idol members have gotten ostracized for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated patriarchal South Korean society,” Park told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Expectations of purity and chastity govern women in South Korea. Goo faced a barrage of hate comments following media reports about the sex video despite her being the victim of revenge porn.</p>
<p>“The topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,” said Tae-Sung Yeum, attending psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest Psychiatric Clinic. “There’s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.”</p>
<p>Sulli, Goo’s long-time friend, also made headlines, often malicious and misogynistic, for speaking out about subjects such as ageism and feminism. She was criticized for wearing shirts without a bra, calling older male colleagues by their first names and openly supporting feminism.</p>
<p>Yeum said it’s difficult for K-pop stars to seek professional help for depression, especially in a country where many people believe that psychiatric disorders can be “treated with one’s will.” He said multiple suicides in the industry stem from stars being plunged into a hypercompetitive system with a plethora of abuses from a young age.</p>
<p>When Sulli was found dead in her Seongnam home, Goo bid farewell to her friend in a live-streamed video. “I will live more diligently for you,” Goo cried while apologizing for not being able to make it to her funeral.</p>
<p>Two days before Goo’s death, she uploaded a final selfie on her Instagram with the caption, “Good night.”

<h3 id="k-pop-under-scrutiny-over-toxic-fandom-after-death-of-sulli">&ldquo;K-pop under scrutiny over &lsquo;toxic fandom&rsquo; after death of Sulli&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496dcf75663939b1b3e744fc62f83956cc006624/0_92_2666_1600/master/2666.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=01002a6b8f919dd489eb6beac2d6db84" alt="img">
The death this week of the South Korean singer and actor Sulli has turned the spotlight on the darkest corners of the highly pressurised K-pop industry and sparked anger over the failure of management agencies to protect their stars from the menace of “toxic fandom”.</p>
<p>Sulli, a former member of the group f(x), had spoken publicly about her mental health problems and shock at her death has led to calls for greater support for performers. Authorities said she was suffering from severe depression and are investigating suicide as a possible cause of death.</p>
<p>Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was one of a growing number of female South Korean singers and actors to have been targeted by online vitriol, often from anonymous male fans enraged by their idols’ refusal to conform to social norms.</p>
<p>Her “crimes” had included live-streaming a drinking session with friends and her decision not to wear a bra in public. She also revealed that she was in a relationship at the zenith of her singing career, defying the industry’s carefully crafted image of young female stars as sexually desirable but inexperienced.</p>
<p>She smashed other taboos, too, hosting a TV series about how online abuse had contributed to her anxiety disorder and social phobia, in a country with a strong cultural resistance to discussing mental illness.</p>
<p>“She expressed her views about what was intrinsically wrong in our society about how female stars are supposed to behave,” said Prof Yunkim Ji-yeong, an expert on Korean gender issues at the Institute of Body and Culture at Konkuk University in Seoul.</p>
<p>The messages of sympathy that flooded the internet after news of Sulli’s death emerged on Monday also criticised the culture of South Korea’s intensely competitive entertainment industry and the toll it takes on young performers.</p>
<p>Promising stars are put through a gruelling training schedule as they pass along the conveyor-belt production of new girl- and boybands. Young stars are subjected to strict controls over their private lives, including bans on dating, restrictions on mobile phone use and an expectation that they will sacrifice their health to achieve the desired image.</p>
<p>“I think a day where [people] would be ashamed of the K-showbusiness will surely come,” one user wrote. “I think an industry that makes money by [making people] sing, dance, undergo plastic surgeries and go on a diet to please the gaze of others since they are teenagers should really go bankrupt.”</p>
<p>Sulli was 11 when she began her career as an actor, before making her K-pop debut in 2009 for f(x), who quickly became one of the country’s most popular girl bands.</p>
<p>“Many celebrities who debuted at young ages suffer from depression and anxiety as they have to live in the public eye. They can be vulnerable if they get too much attention,” Park Jong-seok, the head doctor at Yonsei Bom psychiatric clinic in Seoul, told the Korea Times. “They go through adolescence without experiencing genuine friendships and stability with peer groups.”</p>
<p>A number of entertainment stars have killed themselves in the last decade. Jang Ja-yeon, a popular soap star, took his own life in 2009, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse and exploitation by influential politicians, business and newspaper executives and industry figures.</p>
<p>The K-pop star Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself in December 2017; the singer and actor Goo Hara, once part of the girl band Kara, apologised to fans after being found unconscious at her home earlier this year.</p>
<p>Kwon Ji-an, a singer and painter better known by her stage name Solbi, was subjected to cyber-insults in 2009 while a member of the K-pop group Typhoon, after being wrongly identified in a sex video that was widely shared online.</p>
<p>Sulli’s death has intensified demands for government action against bullying on popular internet portals where users are able to comment anonymously.</p>
<p>The website of the office of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was flooded with demands this week that users be required to register their real names before commenting. The national assembly will reportedly begin debating a bill, already dubbed “Sulli’s law”, later this year.</p>
<p>South Korean politicians have previously shown a willingness to tackle other forms of abuse with the enactment this year of a law against workplace bullying – known as gapjil – with persistent offenders facing a prison sentence of up to three years or a maximum fine of $25,000.</p>
<p>The public’s appetite for action against those who torment celebrities online is also growing. A poll this week by Realmeter showed support for new legislation at almost 70%.</p>
<p>“Freedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else’s dignity is beyond that limit,” said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. “There need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law.”

<h3 id="deaths-of-goo-hara-and-sulli-highlight-tremendous-pressures-of-k-pop-stardom">&ldquo;Deaths of Goo Hara and Sulli highlight tremendous pressures of K-pop stardom&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/kpop_suicide_main_191129_hpMain_20191129-230417_16x9_992.jpg" alt="img">
Deaths of Goo Hara and Sulli highlight tremendous pressures of K-pop stardom Goo Hara is the second notable K-pop star to die by suicide in a month.</p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea &ndash; Following the recent deaths of beloved K-pop stars Sulli and Goo Hara, experts and authorities in South Korea are examining what may have contributed to their deaths &ndash; and how to prevent similar tragedies.</p>
<p>Sulli took her own life about six weeks ago, and Goo was found dead in her apartment on Nov. 24, along with a handwritten memo and &ldquo;no evidence of murder,&rdquo; local police said.</p>
<p>The deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara likely aren&rsquo;t just the result of the entertainment industry&rsquo;s &ldquo;dark side,&rdquo; analysts said, as South Korea already suffers the highest rate of suicide among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a collection of developed nations.</p>
<p>There were 13,670 suicides in South Korea last year, an average of more than 37 per day, according to Statistics Korea, a part of the country&rsquo;s ministry of strategy and finance that generates and analyzes data. Among those aged 10 to 39, suicide was the leading cause of death, according to the agency.</p>
<p>For comparison, according to OECD data from 2017, per 100,000 persons, 24.6 in South Korea died by suicide compared with 13.9 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Experts have said that&rsquo;s due to a combination of complex social, cultural and personal issues.</p>
<p>Before the death of Goo, 28, a K-pop singer and former member of girl group Kara, there were warning signs, experts told ABC News.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her case was a red flag. She had attempted suicide before. That meant she could try again anytime,&rdquo; said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University.</p>

<p>Shortly after the death last month of Sulli, Goo&rsquo;s close friend, Goo bid farewell in an Instagram livestream video, saying, with tears running down her cheeks, &ldquo;I hope you will live happily as you please up there. I&rsquo;ll live more diligently for you. I&rsquo;ll work harder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;High risk&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was definitely categorized &lsquo;high risk,&rsquo; in need of treatment,&rdquo; Lee added. &ldquo;Goo should not have been left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contributing to high suicide rates in South Korea is a social taboo against treating depression as an illness, analysts told ABC News.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of antidepressants is the lowest in the world. Here, there is a tendency to regard getting medical help as embarrassing and only for &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; people,&rdquo; said Lee Je-wook, a psychiatrist at Bright Future Neuropsychiatric Clinic.</p>
<p>Lee added: &ldquo;Although perceptions against medical treatments are improving, it is still tough for celebrities to seek help for depression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major entertainment groups like SM Entertainment and JYP Entertainment run programs for their artists and regularly monitor &ldquo;risk groups,&rdquo; but the majority of artists don&rsquo;t have such luxuries, which can be expensive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A devastating effect&rsquo;</p>
<p>Authorities also must be concerned with copycat suicides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the case of last year, we presumed Werther Effect kicked in during January, March and July, after suicides of famous public figures,&rdquo; Kim Jin, who&rsquo;s in charge of population movement at government-run Statistics Korea, told the Hankyoreh newspaper.</p>
<p>South Korean media last year extensively covered the suicides of K-pop star and SHINee member Jonghyun, of longtime actor Jo Min-ki, who had been accused of sexual assault, and a well-respected politician named Roh Hoe-chan, who had been facing corruption charges.</p>
<p>Jonghyun was found dead Dec. 18, 2017, Jo was found dead on March 9, 2018, and Roh was found dead July 23, 2018.</p>
<p>Their deaths were covered in shocking detail, including graphic reports on their chosen method of suicide and the private notes they left for family members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many depressed young people, a loss of a famous role model like an idol star or movie star could have a devastating effect,&rdquo; Oh Kang Seob, chairman of Korea Association for Suicide Prevention, told ABC News.</p>
<p>The connection between pop idols and fans are especially strong and intimate in South Korea, where social media interactions have flourished. As of January, about 85% of South Koreans used some form of social media, ahead of 70% of Americans and about two-thirds of Canadians or residents of the U.K., according to DataReportal, a digital research firm.</p>
<p>Idols are expected to actively engage with fans through social networks like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, while fans reciprocate with likes and personal comments. Such strong interdependent online communications have powered the rise of viewer-driven, television-audition programs and the rise of K-pop groups including the boy-band BTS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A smart mobile environment has made fans consider themselves more of a companion in a horizontal relationship, rather than a passive onlooker,&rdquo; Kim Hern Sik, a pop culture expert, explained to ABC News.</p>
<p>Lee said when idols die by suicide, for the fans who felt a connection with the stars, the &ldquo;sense of loss is tremendous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, many individuals who attempted suicide would use the same method as a celebrity who recently died by suicide, with younger females most likely to be influenced to do so, according to a report in 2015 by Dr. Myung Woojae, a psychiatrist at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps an example of the double-edged sword of K-pop celebrity &ndash; idols quickly can go from being supported and revered through active communication with fans, but an unfounded rumor or mixed reactions to personal comments could quickly result in terrible mental anguish.</p>
<p>Cyberbullying victims</p>
<p>Both Sulli and Goo recently had been victims of cyberbullying, receiving hateful comments as false rumors about them spread online. Sulli had been outspoken about freedom of choice to not wear bras and joined a feminist campaign, viewed as brave decisions in a still-conservative society.</p>
<p>Goo was criticized online and accused of having plastic surgery, to which she later publicly admitted. She also endured a scandalous breakup with a boyfriend, a hair designer who allegedly threatened to expose her by using a sex tape.</p>
<p>Many who succeed in K-pop do so as teens, training fiercely and coming of age knowing only the world of show business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem is, when idols act immaturely, the public doesn&rsquo;t view them as minors and is consequently much less forgiving when they make even little mistakes,&rdquo; Choi Ji-eun, a pop culture columnist, told ABC News. &ldquo;They are in constant fear that other people will hate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As idols are subject to stricter moral and ethical standards, they often become the center of gossip and suffer from severe criticism as well as cyberbullying when they are involved in unwanted scandals, Kim added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idols are, despite their young age, influential figures with wealth and fame, and, as a result, are recognized as individuals who are vicariously realizing the youth&rsquo;s hopes and dreams,&rdquo; Kim continued. &ldquo;At the same time, however, they are the subject of jealousy. In South Korea, celebrities, including young idols, are held to much higher standards, which can cause intense amount of stress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ABC News&rsquo; Hakyung Kate Lee, Hansol Park and Kapkoo Kwon contributed to this report.</p>
