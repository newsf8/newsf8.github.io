去年奪下隊史首冠的多倫多暴龍隊，前看板球星DeMar DeRozan，最近與Nate Robinson進行的Instagram Live直播中討論到暴龍隊史最佳球員，DeRozan豪不猶豫表示就是Kyle Lowry。</p>
<p>DeRozan過去與Lowry組成暴龍後場雙槍，2人合作6個球季，共有5季殺進季後賽，卻始終未能奪冠，讓暴龍隊老闆Masai Ujiri在2017-18球季結束後做出改變，將DeRozan與時任馬刺隊明星Kawhi Leonard進行交易，終於在去年賽季拿下隊史首座冠軍。</p>
<p>本季暴龍雖然未能留下Leonard，但還是打出46勝18負、東區第2的優異戰績，其中主控Lowry場均能貢獻19.7分、4.8籃板、7.7助攻，且根據資料，Lowry在效力的8年中，場均能攻下17分、7.2助攻、4.9個籃板，命中率達到42%。</p>
<p>近期由於新冠肺炎（俗稱武漢肺炎）疫情延燒，NBA距離開打遙遙無期，而最近都與女兒一同共度時光的DeRozan，在與前NBA球員Robinson的Instagram Live直播中，討論到Lowry在暴龍隊史的定位，DeRozan豪不猶豫表示：「我會評價他為暴龍隊史上最佳的球員。」</p>
<p>在直播中，DeRozan也另外分享一個小故事，從小視已故籃球巨星Kobe Bryant為偶像的他，平常都會身著Kobe球鞋征戰球場，然而在一次與Kobe的對戰，他卻選擇換上喬丹10代上陣，DeRozan笑稱：「這讓Kobe非常惱怒。」</p>

<h3 id="kyle-lowry-is-the-best-all-time-raptors-player-says-former-teammate">Kyle Lowry is the Best All-Time Raptors Player, Says Former Teammate</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/images-17.jpg" alt="img">
Kyle Lowry has been playing for Toronto Raptors for the last eight years. For six of those years, he has been an NBA All-Star. His achievement is not a surprise, as consider him among the best guards of his generation. However, his former teammate DeMar DeRozan went a little further, saying he is the best player to have played for the Raptors.</p>
<p>DeRozan played for the Raptors between 2009 and 2018. In 2012, Lowry joined the Raptors after a three-year stint with the Houston Rockets. While DeRozan left in 2018, the Raptors, with Lowry, won the NBA Championship in 2019.</p>
<p>DeRozan recently went live on Instagram, where he said that Lowry was the best Raptors player. Although a few would want to include Kawhi Leonard in the debate for the best Raptor, his stint with the team did not last more than a year. Lowry was more deserving, simply because of his long stint with the team, according to DeRozan.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Wednesday the 25th of March also was Lowry’s birthday. Many on Twitter wished the six-time All-Star a Happy Birthday, while others called him the best player of the Raptors.</p>

<h3 id="suspension-journal-what-if-kyle-lowrys-shot-in-game-5-of-the-finals-had-gone-in">Suspension Journal: What if Kyle Lowry’s shot in Game 5 of the Finals had gone in?</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OXtkfQTJ2-TDuYOHm62pAVBOM6M=/0x1009:1743x1922/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19825630/1149303869.jpg.jpg" alt="img">
As I noted in my previous “What If” entry, I’d love to keep the focus here on some lesser-known moments in Raptors history, and how the “butterfly effect” of changing one thing can change multiple other things down the road (like how Jalen Rose not breaking his hand leads to Don Nelson coaching the Raptors and the Raptors leading the three-point revolution).</p>
<p>This one&hellip; is not exactly that. It’s a BIG moment. And, the different outcome doesn’t actually really change anything. It is, perhaps a little more of a personal wish-fulfillment exercise.</p>
<p>But I think it’s a fun one nonetheless!</p>
<p>What if&hellip; Kyle Lowry hit the game-winning shot in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals?</p>
<p>What actually happened? In a moment that’s now largely forgotten, since the Raptors went on to win Game 6, Kyle Lowry had a chance to beat the Golden State Warriors and clinch Toronto’s first NBA title in Game 5 of the 2019 Finals.</p>
<p>With Warriors leading 106-105, the Raptors had the last shot. The Warriors clearly didn’t want Kawhi Leonard beating them, and he gave up the rock to Fred VanVleet, who found Lowry in the corner. But his buzzer-beating attempt was blocked — barely! — by Draymond Green.</p>
<p>It was a sensational defensive play — but for Raptors fans, it was an anti-climactic finish to what was a terrific, unbelievably intense Game 5.</p>
<p>What happened in a parallel universe? Kyle hits the shot. Raptors win! The Raptors are NBA champs, just as they are in our reality, except:</p>
<p>The Raptors win at home. You saw what the city was like after the Raptors won Game 6 of the Finals on the road; I have to imagine it would have been even crazier had they won Game 5 at home. I wonder if I’d even have made it out of the arena!</p>
<p>Kawhi Leonard’s otherworldly 10-2 run goes down as one of the great sequences in NBA history. It really, really sucks that this run is largely forgotten, since the Raptors lost. It pretty much blew my mind.</p>
<p>We have a proper, signature go-to play from the 2019 Finals, which we don’t really have. (Fred VanVleet’s Game 6 primal scream seems to get the most replay). The Leonard run and Lowry’s shot would be replayed forever and ever. Heck, the entire final five minutes —Leonard’s run, the three straight threes from the splash brothers, Lowry’s game winner — would go down as one of the great Finals quarters of all time.</p>
<p>Nick Nurse’s inexplicable momentum shifting timeout never becomes a topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Kevin Durant’s injury (and Toronto’s crowd reaction) becomes even more of a topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Klay Thompson never blows out his knee in Game 6, and the Warriors don’t become the worst team in the league in 2019-20.</p>
<p>The Raptors become the first team to ever win two series on buzzer-beating walk-offs in the same postseason.</p>
<p>Kyle Lowry becomes perhaps the greatest hero in Toronto sports history.</p>
<p>It’s the last one that is perhaps the most interesting. Lowry went out and delivered an incredible Game 6 performance, one that seems to have changed a lot of minds about him; folks who for years (incorrectly) insisted “he sucks in the playoffs” finally realized how great he is. It was a masterful game in and of itself.</p>
<p>If he’d hit that Game 5 shot, though, I think the reaction would have been even greater. Would he be as lionized as, say, Kyrie Irving, who has been living off of his one moment of glory in 2016, even though he’s been average (at best) since then? Would Lowry’s hall-of-fame case be cemented by it? Would he have won Finals MVP!?</p>
<p>Definitely not the last one, not with Leonard’s performance (maybe Kyle’d have gotten that Fred VanVleet vote though!) but I do think it would have elevated him even further in people’s minds.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the outcome of this “What If” doesn’t really change a thing. I’m obviously beyond thrilled that the Raptors won the title in Game 6 and that Lowry was so awesome in that game.</p>
<p>But man, it would have been just that little bit sweeter to win it at home in Game 5, on a walk-off Kyle Lowry buzzer beater. I’d probably still be crying tears of joy about it.
