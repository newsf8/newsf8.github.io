<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and ex-girlfriend of the late US convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has been denied bail in a high-profile sex case.</p>
<p>At a hearing via video link, a New York judge said she would remain in custody while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking minors for Epstein.</p>
<p>Ms Maxwell, who pleaded not guilty, will go on trial in July 2021.</p>
<p>Her lawyers had said she was at risk of contracting coronavirus in prison.</p>
<p>Epstein died in prison on 10 August 2019 as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was determined to be suicide.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tried to flee&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Maxwell, who was arrested on 2 July, faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>During Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing, federal prosecutors said she was an &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; flight risk and should remain in custody.</p>
<p>In a filing, they said that when FBI agents visited her property on 2 July, they identified themselves and asked her to open the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a window, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee to another room in the house, quickly shutting a door behind her,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>They added: &ldquo;Agents were ultimately forced to breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her lawyers denied that she was a flight risk and asked for her release on bail of $5m (£4m). The requested bail was secured by a $3.75m property in the UK.</p>
<p>Ms Maxwell&rsquo;s lawyers also said her detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, put her at &ldquo;serious risk&rdquo; of contracting coronavirus.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege that between 1994 and 1997, Ms Maxwell helped Epstein groom girls as young as 14. They have said that they expect &ldquo;one or more victims&rdquo; to testify.</p>
<p>Four of the charges Ms Maxwell faces relate to the years 1994-97 when she was, according to the indictment, among Epstein&rsquo;s closest associates and also in an &ldquo;intimate relationship&rdquo; with him. The other two charges are allegations of perjury in 2016.</p>
<p>The indictment says Ms Maxwell &ldquo;assisted, facilitated, and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom and ultimately abuse victims known to Maxwell and Epstein to be under the age of 18&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?</p>
<p>Ms Maxwell is the daughter of the late British media mogul Robert Maxwell.</p>
<p>A well-connected figure, she is said to have introduced Epstein to many of her wealthy and powerful friends, including Bill Clinton and the Duke of York (who was accused in the 2015 court papers of touching a woman at Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s US home, although the court subsequently struck out allegations against the duke).</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace has said that &ldquo;any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors&rdquo; by the duke was &ldquo;categorically untrue&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ms Maxwell, who has mostly been out of public view since 2016, was arrested at her remote estate in Bradford, New Hampshire, on 2 July.</p>

Judge Denies Bail For Ghislaine Maxwell, Longtime Confidant Of Jeffrey Epstein</p>

<p>A federal judge denied bail Tuesday for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime confidant of disgraced financier and convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying she posed a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; risk of flight before her trial on sexual exploitation charges.</p>
<p>The judge set a tentative trial date of July 12, 2021.</p>
<p>Maxwell was arrested on July 2 after being indicted in New York over the alleged recruitment and grooming of underage girls in the 1990s to be sexually abused by Epstein. She entered a plea of not guilty at Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing, which was held by video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The combination of the seriousness of the crimes, the potential length of the sentence, the strength of the government&rsquo;s case at this stage, the defendant&rsquo;s foreign connections and the defendant&rsquo;s substantial financial resources all create both the motive and the opportunity to flee,&rdquo; U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said.</p>
<p>The risks of releasing Maxwell on bail, therefore, Nathan concluded, &ldquo;are simply too great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge ruled at the conclusion of the nearly three-hour hearing during which Maxwell&rsquo;s attorney argued that his client should be released on a strict bail package, while the government said that no combination of factors short of detention could guarantee her appearance for trial.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe called Maxwell &ldquo;the very definition of a flight risk.&rdquo; Moe pointed to her substantial financial resources as well as her British and French citizenships, the latter being of particular note, the prosecutor said, because France does not extradite its own citizens.</p>
<p>The court also heard from two of Epstein&rsquo;s alleged victims, both of whom urged the judge to deny bail. One of the women, Annie Farmer, said she was 16 years old when she met Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a sexual predator who groomed and abused me and countless other children and young women,&rdquo; Farmer told the judge. &ldquo;She has never shown any remorse for her heinous crimes or the devastating, lasting effects her actions caused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s attorney, Mark Cohen, pushed back against the government&rsquo;s allegations, saying prosecutors were merely trying to throw &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; at his client. He said Maxwell is not Epstein, and that she is willing and able to work with the court to cobble together a bail package that would assuage any concerns about her fleeing.</p>
<p>He rejected the government&rsquo;s allegations that Maxwell was trying to hide from the authorities by holing up on an estate in New Hampshire. Cohen said his client was only trying to avoid the vitriol and public spotlight that had followed her since Epstein&rsquo;s arrest a year ago.</p>
<p>Epstein faced sex trafficking charges over alleged actions in the early 2000s. He was remanded to custody pending trial, and soon after he killed himself in a federal lockup in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, Maxwell faces charges of her own. She was indicted on six counts, including conspiring to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, and enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts. She also faces perjury charges over allegedly lying during a deposition in a civil suit related to allegations against Epstein.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Maxwell recruited and groomed underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. Prosecutors allege Maxwell took the underage girls on shopping trips and to the movies, asking them personal questions about themselves and their families, all in an effort to build a rapport with them and pave the way for later sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Maxwell then attempted to normalize sexual abuse, undressing in front the victims or involving them in activities including &ldquo;sexualized massages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell has previously denied those allegations, including in civil cases brought by Epstein&rsquo;s accusers.

<p>NEW YORK — Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime associate charged with luring young girls so the late financier could sexually abuse them, pleaded not guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday at a hearing in which women who accused her of enabling their abuse gave statements denouncing her “heinous” crimes.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan presided over the arraignment and bail hearing for Maxwell, who prosecutors have accused of helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse girls as young as 14 from 1994 to 1997 and lying about her role in depositions in 2016. The judge was expected to rule on whether to grant bail.</p>
<p>Nathan also scheduled a trial date for July 12, 2021.</p>

<p>Maxwell, 58 was charged with six criminal counts, including four related to transporting minors for illegal sexual acts and two for perjury. Prosecutors argued at the hearing against Maxwell’s bid for bail, describing her as an extreme flight risk.</p>

<p>“Not guilty, your honor,” Maxwell said, after the judge asked her how she wished to plead to the charges.</p>
<p>Maxwell appeared by video from the Brooklyn jail where she is being held. She appeared tired, with her hair pulled back and was wearing a brown T-shirt and tortoiseshell glasses.</p>
<p>Alison Moe, a federal prosecutor, said the government’s investigation is ongoing, but did not currently anticipate seeking an amended indictment expanding the charges against Maxwell.</p>

<p>Annie Farmer, who has accused the defendant of enabling her abuse, said Maxwell “has never shown any remorse for her heinous crimes” and told the court “the danger Maxwell poses must be taken seriously.”</p>
<p>“She is a sexual predator who groomed and abused me and countless other children and young women,” Farmer told the court.</p>

<p>“Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have done what he did,” an unidentified accuser said in a statement.</p>
<p>This accuser’s statement said she knew Maxwell for more than 10 years and still felt threatened, adding, “If she is out, I need to be protected.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors urged detention because they said Maxwell is a flight risk.</p>
<p>“The defendant has the ability to live in hiding, she’s good at it,” and Moe said has demonstrated she can “live off the grid, indefinitely.” Moe noted that it took a year after Epstein’s arrest to find her.</p>
<p>The wealthy socialite’s lawyers sought a bail package including a $5 million bond and home confinement with electronic monitoring.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said her wealth and multiple citizenships – American, French and British – also supported the need for detention.</p>
<p>Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend and longtime associate, was arrested on July 2 in Bradford, New Hampshire, where authorities said she was hiding out at a 156-acre (63 hectares) property she bought in December in an all-cash transaction with her identity shielded. Maxwell has been held since July 6 at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a Brooklyn jail.</p>

<p>Epstein was charged in July 2019 with sexually exploiting dozens of girls and women from 2002 to 2005 at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. He hanged himself on Aug. 10 at age 66 in a Manhattan jail.</p>
<p>Prosecutors accused Maxwell of luring girls as young as 14 by asking them about their lives, schools and families and taking them shopping or to movies – acts, they said, that served as “the prequel” to Epstein’s abuse. Epstein has been linked socially to several powerful figures including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said on Monday that when FBI agents went to arrest Maxwell, they had to forcibly enter her home, where she hid in an interior room, and found a cellphone wrapped in tin foil in an apparent effort to evade detection.</p>

<p>Maxwell also used former British military personnel to guard her in New Hampshire, prosecutors said.</p>

A U.S. judge on Tuesday denied bail for Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s longtime associate charged with luring young girls so the late financier could sexually abuse them, after she pleaded not guilty at a hearing in which two women decried her actions as heinous.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected Maxwell&rsquo;s bid for bail, agreeing with prosecutors that the wealthy socialite posed a flight risk. Maxwell, the judge said during a hearing lasting more than two hours, has &ldquo;demonstrated sophistication in hiding her resources and herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No combination of conditions could reasonably assure her presence in court,&rdquo; Nathan said in ordering continued confinement.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have accused Maxwell, 58, of helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse girls as young as 14 from 1994 to 1997 and lying about her role in depositions in 2016.</p>
<p>Nathan set a trial date for July 12, 2021.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 58, appeared by video from the Brooklyn jail where she is being held. She appeared tired, with her hair pulled back, and was wearing a brown T-shirt and tortoiseshell glasses.</p>
<p>Arrested on July 2, Maxwell has been charged with six criminal counts, including four related to transporting minors for sexual assaults and two for perjury. Nathan said the evidence at this stage &ldquo;appears strong&rdquo; against Maxwell, who faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.</p>

<p>Two women who have accused Maxwell of enabling their abuse testified at the hearing. One of them, Annie Farmer, said Maxwell &ldquo;has never shown any remorse for her heinous crimes&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the danger Maxwell poses must be taken seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a sexual predator who groomed and abused me and countless other children and young women,&rdquo; Farmer told the court.</p>
<p>In a statement read to the court by federal prosecutor Alison Moe, an unidentified second woman said, &ldquo;Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have done what he did.&rdquo; The woman said she knew Maxwell for more than 10 years and still felt threatened, adding, &ldquo;If she is out, I need to be protected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prosecutors have accused Maxwell of luring girls by asking them about their lives, schools and families and taking them shopping or to movies — &ldquo;the prequel&rdquo; to Epstein&rsquo;s abuse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Off the grid, indefinitely&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s lawyers had sought a bail package including a $5-million US bond and home confinement with electronic monitoring.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Mark Cohen had argued that Maxwell was not a flight risk and did not attempt to flee the premises when authorities arrived to arrest her. Maxwell was &ldquo;not running out of the house, not looking for some secret tunnel,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>
<p>He added Maxwell was being kept in a room at the jail with lights on at all times and at one point was not allowed to shower for 72 hours. Cohen also argued Maxwell could contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in jail.</p>
<p>But, in arguing against bail, Moe said Maxwell has demonstrated she can &ldquo;live off the grid, indefinitely,&rdquo; noting it took a year after Epstein&rsquo;s arrest to find her. Prosecutors said her wealth and multiple citizenships — American, French and British — also supported the need for detention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendant has the ability to live in hiding. She&rsquo;s good at it,&rdquo; Moe told the court.</p>
<p>Maxwell, Epstein&rsquo;s former girlfriend and longtime associate, was arrested in Bradford, N.H., where authorities said she was hiding out at a sprawling property she bought in December in an all-cash transaction with her identity shielded.</p>
<p>Epstein was charged in July 2019 with sexually exploiting dozens of girls and women from 2002 to 2005 at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla. He hanged himself on Aug. 10 at age 66 in a Manhattan jail. Epstein has been linked socially to several powerful figures including U.S. President Donald Trump, former president Bill Clinton and Britain&rsquo;s Prince Andrew.

GHISLAINE Maxwell wept after her bail was denied as she knows she faces being in jail for the rest of her life, a lawyer for Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s victims as claimed.</p>
<p>American attorney Lisa Bloom was speaking on ITV&rsquo;s Lorraine this morning as she represents six of the victims of the paedo billonaire&rsquo;s sex trafficking scheme.</p>

<p>8 Lisa Bloom was speaking on ITV&rsquo;s Lorraine</p>
<p>Ms Bloom was speaking as Maxwell - who is accused of being Epstein&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;madam&rdquo; - was denied bail after appearing via video link at a court in New York.</p>
<p>The British socialite, 58, has been charged with six counts of sex trafficking and perjury over her relationship with Epstein.</p>
<p>Judge Alison Nathan set a trial date for July 12, 2021, after prosecutors argued she was a flight risk as she was denied the £4million bail package.</p>
<p>Ms Bloom said her clients were &ldquo;devastated&rdquo; when Epstein escaped justice after committing suicide in prison - so they are happy to see the authorities keeping a &ldquo;close eye on Maxwell&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maxwell - who was was wearing a brown t-shirt and removed her tortoise-shell framed glasses as she addressed the court - wept as she was denied bail.</p>
<p>Ms Bloom said: &ldquo;She cried at the end when bail was denied and she probably knows she&rsquo;s going to be incarcerated at least until the trial starts and maybe for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that was real. The consequences of her actions are catching up with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;I represent six women who allege they were abused by Epstein and one also has claims against Maxwell for sexual abuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was really traumatised at the mere mention of Maxwell&rsquo;s name, but she is pleased the wheels of justice appear to be turning. It&rsquo;s been decades these victims have been trying to get justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My clients were devastating when Epstein escaped justice. So of course they should keep a close eye on Maxwell. &quot;</p>

<p>Ms Bloom said she expected Maxwell to attempt to seek out a plea bargain as she pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>It is believed she could turn over other members of Epstein&rsquo;s inner circle in exchange for a lighter sentence - with billionaire rubbing shoulders alongside many rich and powerful people.</p>
<p>The attorney said: &ldquo;95 per cent of our cases end in plea bargains, so that would not surprise me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think at this stage the prosecutors will give her a deal if they did not include very serious prison time and I don&rsquo;t think she would accept that at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her lawyers have some technical arguments to make to try and get the case thrown out by saying it was filed too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Bloom added she could also see Prince Andrew - a former friend of Maxwell and Epstein - called as a witness, saying he is not &ldquo;above the law&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Duke of York strongly denies any wrongdoing in his friendship with the couple and said he had suspicions of the allegations.</p>

<p>Maxwell, the daughter of late British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, allegedly groomed her lover Epstein&rsquo;s young victims to endure sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Court documents claim she was sometimes even there when he abused them.</p>
<p>Two of Epstein&rsquo;s accusers implored the judge to keep Maxwell detained after she was arrested by the FBI at a mansion in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Annie Farmer said was a sexual predator who &ldquo;groomed and abused me&rdquo; and claimed she &ldquo;lied under oath and tormented her survivors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s lawyers have argued that Epstein&rsquo;s death last August has left her being &ldquo;substituted&rdquo; with the billionaire in the eyes of victims and the media.</p>
<p>She claims to have had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, and had previously never been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation.</p>

<p>Maxwell has always denied any allegations against her over her alleged involvement in the sex trafficking scheme.</p>
<p>She is claimed to have posed posed as a journalist called &ldquo;Jen Marshall&rdquo; to purchase the $1million house in New Hampshire in November 2019.</p>
<p>Her lawyers claim that she was kept in solitary confinement for 72 hours without a shower while being blasted with glaring lights.</p>
<p>Her attorney Mark Cohen said: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the monster that&rsquo;s been portrayed by the media and government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He argued that preparing for trial with Maxwell in jail, particularly given the current restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, would be &ldquo;just not realistic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maxwell looked down as Farmer described her as a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; and a &ldquo;sexual predator&rdquo; who shouldn&rsquo;t be released.</p>
<p>At times, Maxwell fidgeted in her chair and took sips of water from a white cup - and on a few occasions, she appeared to wipe tears from her face.</p>
<p>Several of Maxwell&rsquo;s family members were also listening to the proceedings via audio link.</p>
<p>Her pals have defended her in the press, claiming she is not a &ldquo;cartoon villain&rdquo; and is &ldquo;determined to prove her innocence&rdquo;.</p>

By LARRY NEUMEISTER and TOM HAYS, Associated Press</p>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, will remain behind bars until trial after she was denied bail Tuesday as a risk to flee rather than face charges she recruited girls for the financier to sexually abuse more than two decades ago.</p>
<p>Two Epstein accusers implored the judge to keep the British socialite detained after she pleaded not guilty to the charges during a video court hearing in Manhattan.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan said even the most restrictive form of release would be insufficient to ensure Maxwell would not flee, particularly now that she knows a conviction could result in up to 35 years in prison.</p>
<p>As the judge explained her reasoning for denying bail, Maxwell dropped her head repeatedly, appearing dejected. At one point, she appeared to wipe a tear from underneath one eye as she sat alone in a room at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she has been housed since last week.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 58, has been held without bail since her July 2 arrest at her million-dollar New Hampshire estate, where prosecutors say she refused to open the door for FBI agents, who busted through to find her in an interior room. Her lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, told the judge that Maxwell was in her pajamas and had followed security protocol calling for her to retreat to her room if any disturbance occurred outside.</p>
<p>The judge rejected Cohen&rsquo;s claim that Maxwell was hiding from the public and the media after getting threats rather than investigators when she bought a $1 million mansion late last year.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe said Maxwell posed as a journalist, &ldquo;Jen Marshall,&rdquo; when she purchased the New Hampshire estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has the ability to live off the grid indefinitely,&rdquo; Moe said, citing Maxwell&rsquo;s wealth and extensive international ties, along with citizenship in the U.S., the United Kingdom and France.</p>
<p>She said Maxwell was vague about her finances after her arrest because &ldquo;she cannot remember off the top of her head how many millions of dollars she has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she rejected Cohen&rsquo;s contention that prosecutors were engaging in &ldquo;spin&rdquo; by twisting facts to portray his client in the worst light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not dirt. It is not spin,&rdquo; Moe said. Prosecutors, she said, planned to hold Maxwell accountable for &ldquo;chilling conduct&rdquo; when Maxwell recruited at least three girls, one as young as 14, for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 1997.</p>
<p>As part of the government&rsquo;s presentation, Moe read aloud a statement by one female accuser while another, Annie Farmer, by phone urged the court to detain Maxwell. Farmer said Maxwell was a &ldquo;sexual predator who groomed and abused me.&rdquo; She said Maxwell &ldquo;lied under oath and tormented her survivors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An indictment alleged that Maxwell groomed the victims to endure sexual abuse and was sometimes there when Epstein abused them. It also alleged she lied during a 2016 deposition in a civil case.</p>
<p>Epstein killed himself in August 2019, several weeks after he was also confronted by two accusers, including Farmer, at a bail hearing. They insisted he remain in jail while awaiting sex trafficking charges that alleged he abused girls at his Manhattan and Florida mansions in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>In court papers, Maxwell&rsquo;s lawyers argued that Epstein&rsquo;s death left the media &ldquo;wrongly trying to substitute her for Epstein — even though she&rsquo;d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had never been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always denied any allegations of claimed misconduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s lawyers pushed to have her released on $5 million bail. They said she &ldquo;vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the presumption of innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge set a trial date for July 2021.</p>
<p>Afterward, some accusers praised the decision to keep Maxwell detained.</p>
<p>In a statement, Virginia Roberts Giuffre said she was &ldquo;thrilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey Epstein would not have been able to fulfill his sick desires,&rdquo; Giuffre said. &ldquo;Ghislaine preyed on me when I was a child. As with every other of her and Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s victims, I will have to live with what she did to me for the rest of my life. The rest of her life should be spent behind bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jennifer Araoz, who says Epstein raped her when she was 15, said in a statement that she was &ldquo;once again able to take another breath as Ghislaine Maxwell will be in jail until at least her trial date next July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: “Knowing that she is incarcerated for the foreseeable future allows me, and my fellow survivors, to have faith that we are on the right path.”
