<p>This is the final compilation of contributions to the “Sentencing the Present” series. For previous seminars, see part one, part two, part three, part four, and part five.</p>
<p>A sentence is protean: It can describe, question, or cry out. A sentence is critical: In passing judgment, it names wrongs, makes decisions, and declares publicly. In a spirit of both open inquiry and political advocacy, and inspired by the response of readers to our own “Theses for Theory in a Time of Crisis,” the past several weeks we have convened an ongoing conversation of critical voices reflecting on the history of the present and the possibilities of the future. To start, we asked some of today’s most pressing thinkers to offer a “thesis,” raise a question or reconsider a word. Our open invitation brought in new voices. The over-thirty texts collected below have come in response to this prompt:</p>
<p>In light of Marx’s 1843 conception of critical thought, how does your perspective contribute to “the self-clarification of the struggles and wishes of the age”? In a time of social breakdown and uncertainty, we find that critique comes almost too easily. Hence we also take inspiration from the historian E. P. Thompson, who wrote in his 1959 call for the New Left, “It is always the business of the Left to foster the utmost aspiration compatible with existing reality — and then some more beyond.”</p>
<p>Our contributors answered our call with concepts to think with and visions, however small, to mobilize us. In this final compilation, we have gathered sentences published in five parts between May 7 and June 4 to create a textual constellation with new adjacencies. Reflections from early weeks of coronavirus uncertainty rub shoulders with more politically determinate considerations from the final week, which followed the police murder of George Floyd and the uprisings that ensued. Several insightful conversations developed between contributors over the course of the weeks. Under the category “Value &amp; Revaluing,” authors debate the meaning of the term crisis and its value as a theoretical frame. The final category, “Humanity,” set contributors in dialogue about how the pandemic reshaped conceptions of the human, human rights, and the humanities.</p>
<p>Next week we will publish an essay on what we learned in the course of this project. For now, we offer an archive of thinking in, with, and through the pandemic — or more precisely, of thinking in, with, and through a “pandemic within a pandemic,” as California Representative Barbara Lee put it in calling for the creation of a truth, racial healing, and transformation commission. In this spirit of this re-framing, we encourage our readers who are able to participate in local demonstrations supporting defunding and demilitarizing police forces — to affirm and work toward abolitionist horizons.</p>

<p>This morning, waking into sirens, I thought the city was under attack. I blinked and wondered what would happen if it were — if, on top of the ravages of the virus, the job losses, the hunger, the fear, uncertainty, and rage — the city was actually under military attack. In this pandemic, the United States has continued bombing Iraq. It maintains sanctions on Covid-19-stricken Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela over the protests of the UN. Recently, it launched naval ships into the Caribbean, one of the largest military deployments in the region since the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama. There is a poignancy in having a large fleet of destroyers, combat ships, and cutters sailing towards war while, until the end of April, the USNS Comfort, a 45-year-old converted oil tanker, was docked in NYC’s harbor. While the morgues stand full and corpses are packed in container trucks, the Comfort offered 1,000 mostly unused hospital beds. Before New York, the Comfort was docked in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (2017), in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina (2005), and in the Persian Gulf after the U.S. invasion of Iraq (2002). In each place, the services of this death ship were too little, too late. The Comfort illustrates this broken country’s priorities: endless new technologies for death, and for life, in bitter afterthought, the leftover disposable parts. Every evening, people lean out windows to clap, to bang pots and pans, to whistle and howl for life, and to acknowledge the people risking their own lives to keep us all alive. The noise rises to the sky. I join them with this plea: End the sanctions, stop the wars, cancel the rents, nationalize healthcare, and let us all survive this curse of a pandemic.</p>
<p>— Christina Heatherton, New York City (May 22, 2020)</p>
<p>Forty: 2020, an election year, marks 40 years since Reagan was first elected, 40 years of mistrust in government, cynicism about collectivity, and disparagement of democracy. That is a long time, but the number 40 comes with hope. In the Bible, 40 is the number of years it took for the slave generation of Israelites to die out in the desert and for their children to be raised up for freedom. The tents that dot New York’s Central Park call to my mind the Bible’s desert dwellings, the manna that fell, and the violence the people witnessed and suffered during these long 40 years. The tents also remind us that in quarantine we mourn for the dead in isolation, though the dead cannot be mourned in isolation; they can only be missed. The word “quarantine” dates back to seventeenth-century Venice and refers to the 40 days of isolation imposed upon ships at ports to minimize the threat of contagion before landing. Quarantine structures temporally what the Exodus story figures spatially: a desert of deprivation with promise awaiting us at the end. That promise is not just a return to normal. The animals now taking to our emptied city streets are showing the way. They are turning up in places where the prior partition of the sensible said they did not belong. They do not encounter the expected resistance; so they keep coming. There is a lesson there for us. In the fast time of neoliberalism’s everyday, we are not all “essential workers,” but we have all been told daily, for decades, it is essential that we work. Must it be so? Once we exit quarantine, let’s turn the tents in Central Park into a multipurpose memorial: a monument of the 40 years lost, a place of mourning for the dead, a community meeting place to dream, and to idle, a polling station to vote ourselves out of this mess. A public thing.</p>
<p>— Bonnie Honig, Warren, VT (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Covid-19 disease seems to be changing everything, but it also confirms what we already knew: We live in a global world in which a pandemic immediately affects all dimensions of life. It intensifies the enormous inequalities of our societies, bearing down on the most vulnerable, and, at the same time, it reinforces the biopolitical dimension of our states. This means the Left will have to invent new practices able to replace — at least transitionally — traditional forms of mass mobilization, starting with the rehabilitation of underpaid essential work. This is the meaning of the spontaneous manifestations of people who clap from their windows for ambulance and bus drivers. Until now, we have experienced an amazing and heartening wave of solidarity and collective mutual aid. A country like Italy, whose political stage was dominated by a racist and xenophobic leader until just a few months ago, is currently welcoming Chinese, Cuban, and Albanian doctors and nurses like heroes. People seem to have understood that we need a global and solidary response. But I am not sure that this feeling will still prevail after a year of economic depression. Despite the risk of sounding irremediably archaic, I would say that we have to be prepared for a durable change, and this might update the old alternative: socialism or barbarism, either a New Deal for the twenty-first century or neoliberal governance with even more inegalitarian and authoritarian features. A politics for the future should find a convergence between the struggle for saving the planet and the struggle for a “universal right to respiration” — as Achille Mbembe pertinently calls it — a right to exist for every living being, regardless of economic status or state sovereignty.</p>
<p>— Enzo Traverso, Ithaca, NY (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>I’m not sure I agree with E. P. Thompson that it should be the job of the Left to “foster the utmost aspiration compatible with existing reality.” All too often, aspiration gets the better of reality, and left-wing platforms are brought to their knees by an idealism unmoored from the social and political realities of winning elections and governing. But in the spirit of Thompson’s challenge, I’ll fill the glass half full. It’s unthinkable that we cannot do better than we have done. And in that sense, the coronavirus offers us a chance. So much of what we see as wrong around us — vast inequality, political corruption, racism and other forms of prejudice, lack of accountability, environmental destruction, immiseration — attests to the failures of the New Left of the nineteen-sixties and the third way in the nineteen-nineties. Yet suddenly the immutable is questioned. Getting back to business as usual confronts a swelling sense that we no longer know what normal is. Is institutional racism normal? Are vast disparities in life expectancy (before and during Covid-19) normal? Are stagnant wages normal? Is having no health care normal? Most of all, perhaps, and with the United Kingdom very much in mind, why would we carry on believing the various tribunes of the government when they have flunked Social Contract 101: Give us your taxes and your obedience and we’ll protect you. Who could possibly think that now?</p>
<p>— Stephen Hopgood, Oxford, UK (May 15, 2020)</p>
<p>The ______ Virus: The week we stop seeing anyone, the baby, who has never cried much, starts wailing whenever I leave her sight. The internet says it is object permanence. When I am not there, now, she knows I am in the next room, and if she cries long enough (not long) I will come back. You’re telling me, I want to say, but instead, I stand there in the dark and sway like a mountain with wind sighing through it because the world that left last week is in fact gone. We never said goodbye. Everything I read about the pandemic feels like a conspiracy theory: shocking but not surprising. This includes the actual conspiracy theories spreading on social media, some of which happen to be true. (That footage they said came from New York did come from Italy! Those Stanford-affiliated researchers were spreading lies!) I realize this jadedness is just my trying to protect us, if only from having to keep up. We are so lucky. I am so tired. Conspiracy theories raise questions not only of epistemology — how do we know what we know — but also of narratology. Fredric Jameson described them as instances of failed “cognitive mapping,” but if they were really about knowing, the villains could not merge so easily. It would have to be the People’s Liberation Army or Bill Gates, 5G or the Deep State, Homer or another poet of that name. Absence of evidence would not be proof of the enemy’s power to cover his tracks. In the end, what the conspiracist wants to believe in is agency — anyone’s. If someone, somewhere did this, then justice remains possible. In the face of systems failure, the genre preserves the hope stated as law in Hollywood screenwriting manuals: Character x Action = Change. Social media companies are right to start checking the disinformation they help spread, but it would be wrong to imagine that better facts alone will fix this. The internet can connect anything with anything, and a virus capable of halting the world is an ideal projection screen. Trump insists on “Chinese” or “Wuhan virus” to blame a hated “other” and to preserve the illusion that this crisis is a war he can win. By his twisted logic, the surge in attacks on Asian Americans that his words cause constitutes proof of his courage in the face of the experts demanding that he call it “Covid-19.” In his new book, the historian Federico Finchelstein points out that fascists use state power to make their lies come true. Cram hated populations into camps and prisons and they do in fact become dirty and diseased. As those who cannot afford to avoid exposure get sick at work, I fear some will see this not as a crime, but as a confirmation. In response, we need to create new kinds of agents, not just new stories.</p>
<p>— Moira Weigel, Cambridge, MA (May 29, 2020)</p>
<p>One of the most significant ironies of 2020 was the tragicomic timing of the DNC’s coalescing behind Joe Biden, the candidate least likely to present a viable and inclusive response to the Covid-19 crisis, and against Bernie Sanders, whose policies and ideological positions feel more pressing and necessary, as this crisis has indeed heightened the inhumane contradictions and inequalities of our time. One hundred thousand casualties. Thirty million Americans out of work. In the form of “reopen our state” protests, we see how the failures to implement a minimalist social democratic response to post-2008 economic growth has created the space for reactionary backlashes from the right. As someone who studies economic and social rights, as a political activist, and as a resident of Jackson Heights, Queens — called the “epicenter of the epicenter” of the epidemic — I see how political elites have succeeded in limiting what people imagine is possible in this time of great suffering and uncertainty. Andrew Cuomo, our now fantastically popular “progressive neoliberal” governor, skyrockets to celebrity, passing austerity budgets and financially starving our hospitals and schools while one in four people in New York City goes hungry. We celebrate the voluntary efforts of mutual aid networks who deliver groceries and medicines without unifying under a demand that such precarity should never exist. Our biggest task — as scholars, as activists, as citizens — is not to convince the political elites that they should be generous but to transform radically what our neighbors, community members, families, and loved ones think we deserve — and imagine as possible. We should demand nothing less than the very basic, fundamental understanding of our economic and social rights, guaranteed by every level of governance, with radical wealth redistribution as a norm, not a pipe dream.</p>
<p>— Susan Kang, Jackson Heights, Queens, NYC (May 29, 2020)</p>
<p>So much is changing. People are still clinging to hierarchies that may no longer actually exist. Systems of deference, adherence, and dominance may just be based on habit, and no longer on real power or impact. This is true at work, in cliques, in every groupthink we live within. Every time a media outlet cuts away from the presidential non-event, we move closer to a recognition of real value. Every time we stand up to someone we used to defer to because they controlled some aspect of our lives, or had power they never deserved or lived up to, we move towards a new collective. Standing up for the person with no currency defies the void. Sometimes real fears free us from shallow ones.</p>
<p>— Sarah Schulman, New York City (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>Protest (in translation): “The pandemic will change the way we relate to our bodies,” says Achille Mbembe in an interview about the Covid-19 crisis. “Now we all have the power to kill.” Isolation and distancing are ways to “regulate” this power. How to understand a protest in this context? 2019 and the beginning of 2020 were combative in Puerto Rico and in the region. Protests in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico — as well as in Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, among other countries — indicate a great crack in the hegemony, at least ideological, of neoliberalism. Abandoning party lines, the protests were organic, multiple focused on the differential impact of neoliberalism, and on its intensification of the racial and gender violence distinctive of capitalism in all its iterations. The body as a weapon complicates and pauses — if not completely dismantles — resistance. On April 17, La Colectiva Feminista en Construcción, a collective rooted in a black feminist, decolonial praxis, did a “Compra Combativa” (Combative Grocery Shopping). Addressing citizens standing in line at two supermarkets in the San Juan area, La Colectiva discussed the lack of coronavirus tests, the lack of resources in the homes, and government corruption. Complying with the rules of physical distancing, the Compra Combativa focused on the body. Six feet apart, wearing gloves, wearing masks — bodies in resistance, bodies denouncing, bodies in solidarity. Recalling the Black Feminist Friday of 2016, the 2018 Plantón, and the 2019 Feminist Embargo, La Colectiva has inverted the power of the state and capital. They generate power by subverting capital’s technologies of subjection as well as the temporality, desires, and forms of perception that those technologies institute. Consistent with this tactic, the Compra Combativa subverts the body as a weapon, making it a site of solidarity. “If the body is precisely the danger and the threat,” Shariana Ferrer-Núñez of La Colectiva notes, “if it is going to become a weapon, then we are going to use the body precisely in a confrontation to generate a social bond that allows us not only to survive a pandemic but also to directly challenge power and with it, to trace other futures where solidarity is the compass of change.” To protest in times of a pandemic is to build power by nurturing solidarity around life. Poner el cuerpo, staking one’s own body, in this context, is to expose oneself both to the virus and to being a weapon, to yielding one’s power to kill. To protest in times of Covid-19 requires turning the being-weapon that undermines the social bond, that isolates, that feeds fear, into a weapon that attacks hunger, loneliness, repression, dispossession, violence. To protest in times of pandemic is to capture life itself, to generate bonds in relation to it. Since May, people in Chile, Haiti, Bolivia, and Puerto Rico are back in the streets, protesting escalating hunger, precarity, violence. We also saw anti-lockdown protests in the United States — claiming the right to freedom, the need for services such as hair salons, rejecting government intervention. Since May 26, however, thousands are protesting the killing of George Floyd by four police officers in Minneapolis. The organizations that compose the Black Lives Matter movement demand justice for Floyd, condemn the ongoing police killing of black men and women, propose defunding the police. These remarkable protests index the anti-blackness at the root of modernity/coloniality, one that manifests itself in the “premature death” of black people, as Ferrer-Núñez often reminds us, quoting Saidiya Hartman. Hartman writes:</p>
<p>If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America, it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the burden of a too-long memory, but because black lives are still imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago. This is the afterlife of slavery — skewed life chances, limited access to health and education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment.”</p>
<p>The Black Lives Matter protests turn the being-weapon that undermines social bonds into a being-weapon that attacks racism, apathy, sheer violence, and the priority of property and capital over life. To affirm that Black Lives Matter in times of a pandemic that has disproportionately killed black people is likewise to capture life itself, to generate bonds dismantling racism, the racial state, its modalities of violence, its production of this world.</p>
<p>— Rocío Zambrana, Bogotá (June 4, 2020)</p>
<p>Covid-19 revolution: During the first two months of the U.S. shutdown to prevent the overloading of its weakened and ill-prepared hospital system by coronavirus patients, activists struggled to adapt to the new conditions of organizing: Zoom sessions, webinars, live streams, car caravans, carefully orchestrated physically distanced actions. The solution to the problem came from the streets in the last week of May. Outrage over the ceaseless murder of black people led tens of thousands of people across the country to pour into the streets demanding justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. These uprisings were not the first demonstrations of the Covid-19 era. Right-wing protesters had already staged multiple gatherings calling for reopening in the name of liberty. Everyone saw through the ruse: The demonstrations in Michigan were organized by a group funded by the billionaire DeVos family. The demand for a return to work was a demand made from the position of bosses. It wasn’t liberty or death, it was liberty and death, the truth of freedom in the United States: The liberty of some depends on the death of others. The May uprising breaking out in Minnesota and quickly spreading throughout the country ruptured the confining expectations of shutdown life. The tens of thousands of people marching, assembling, and rioting, taking highways and bridges, and burning police cars and stations, demanded more than life. They demanded justice. The demand for justice superseded fear of infection. To say Black Lives Matter was not to conclude that everyone should remain isolated. It was to come together to fight for a new society. In Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder, Lenin says that “for a revolution to take place it is not enough for the exploited and oppressed masses to realize the impossibility of living in the old way, and demand changes.” Revolution only occurs when the people “do not want to live in the old way,” that is when they are prepared to die for it. The last few days of May 2020 showed that thousands of people were willing to risk their lives in the struggle against the racist capitalist system. Between the virus and the economy, there was nothing left to lose. And there is a world to win.</p>
<p>— Jodi Dean, Geneva, NY (June 4, 2020)</p>
<p>Value &amp; Revaluing</p>
<p>The global pathology of our time is one in which corporations function as systematic resource-grabbing and killing machines. Investment banks (debt-creators), weapons manufacturers, biotech firms, big agriculture, oil, gas, and mining companies, water bottlers (like Nestlé), for-profit health systems, prisons, and detention centers — the list goes on: Mechanisms of immense unbridled power actually decide questions of ultimate value, though they are incapable of making value judgments. They are mechanically programmed to sacrifice every value — life, liberty, happiness, health — in draconian pursuit of short-term financial returns as an absolute good. Extractive profiteering is enforcing the absurdist logic of King Midas in a brutal and mindless planetary endgame. Unless corporations as legal-political entities are overmastered by countervailing legal-political constraints, these life-assaulting forces are on course to obliterate the livable biosphere.</p>

<p>Essential labor: Every crisis has its metaphysics, including our current one involving Covid-19. Suddenly we’re talking about what’s “essential,” as if the term now means something deeper than “important.” The conversation is mostly about work. Whose labor is essential? Answering this question even on the best of days, you’ll eventually get to Marx, who — while criticizing Hegel for describing “labor as the essence of man” — spoke of “abstract labor” as the “essence” or value of a commodity destined to circulate. Marx named this essential circulation “the starting-point of capital.” These aren’t specialized questions for a history of theory; they bear on reading the present moment, which theory may elucidate. Check any gubernatorial executive order, and you’ll find that what’s “essential” about labor is merely a list of job descriptions. Never is there an “is,” a definition of essentiality. It’s as if our governments are worried that if they go there, they’ll say too much. At stake in essentiality is the disclosure of a fundamental dynamic that could end this phase of capitalism: Essential workers are ordered to imperil their health in public for unlivable wages with few if any protections (rights, insurance, PPE), and everyone else goes unnamed, unseen, as inessential workers who must risk their lives by receiving no wage and no social protections whatsoever. Our version of capitalism cannot possibly tolerate this dynamic much longer: mandated work leading to walkouts or bodily collapse unto sickness (in either case, cascading breakdowns); and spiraling unemployment far in excess of what capitalists call labor “reserves.” Every metaphysics in a time of crisis has its politics, too, not all of them pursuant to the status quo. We’ve come to a break, a brake… An opportunity with survival at stake.</p>
<p>— Andrew Cole, Athens, GA (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>Security: Progressive politics has always drawn on a series of aspirational values — justice, freedom, equality, recognition, emancipation, welfare, human rights, and solidarity, to name the most prominent — and struggled to combine them into a unified and mutually reinforcing program. One term often left aside is security, which is derived from the Latin securitas, composed of “se” and “cura” meaning without care or concern. Ever since Hobbes, security has often been invoked by conservative or authoritarian regimes to justify their resolve to protect the populace with any means necessary against civil war, anarchy, crime, and foreign threats. The idea of a “national security state,” first introduced during Truman’s presidency, meant amplifying the power of the military and investigative arms of the government. Although not as inimical to democracy as the “state security” apparatuses of communist countries, America’s national security apparatus also prioritized the survival of the prevailing system over its transformation in a more progressive direction. However, the current crisis has revealed with brutal suddenness that without security none of the other goals that have motivated leftist politics can be achieved. Lacking universal health coverage, security of employment, secure supply chains, the prospect of secure retirement, secure access to reliable information, and secure voting rights, we are all threatened with being reduced to vulnerable members of what has justly been called “the precariat.” There is perhaps no more urgent task for the left today than to reclaim the value of “security” — call it the expansion of “social security” — to insure against many other kinds of risks besides penury in old age. And concomitantly, we must make clear to his victims that Trump, caring only for himself, is the callous source of much of the pandemic of insecurity that is the hallmark of our time of troubles.</p>
<p>— Martin Jay, Berkeley, CA (May 15, 2020)</p>
<p>Crisis and non-crisis: This pandemic underscores the relationships between episodic hard times and the ongoing and quotidian hard times that structure the lives of marginalized groups. Covid-19 has revived Rahm Emanuel’s admonition to never let “a serious crisis… go to waste” and the idea that past crises have been generative of progressive change. But while it may “take a crisis” to expand rights and resources for marginalized groups, crises also privilege normative constructions of value, deservingness, and citizenship. Attaching redistributive and liberatory agendas to crises can therefore constrain which issues are addressed, delimiting who gets helped, and reconstituting racial, gender, and economic orders along modified but familiar inegalitarian lines. Whether or not something is a “crisis” is at least partly endogenous to politics and structured by conventions about what is normal and whose pain is tolerable. So while Covid-19 has been labelled and treated as a crisis — a critical juncture deemed worthy of and remediable through government intervention — the structural inequalities it has thrown into relief have more typically been normalized as non-crises — treated as unfortunate but nonetheless natural and inevitable results of unremarkable conditions that are regarded as immune to, and therefore as not warranting, state intervention. For example, Anthony Fauci has framed the racialized health and economic disparities that have translated into disproportionate rates of infection and death among African Americans as external to the crisis and beyond the power of the federal government to remedy. We should disrupt the line between crisis and non-crisis and use policy windows opened by the pandemic to address the ongoing and deeply entrenched inequalities that have been revealed and fueled by it, so that returning to “normal” does not mean, as it so often does, returning to pre-crisis conditions of normalized injustice.</p>
<p>— Dara Z. Strolovitch, Princeton, NJ (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>For critical theory to remain “critical,” extant concepts and frameworks need to be revised, reconfigured, and re-engaged. Dara Strolovitch shows how the notion of “crisis” presupposes the “non-crisis” of quotidian, structural violence against racialized and gendered populations. To avoid Strolovitch’s crisis/non-crisis problematic, we need analytical lenses that focus on the histories and structures undergirding the foundation upon which the pandemic plays out. While neoliberalism, or “disaster capitalism,” is fast becoming the interpretive lens for our moment, critical theory has much to gain by (re-)engaging with frameworks such as “racial capitalism,” “(settler) colonial capitalism,” “capitalist-patriarchy,” and “intersectional Marxism.” These frameworks emphasize the racial, colonial, and patriarchal logics of domination that condition and are conditioned by capitalist accumulation. Our present order differentially conscripts and affects human populations and non-human nature. We need to foreground, and not conceal, the historical, ongoing, uneven, and unrelenting obscenity of the modern world-system for the vast majority.</p>
<p>— Siddhant Issar, St. Louis (May 15, 2020)</p>
<p>Crisis: Used by Hippocrates and Galen, the original Greek “crisis” (krisis) referred to a turning point during the course of a disease, wherein a patient would make a recovery or would die. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn noted that “when we count up the millions of those who died in the [Soviet] camps, we forget to multiply the numbers by two or three.” Any statistic leaves out the individual stories of suffering, which demand an acknowledgment that can never be discharged in the aggregate. Outside of medicine, crisis was used in cases of judgment or decision, as in Thucydides (in reference to an unfinished war) or in Plato (as in the choice between which life to lead). Such uses highlight that the very category of crisis is “structured by conventions about what is normal and whose pain is tolerable,” as Dara Strolovich notes. Not all recoveries nor all deaths are the same (not to mention wars or lives or bedside manners). Crises are not natural kinds. If anything, they oftentimes reveal just how contingent their (worst) outcomes actually are, especially with our technological capabilities, even if their origins are “natural.” Thus, the aptness of the metaphor of the present crisis as an x-ray. In crisis, judgment can follow fixed categories, or such categories may make it practically or theoretically impossible to go on. It may become impossible to judge — to krino — by means of available resources, whether conceptual, imaginative or otherwise. A crisis may demand we invent new categories. A moment of crisis — like a disease, like a war, like a life — may thereby stretch out over months or years. Because Covid-19 is implicated with how we have organized ourselves — with our very form of life — the pandemic reveals that the moment of crisis has already been here, lingering beneath the surface, suggesting a sort of virus within a virus. A wide range of treatments is thereby needed, and the Covid-19 vaccine is not the only cure to be developed. And still, we have the kernel of how to move forward, not the least of which must be a path that acknowledges the ethical standing of every individual, no matter how systemic the outcomes of our intervention must be.</p>

<p>Good science and bad faith: Commentators are still debating what kind of untruth we’re dealing with here. Is he earnestly clueless or science-illiterate? Is he a wily genius or a compulsive liar? Does he simply not care? To lie, in politics or elsewhere, one at least considers the truth first. “Democracy insists on the idea that truth both matters,” historian Sophia Rosenfeld has observed, “and that nobody gets to say definitively what it is.” But not everyone agrees that truth matters in the first place. I’m speaking of those who act in bad faith. Consider Trump’s praise of hydroxychloroquine, in which he implied, without stating outright, its efficacy as a prophylactic and treatment against the coronavirus. When challenged as to why he promoted an unproven drug, he retorted: “I’m not. I’m not.” By positioning himself in the shadowy chasm between his propositions and their performative implications, he exploited the reasonable doubt that any good expert would maintain, construing the margin of error as a failure of expertise. Epistemology is secondary, even irrelevant, in this “coded speech and innuendo.” When left unchallenged, bad-faith actors accrue power. Critique must shine floodlights into that chasm. The gas-lighter may brush off accusations of abuse, but feminist philosophy and political memoir can expose the rhetorical sequences leading to cruel subordination. The troll, when owning the libs, betrays himself with a smirk; a critical typology of trolling differentiates levels of disingenuousness. Yet such diagnoses gather dust on the shelf of righteous moralizing unless they can be leveraged in politics. Since the troll requires an opponent to frustrate and an audience to cheer along, correctives may lie in mutual recognition. Four years ago, Trump invoked “Second Amendment people” without much censure. This time, Twitter flagged his dog whistle, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” for “glorifying violence.” Backed by state power, this threat ought to have seemed more, not less, legitimate. Why not? What changed? As a social movement affirming black lives against police violence gained traction, the life-or-death implications of disingenuous speech have become more shame-inducing to overlook. Yes, perhaps bad faith can never be fully isolated because even earnest people harbor contradictions. While that may be true for particular individuals, it is no foundation for a polity in crisis.</p>
<p>— Benjamin Bernard, Princeton, NJ (June 4, 2020)</p>
<p>The current crisis triggered by the pandemic is only the latest installment in a long series. By adopting perennial crisis and fear as a modus vivendi, we have abdicated our responsibility in shaping our destinies, an imperative inherited from the Enlightenment, in favor of a mostly self-imposed existential anguish. We have tacitly conceded that we no longer make history, we merely endure it. There is much talk of the world “after” the current crisis. Some doubt whether there will be one at all. Yet as Mark Lilla has recently observed, “The post-Covid future doesn’t exist. It will exist only after we have made it.” The ceaseless, complacent, and empty proclamations that “nothing will ever be the same” are a measure of our own sense — and acceptance — that fundamentally, nothing will change. Our futile obsession with the mastery of the conditions of human existence, with our graphs and predictive models at hand, coexists with the inability to assert control over them. All the ethical posturing and political gesticulation in the current performance of responding to the crisis ultimately fail to make up for our collective failure to reclaim responsibility for carving out a new one. We wrongly regard contingency as an aberration, an embarrassing ellipsis, rather than as an opportunity to free ourselves from the catastrophic trajectories we believe we are intent on. Walter Benjamin would have seen this as a potentially revolutionary opening in history to be seized upon. The current state of contingency and impotence may, paradoxically, have reawakened the potential for human action. Indeed, this is another way of understanding the radical uncertainty of the future: as an opportunity to rethink and change our outlooks and conduct towards each other and the planet we inhabit. The Adornoesque tragedy of the present is not that the current world may be gone forever, but that we are disinclined to let it go.</p>

<p>Theory</p>
<p>Emotional intelligence, a constituent of critical theory, expands capacity to confront predatory capitalism, slavery, and consumption. Racism, gender violence, and imprisonment determine survival rates, during and between pandemics as we live and die amid climate devastation, increasing poverty, and repression. Fear and fury are rational responses to abandonment and exploitation by authoritarians as well as to ineffective coalitions with concerned benefactors. As a “super power,” trauma has a role in analysis, leading to resurgent political engagement.</p>
<p>— Joy James, Manhattan, New York City (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>The basic question of all human societies has been who will live and who will die. We in the developed world have been living in a resource-rich fantasyland of apparent prosperity and taken-for-granted comfort. It is and always has been a house of cards. Justice does not mean a return to normal. It starts, at least, with a recognition that the normal was deeply and inherently unjust. There were already population firebreaks before the pandemic, brutal mechanisms of immunity constructed of barbed wire fencing and birthright exclusion. New firebreaks of the reckless and stupid are not defensible in current discourse, which is a victory for decency but maybe a defeat for global equity. The conversation about viral counter-measures and the timeline for “liberating” the economy is muddy because we are not simply brutal, even as we also feel long-term pressures that are scary. We are talking about people and not trees. We lurch on into our near future, caught between the dilemmatic horns of mass death and economic collapse. Is there any resolution here? We must hope so, but whatever it is will not, and should not, mean a return to what went before.</p>
<p>— Mark Kingwell, Toronto (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>All theory is anchored in a social reality, though not all theory acknowledges it. Critical theory works toward liberation from the oppressive demands of power. It is a Marxian inheritance to view religion as one of those lulling discourses of power that shuts down both logical thought and consciousness, two modes that allow us to identify class struggle and overcome social inequalities. Religious people — so some Marxists argue — are more resigned to injustices such as income disparities, class inequalities, gender bias, racial supremacy, and institutional racism as part of their fate or as God’s test of humanity. This resignation abandons fighting back or changing the world. Marx has a point: What could be “practical” or “self-clarifying” in mooring ourselves to a metaphysical anchor, if that is not oxymoronic enough, from which humanity is being tested? The immaterial, a materialist is quick to say, is (politically) immaterial. Yet so far there has not been a functional alternative to religion in the world, nor have the “secular” visions of the present inspired much of a horizon for liberation. A question which seems to invite itself more urgently now that a pandemic is threatening to put “an end to history” is: How well does critical theory fare in theorizing our struggle with a global virus of this magnitude? To what extent does it differ, say, from religion in addressing the self-clarification of the struggles and wishes of our plagued world today? Isn’t it also ironically “critical” to remember that principles of freedom, social justice, equality, and solidarity still carry the DNA of those distant “opium” gods?</p>
<p>— Mohammad Salama, San Francisco (May 15, 2020)</p>
<p>Theory has done better addressing life — flourishing, vulnerable, haunted, distended — than addressing death. Theology has done better addressing death — the fears and hopes it conjures — than addressing life, which it habitually instrumentalizes. Theory that is secularized theology risks ignoring death and instrumentalizing life. Our time of pandemic offers an opportunity for theory to grapple seriously with death, and this may mean grappling with death theologically, with fear and trembling and the hope of liberation.</p>
<p>— Vincent Lloyd, Philadelphia (May 4, 2020)</p>
<p>States are beginning to “reopen,” and those that remain “closed” exempt workers officially “essential” (80 percent, in my city). Restaurants, hair salons, and beaches are becoming the altars of a mass sacrifice, a bloodletting of the poor meant to resurrect the economy. Vincent Lloyd rightfully calls on theory to grapple with death theologically. What would that look like? In the depths of war, Simone Weil wrote that the crucifixion of God is eternal. A theological grappling with death might include a refusal of the logic of resurrection, an insistence that some losses can never be returned, that some things cannot be righted because they were never right to begin with.</p>
<p>— Mac Loftin, Chelsea, MA (May 22, 2020)</p>
<p>Critique, or critical theory, is preferable to theory. Critique, Kant said, reflects on the conditions of possibility of any given phenomenon. One starts, Marx went on, with the apparently self-evident, “trivial thing” to ask under what conditions it has come to be a possible thing. Critical theory’s value is that it reminds that the historical process conditions things, meaning the given is contingent. Critical theory’s danger is that it may mistake the historical process for the given and the given for all that is the case. To avoid that danger, it must remain alert to the possibilities that the given has occluded. The possible is not the given. It is what lives on out of kilter with what is. Living on, it gives hope that the means to living otherwise survive in everything the given has not managed to exhaust. In this way, without the slide into theology, a secular critique honors the dead. It finds their afterlife in the unredeemed possibilities that their passing, natural or catastrophic, suspended but did not annihilate. They live on in their unfinished desires and affections for which our own make way.</p>
<p>— David Lloyd, Los Angeles (May 22, 2020)</p>
<p>Theorizing often forgets its place and so falls out of time. When it issues commands, addressees become foot soldiers. Taking on more than its concepts can bear, it effaces the world it hoped would prove otherwise. Not that one can change the world without interpretation. But as Ofelia Shutte has suggested, deepening thesis eleven, interpretation modifies the world in order to fathom it, and in changing the world prompts the need for further interpretation. The world won’t stand still, becoming, differentiating. Words proliferate, things turn and twist, speakers and addressees change minds and places. So much is being born, so much passing away. Transforming agents must play changes, and with an inventiveness akin to improvisation. But this proves difficult when the catastrophe again cannot be ignored. In the roar of rediscovered suffering, the grand enclosures beckon — America, barbarism, capitalism, civilization, communism, Europe, freedom, patriarchy, socialism, white supremacy, and from several sides – “the West.” Strike those chords, listen and look, but push past too, conversing with all that moves, including movements. The cartoon will always be televised.</p>
<p>— John Lysaker, Atlanta, GA (May 22, 2020)</p>
<p>How does an active ethnographer deal with immobility? Not very well. Sheltering in place seems like prison. Why is it so difficult to concentrate and write during what some would see as an experiment in semi-quarantine? I think of Nelson Mandela, who managed to define a model for the coming democratic South Africa while he was in prison. Or Anne Frank, who wrote her diary in an attic hiding from Nazi police. Never have I felt more totally useless. Eventually, we accept our stripped-down selves. The epidemic is us. Yet we know that we are the privileged ones. Our complaints are pitiful. We miss our favorite restaurants and cafes in the “gourmet ghetto” of North Berkeley. “I got a large can of pinto beans and a box of oatmeal,” my husband said of his morning hunt at the local grocery store. “I had two cans of pinto beans, but I gave one to the woman behind me with three little children.” Later I snuck out to the same grocery store, mask in place and six-foot space behind the handmade chalked lines. But truth be told, I joined the waiting line without looking for anything except to be next to people. The shops still hang signs that announce “Closed Until April 7” — although it is May 28 and no one is there. While sitting in Berkeley’s former junkyard, now the restored and beautiful César Chávez Park, the rain had stopped and the sky opened to a brilliant blue sky amidst a few fluffy white clouds so close one could almost touch them. The air was so clean I could taste its sweetness. With most cars and trucks off the road, the lungs of the air are recovering and the earth is sleeping.</p>
<p>— Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Berkeley, CA (June 4, 2020)</p>
<p>Feminist theory and praxis urges us to resist the impulse to make universalizing statements, with intersectionality in particular calling attention to the costs of homogenizing tendencies when identity is mobilized to make political demands. Drawing on intersectionality, I proceed by juxtaposition to highlight and hold identity and legibility in productive tension: the universalizing narrative of the novel coronavirus, which states that viruses don’t see race or class; the brutal reality that Covid-19 deaths disproportionately affect black people, with one in 2000 dying from the disease. Uprisings in Minneapolis and the spectacle of a burning police station on loop; images of white militias armed and on the steps of the governor’s mansion in St. Paul while heeding calls to “liberate Minnesota” from a shutdown instituted in the name of public health. The NYPD distributing masks to white park goers in the East Village; an NYPD plainclothes officer crouching with his knee in the neck of a black man in the East Village who was allegedly violating social distancing orders. The 7 p.m. clapping to thank essential workers performed by those who are presumably non-essential and home-bound; the absence of communal mourning and rituals for the 100,000 people who have died. Alarm over growing unemployment; the realization that people collecting unemployment insurance and pandemic relief are finally able to afford their daily living expenses. Parents taking to social media to lament the lack of childcare and underscore the ways the pandemic affects their careers and daily lives; families packed into crowded apartments in the Bronx due to exorbitant rents and the rapid spread of Covid-19 in those communities as a result. The use of tear gas against people taking to the streets in anger and grief for yet another black person choked to death by police. A dog walker on camera, leveraging her identity as a white woman and raising her tone to a frenzied pitch to incite a police response; the circulation of a nine-minute long video documenting the murder of George Floyd by police. This list of observations suggests that the utopian project for left-wing politics to take with respect to identity might be the simple recognition of an insight Audre Lorde offered in 1982: “There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not lead single-issue lives.”</p>
<p>— Zein Murib, New York City (June 4, 2020)</p>
<p>Humanity</p>
<p>To be a human being is to be a porous receptivity, a site of exposure. It is to be formed prior to any awareness that one has been formed — when it is too late to do much to change the conditions of one’s formation — and it is to be exposed to a magnificent wealth of meaning circulating locally and at a distance. It is to be a part of a world, where one’s status as part is key to who one is; where the world, always already existing, is also being reshaped by the shared and overlapping pursuits of the parts; where one can be intimately affected by the slightest things happening at the greatest distance. To be human, in other words, is to be entrusted and exposed to the world, prior to one’s choice. To protect and support that human being, then, is not simply to assert her autonomy as an individual and her capacity to choose, but to build, work on, and cultivate her capacity for receptivity to the goods already circulating in that shared world, and to build, work on, and cultivate the shared world to which she is exposed. It is to support all that empowers and facilitates interaction between part and world, between parts and other parts, and to condemn and oppose the violence, such as that so dramatically on display in the institutionalized violence against black Americans, that renders inevitable exposure to others and the world deadly for some, rather than sustaining. The individualizing political discourse of modernity has impoverished our capacity to see our fundamental receptivity and interdependence, and it has produced a global culture where the fertile connections between us have become occasions for exploitation rather than cooperation. It is up to all of us, individually and collectively, to fight to change that.</p>
<p>— Shannon Hoff, Toronto (June 4, 2020)</p>
<p>The pandemic has made clear the social and political inequalities on which our societies have been built. Those who temporally live in limbo, those who are left place-less but have a few square feet to live together without the proper agency to lead their lives as they determine — that is, refugees — are able to protect themselves neither from the virus nor from the xenophobic/nationalistic discourse and implementation of border closures. Echoing Robin Celikates’s recent description, governments’ decisions to close borders draw parallels between the threat of the virus and the “‘threat’ of ‘uncontrolled’ migration.” The fear of persecution and displacement makes the position of the refugee unique: at best, in a refugee camp, in indefinite limbo; at worst, on the move trying to arrive somewhere/anywhere. While the question of “what we owe refugees” can be broached from multiple perspectives, I will address the one that is currently broadcasted on multiple media: the humanitarian approach. On May 21, 2020, the WHO and the UNHCR announced that they are to join forces under the “COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund” to “improve health services for refugees, displaced, and stateless people.” The heightened risk of refugees living in the camps is well documented. Moreover, in one of their recent publications, the UN provided an animation to draw attention to “the need for moral support” of the refugees, underscoring the moral wrongness of discrimination and profiling. Such important and powerful rhetoric aims not only at increasing the amount of donation for relief, but also at raising consciousness — at building solidarity. While necessary, I believe that the humanitarian approach is not sufficient for the latter. The recognition of the humanity — thus, the dignity — of the refugee is paramount to the recognition of the refugee’s agency. In turn, such agency is crucial in building solidarity and addressing the refugee’s claim to what Arendt called a “right to have rights.” Concretely speaking, the focus on the “need” of medical care should shift to the “right” to such care, so that those who are left without a polity can recover their sense of self that is intimately tied to the possibility of having a future.</p>
<p>— Yasemin Sari, Cedar Falls, IA (June 9, 2020)</p>
<p>The challenge of internationalism: How can we begin to think about what international solidarity requires in the context of the coronavirus pandemic when all around the world, people are advised to practice “social distancing” from each other and encouraged to perceive in strangers and loved ones alike potential sources of disease and ruin? When energy, resources, and care are primarily devoted, albeit differentially, to the health of the national body politic — understood as a limited “population” with discernible borders to be defended? In this context, can the question of international solidarity even begin to resonate? One thing is clear: Although this pandemic has exposed the interconnected vulnerability of “humanity” as a species, the predominant response, governmental and otherwise, has been the attempt to practice care and solidarity nationally. From the perspective of internationalism, another response to this situation could be to underscore how, to the extent that viruses affect the human body — moving from one to the other without respect to nationality — efforts to ensure national immunities are in vain. There can be no American, Turkish, British, or Indian immunity to this virus or the next one, as the claim to quarantine, vaccinate, or forever ban transnational encounters is belied by human and non-human travel alike. In this sense, the health of any human body and the environment in which that body lives are concerns of everyone, such that the lack of decent public health care in one place jeopardizes the wellbeing of the entire species. However, “humanity” is not equally exposed to the social, economic, and political risks pandemics create and exasperate — bodies are cared for or abandoned to die differentially in gendered and racialized ways across class lines. This is one reason why in imagining what international solidarity requires in practice today, we may need to act not only against the grain of the nation, but also think against humanity as a concept that erases from view crucial political divides and unbearable inequalities within and among species.</p>
<p>— Ayça Çubukçu, Istanbul/London (May 15, 2020)</p>
<p>Recognizing that the virus spills indifferently across national borders but prejudicially harms the marginalized — for social, not biological, reasons — Ayça Çubukçu calls for internationalism but not humanism, insofar as “humanity” is “a concept that erases from view crucial political divides and unbearable inequalities within and among species.” But as a scholar in the humanities, I wonder whether in this global pandemic we can do without the idea of “humanity” to guide current responses and future plans. The pandemic threatens more than human bodies; it is befalling and transforming the whole human world, and humanity isn’t just a conglomeration of subgroups — nations, ethnicities, races, classes, genders — whose only ultimate commonality is biological species. We are the species with an idea of itself — an idea not fixed or given, but both revealed and constituted by how we represent and understand ourselves in and through art and literature and philosophy. I believe we can only fully grasp what is happening and imagine and prepare for “the After” (as a friend put it) if we read the world against the deep background of “the human” that comes into view through our cultural traditions. The humanities present the human to us as image, not just concept, “containing multitudes” but still referring to something shared and precious for which we collectively bear responsibility. In her essay “Human Personality,” Simone Weil writes, “there are words which possess, in themselves, when properly used, a virtue which illumines and lifts up toward the good.” She includes truth and justice; I would add human — but the meanings of these terms are not determined, not owned by any class or race, and only come into view through our stories and groping theories. Might one essential condition for imagining and sustaining a better — more human — “After” be humanistic education in the long and tangled tapestry of reflections, theoretical and artistic, on our aspirations and our limits?</p>
<p>— Lindsay Atnip, Chicago (May 22, 2020)</p>
<p>To be “human, and nothing but human,” according to Hannah Arendt, is to be in a state of the “greatest danger.” Humanity is a source of vulnerability rather than a place of protection. Humans are what stateless persons and refugees are reduced to after they have lost the all-important right of membership within a nation-state. For Arendt, it is better to be a citizen than a human: Citizens can claim belonging and protection from a state. Humans are disposable. With the global spread of Covid-19, the distinction between the human and the citizen has disintegrated well beyond Arendt’s stark framework. In the coronavirus accounting, superfluousness has become the norm for citizens and non-citizens alike. Hundreds of thousands of dead and dying citizens have become daily data points, contested or ignored by other citizens rallying for their liberty and freedom to move. Black and Latino people, for whom the virus has been twice as deadly, have been anonymized and cast aside by their own governments. Millions of workers have lost their jobs, left to navigate crashed unemployment websites, and long lines for food. Global supply chains with crates of PPE favor powerful elites — or just individuals online with credit cards — over the dire needs of specific nations. In a world in which citizens can be expended without actually being expelled, it is difficult to think of the citizen and human as antipodes, or of citizenship and nationalism as a great buffer against economic and social deprivation. Citizenship may provide political rights, but a right to membership in a national community does not provide bedrock against economic inequity. Perhaps it is here, in a focus on the shared states of economic and social deprivation, that we might restore something like unity across peoples and nations. We should, therefore, put aside Arendt’s pragmatic division in exchange for a campaign that focuses on economic equality and on the institutions — national and international — that might foster it.</p>

<p>Quarantine time: For the last several years, I have been working on an oral history project about the migration of Central American children to the United States, and also finishing a novel on a similar subject. During these two months of quarantine, which made live interviews impossible but also allowed for more time at home to read, inquire, and reflect more deeply, I have been thinking about underlying — often unseen — larger migrations, connections, and hybridities. I’ve been contemplating the familiar but unknown (to me at least) Latin alphabet I use every day to write and read in English. I’ve been inquiring in this manner because I am curious how this set of signs, and the very idea of an alphabet, came about through a long and complex migration. I suppose I always sensed, perhaps based on my own mixed ancestry, that the migration of human beings and the resultant exchange of knowledge, information, technology, DNA, and stories — for old and newer myths also traveled across the ancient world to appear in various guises and retellings in slightly altered versions — enhanced one another, influenced each other, built on and metamorphosed what had come before, across space and differences of language and religion and states, and across time. The stories of our species are in many ways a long history of migration, narration, adaptation, and syncretism. I write this very paragraph in the old signs first adapted for a West Semitic language and altered for another thousand-plus years in one and then another Indo-European language, evolving over time and in space, all of it taking place thousands of miles from the country I hold citizenship in, signs I employ for this and other purposes, not least of which is thinking about how the alphabet made possible, via its comparative ease of instruction and dissemination, an increased and widespread literacy and all that entails (a much longer story than this paragraph), because of something still magical, strange, and striking: using black marks in the Baskerville serif typeface (my favorite, designed in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century) to record the sounds of language, shareable in silence, inside individual minds, as the marks are read and make meanings.</p>

<p>The street peddler watched the prime minister’s speech on a battered TV, with her family of five crowded around her in a one-room house with no toilet and no running water. It’s squeezed into a Mumbai shantytown controlled by an obscure Mumbai organized crime family.</p>
<p>Mina Jakhawadiya knew that outside, somewhere in India, the coronavirus had arrived, wending its way through this sprawling nation of 1.3 billion people. But the invisible danger seemed far away.</p>
<p>Then suddenly it wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Every state, every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown” for three weeks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the nation on March 24, giving India four hours’ notice to prepare. “If you can’t handle these 21 days, this country and your family will go back 21 years.”</p>
<p>As governments around the world try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, India has launched one of the most draconian social experiments in human history, locking down its entire population &ndash; including about 176 million people who struggle to survive on $1.90 a day or less. Modi’s order allows Indians out of their homes only to buy food, medicine or other essentials. No going to work. No school. No playgrounds.</p>
<p>India’s handling of the lockdown and the ever-spreading virus is a test for the developing world, offering clues to how countries from Bangladesh to Nigeria can fight COVID-19 without forcing their poorest citizens into even worse hunger and further destitution.</p>
<p>While India’s economy has boomed over the past two decades, pulling vast numbers out of extreme poverty, inequality also has grown.</p>
<p>Those near the top can hunker down in gated apartment complexes, watching Bollywood movies on Netflix and ordering food deliveries online. But not Jakhawadiya, who makes a living selling cheap plastic buckets and baskets with her husband on the streets of Mumbai.</p>
<p>For her, the order means 21 days in a 6-by-9-foot room with five people, no work, a couple days of food and the equivalent of about $13 in cash.</p>
<p>She looked at Modi speaking on their little television, spattered with stickers left over the years by one child or another.</p>
<p>“I am so afraid,” she thought.</p>
<hr>
<p>This story was produced with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.</p>
<hr>
<p>March 27</p>
<p>Across India</p>
<p>The reasons for the lockdown are clear.</p>
<p>While India had only 536 confirmed coronavirus cases and 10 deaths when Modi gave his speech, it’s also one of the most crowded places on Earth, a nation where social distancing is impossible for millions. The risk is that it could hopscotch from the Himalayas to South India, ravaging cities and villages. Mumbai, for instance, has a population density of 77,000 people per square mile — nearly three times higher than New York City, which crowding helped turn into one of the world’s deadliest epicenters.</p>
<p>Then there’s India’s medical system. Except for private health care for those who can afford it, the medical system barely functions across wide swathes of the country. Public hospitals, especially outside major cities, often have limited supplies, questionable cleanliness and third-rate doctors.</p>
<p>Very few people have been tested, so the true scale of the outbreak is unknown. If India’s hospital system were overrun by COVID-19 cases, it could collapse in days, leaving untold numbers to die.</p>
<p>As a result, many experts say Modi had to act as he did to buy time to prepare.</p>
<p>The lockdown means India has “probably pushed out the epidemic peak by three to eight weeks,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan, an epidemiologist and economist who directs the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in Washington.</p>
<p>But that logic means little for Indians at the bottom of the economic ladder. For these people — for Jakhawadiya in Mumbai, for a maid walking to her home village in the north, for a watchman bicycling his way across the country — three weeks can be an eternity.</p>
<p>“If they stopped the lockdown for just a few days then I could go into town and earn some money,” said Paresh Talukdar, a beggar who supports a family of five in India’s far northeast state of Assam with food supplies down to almost nothing. “One or two days (of lockdown) would be OK, but 21 days is a very long time.”</p>
<p>Now 60, Talukdar lost his left leg and hand more than 30 years ago in a fight over family land. In normal times, he rides a bus from his tiny village to the nearest city, where there are enough people to make a living begging. Most days bring him about $2.50.</p>
<p>But now there’s no bus to take, and few people out on the streets anyway.</p>
<p>Already, he says, the ever-growing hunger has made it hard to sleep. “Thoughts are always coming into my mind, like: What’s going to happen tomorrow?”</p>
<hr>
<p>March 29</p>
<p>Lucknow, north India</p>
<p>For five days after the lockdown began, in a city in the north Indian plains, the maid wondered what she should do.</p>
<p>Ramshri Verma lives in a shantytown on the fringes of Lucknow, a noisy, chaotic city of nearly 4 million people. On the morning after Modi’s speech, she went to the home where she has worked for the past two years.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what they meant by a ‘lockdown,’” she said.</p>
<p>She knocked. Her employers shouted at her through the closed door.</p>
<p>“They told me to come back after 21 days,” Verma said. They also told her she wouldn’t be paid for those days.</p>
<p>She walked home, stopping at a few small stores. She bought rice, cooking oil, spices and lentils, basic staples for many Indians. That left her with 300 rupees — about $4 — for her, her husband and their two children.</p>
<p>Then the family waited. They don’t own a television, so the children bickered about who could watch videos on their only phone.</p>
<p>By March 29, the family was out of food and there was only one place to go: back to the ancestral village where she and her husband were raised. That morning, with bus and train networks shut down, they joined the swarms of migrants who spilled out of cities to walk, sometimes for hundreds of miles, to their home villages.</p>
<p>It was an epidemiologist’s nightmare - and the last thing India needed as it struggled to stop the coronavirus from spreading. The numbers already were rising with worrying speed, reaching 1,024 cases and 27 deaths.</p>
<p>For Verma, home was some 90 kilometers (55 miles) away in Sanjrabad, a tiny grid of streets surrounded by lush fields of sugarcane.</p>
<p>“There were thousands of people who were walking,” she said. “Along the way I met other people who came from my village and we started to walk together.”</p>
<p>The children were tired. Their feet hurt. They cried.</p>
<p>But she and her husband pushed them on.</p>
<p>Late that night, they reached the edge of Sanjrabad and thought they would go home for dinner. But the village leader came out to stop them.</p>
<p>“’You could be infected with the virus,’” he said, ordering them into quarantine in the village school.</p>
<p>There were no medical checks, and no police to enforce the order. But in the ways of rural India, it’s hard to refuse a village head.</p>
<p>Minutes later, everyone was locked inside.</p>

<p>The balloon seller just couldn’t get used to the lockdown.</p>
<p>“There is a strange stillness in our neighborhood since all this started,” said Rajesh Dhaikar.</p>
<p>Normally, he has a small stall in a nearby market, selling plastic bursts of red and blue and yellow one at a time, and rarely earning more than $2.50 a day. His wife, Suneeta, makes about $20 a month cleaning homes.</p>
<p>They have two rooms with a thatch roof covered with a blue tarpaulin. In the rainy season, water seeps in. The single light dangles from a cord.</p>
<p>Suneeta sleeps on the only bed. The five kids sleep on the floor lined up under blankets. Rajesh sometimes sleeps on the sidewalk out front, stretched out on a cart handmade from wooden planks and bicycle tires.</p>
<p>They have a bank account — with about $6.50 in it.</p>
<p>Nearly half the family’s income comes from their 17-year-old son Deepak, a thin, wiry boy with carefully combed hair and a teenager’s bored slouch. He dropped out of school after 7th grade and now makes about $40 a month working in a neighborhood tea stall. One day, he says, he’ll have his own stall.</p>
<p>When he can, Deepak slips outside to play cricket with friends. They scatter when the police come by, then return to their match a few minutes later.</p>
<p>His mother doesn’t like it. Suneeta doesn’t completely understand coronavirus, but she knows getting near other people can kill you.</p>
<p>“What else do you expect from a 17-year-old? He doesn’t listen to anyone and does whatever he wants,” she said.</p>
<hr>
<p>April 3</p>
<p>Along Highway 48, western India</p>
<p>The watchman confronted the lockdown by buying a bicycle.</p>
<p>A skinny, soft-spoken 30-year-old with a carefully trimmed beard, Mohammed Arif was working as a guard at a Mumbai apartment building when he got a call on April 1. His 60-year-old father had suffered a brain hemorrhage, and was battling for his life in a hospital in Rajouri, a small town in the Himalayan foothills of Kashmir.</p>
<p>By then the lockdown had begun. Buses and trains sat idle. Flights had been cancelled, though he couldn’t have afforded a ticket anyway.</p>
<p>So Arif bought a Hero Ranger bicycle with fading purple paint from a fellow guard for about $8, and set off the next morning with the equivalent of $12 in his pocket and a small rucksack with clothes, a loaf of bread and a water bottle.</p>
<p>His destination was 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers) away.</p>
<p>“What choice do I have?” Arif said in a phone call at the end of his first day, when he still had more than 2,000 kilometers to go. “He has no one else.”</p>
<p>“Poor people suffer always and face tribulations. There’s no escape,” he said. “But at least my conscience is clear.”</p>
<p>Repeatedly, Arif stumbled onto people who helped him. In one town, a man running a tiny tire-repair shop offered him chicken and rice. A couple days later, a truck driver shared his lunch.</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises: the police. The Indian poor often fear the police, who regularly demand bribes and beat people with their bamboo staffs. But while police stopped Arif a few times, they always let him pass once he told his story.</p>
<p>He sleeps near gas stations, because they are well lit, or at closed roadside restaurants. Sometimes, he stops when he simply can go no further.</p>
<p>“I reached a highway village last night and wanted to rest there until dawn. But the villagers told me to go away,” he said in one early morning phone call. “They said people might harm me, or even kill me.”</p>
<p>He quickly left and kept pedaling until he reached a small forest.</p>
<p>“I stopped and I’m now waiting for sunrise,” he said.</p>
<p>A few days later, luck won out. After 450 kilometers (300 miles) of cycling, India’s paramilitary police picked him up and, in a public relations display, arranged trucks to take him to the hospital where they were transferring his father.</p>
<p>He brought the bicycle with him.</p>
<hr>
<p>April 6</p>
<p>Sanjrabad, north India</p>
<p>For three days, Ramshri Verma and the other migrants remained locked in the school in her ancestral village. Local officials brought them nothing. The group begged passersby for food and water.</p>
<p>Finally, a team of doctors escorted by police opened the school’s doors. The doctors stood well back, talking to the group from a distance.</p>
<p>For Verma and her family, quarantine was over.</p>
<p>The doctors didn’t check anyone’s temperatures or run any tests. “They only told us that we should wash our hands and then we were told to go home,” she said.</p>
<p>The maid and her family moved into her father in-law’s house.</p>
<p>At first it felt like being released from prison, but it quickly became clear things wouldn’t be much easier.</p>
<p>Because they weren’t registered in the village, they were not eligible for the food rations that local officials were occasionally distributing for the poor. They are surviving on handouts from family of flour and rice, and a few dollars her husband earned working as a laborer for a couple of days.</p>
<p>The neighbors avoid them, especially when they walk to the communal tap to get water, fearing they carry coronavirus.</p>
<p>She keeps her children at home. When they aren’t watching phone videos, they join her on the roof.</p>
<p>“We can see a lot of things from the roof: cows, goats, buffaloes,” said Verma.</p>
<p>The children also watch the village kids play. But they never join in.</p>
<hr>
<p>April 10</p>
<p>Mumbai, western India</p>
<p>Things were growing tense in the Jakhawadiya house. So many days locked together in a tiny space. So little to do. They watched TV — state television was rebroadcasting The Ramayana, an iconic, 78-episode series based on the Hindu epic that was wildly popular in the 1980s — but that eats up only so much time.</p>
<p>The gangsters who run the neighborhood had come by a few times for their $65 monthly rent, which was due on April 1. But the family didn’t have the money.</p>
<p>Mina Jakhawadiya was worried. The family was hungry, though aid groups were distributing enough food every few days to keep the worst hunger at bay.</p>
<p>“I know we are facing bad days ahead,” said Jakhawadiya, a fierce-eyed 47-year-old woman who, like many in India’s vast slums, is a force of will. She knew how to arrange for a daughter’s heart surgery and can feed her family on her minuscule profits. But she’s never faced anything like this.</p>
<p>When things grew especially difficult, it was her quiet husband, Ramesh, who defused the tension, joking and roughhousing with the kids.</p>
<p>“I saw him laughing today,” Mina said in early April, clearly surprised. “The kids were laughing too. I felt really good inside but I have this perpetual fear of what might happen next. Today we have a roof to sleep under, but what if tomorrow we’re evicted? What if we have no food?”</p>
<p>She refuses to watch the news. By April 10, coronavirus cases had reached 7,598, with 226 deaths.</p>
<p>“There is no good news right now,” she said. “All they talk about on the television is people dying.”</p>
<hr>
<p>April 12</p>
<p>Prayagraj, central India</p>
<p>The teenage tea-stall worker, Deepak Dhaikar, was increasingly unhappy.</p>
<p>“The lockdown was not the right decision,” grumbled Deepak, whose friends no longer came out to play cricket. “The rich can survive even if the lockdown stretches for a year, but what will the poor do?</p>
<p>Without even a television, he had started going to bed earlier, and waking up later. One day was blurring into the next.</p>
<p>But sometimes, a 17-year-old who knows the streets can be useful.</p>
<p>When a call came that his grandparents had run out of bread, his mother turned to Deepak.</p>
<p>His grandparents live a few miles (kilometers) away. She gave him a half-kilo (one pound) of flour and sent him out into the streets. He jogged through roads, alleys and fields, dodging police checkpoints or talking his way through them, until he reached his grandparents and delivered the food.</p>
<p>But like Deepak, many in India were growing frustrated as the lockdown stretched on.</p>
<p>On April 10, as cases kept climbing, hundreds of migrant workers desperate to return home took to the streets in the western city of Surat, burning cars. Police arrested at least 80 people.</p>
<p>Two days later, outside a wholesale vegetable market in the north Indian city of Patiala, police stopped a car of Sikh men, who carry swords as a declaration of their faith. When the police refused to let the men in without curfew passes, the Sikhs injured three policemen, chopping off the hand of one.</p>
<p>Across the country, small towns and villages had started closing themselves off, trying to keep the virus away.</p>
<p>“No outsiders allowed,” said a sign on a makeshift barricade in a village north of New Delhi, where groups of men demanded identification from passersby.</p>
<p>An hour’s drive away, in the barricaded village of Siroli, squads of young people were patrolling in search of Muslims, who increasingly were being blamed for the virus after a large spike in cases from a New Delhi meeting of an Islamic group.</p>
<p>“No Muslim is allowed in our village,” said Mohan Kumar, the leader of Siroli.</p>
<p>Such suspicions have threatened to widen religious fault lines that ripped New Delhi just weeks ago, when Hindu mobs attacked Muslims and dozens were killed.</p>
<p>In early April, the government tightened the lockdown in specific areas, using police to seal off neighborhoods with multiple infections, and ordering all stores closed and residents to remain at home. Government workers would deliver food and medicine.</p>
<p>In New Delhi alone, 23 such hot spots were ordered sealed on April 8. But in Deepak’s neighborhood, social distancing still seemed impossible.</p>
<p>“Poor families like ours live in crowded neighborhoods,” he said. “It’s hard to stay away from each other.”</p>
<hr>
<p>April 14</p>
<p>Across India</p>
<p>In the tiny Mumbai house with plastic walls, Jakhawadiya’s family again gathered around the battered television to watch the prime minister.</p>
<p>Three weeks had passed since the lockdown began, and the virus had spread exponentially, from 536 confirmed cases to 11,487. Deaths jumped from 10 to 339. Both numbers, which are widely seen as undercounts, continued to climb.</p>
<p>“You have endured immense suffering to save your country,” Modi told the nation in his speech.</p>
<p>Then he announced the lockdown would continue for two more weeks, though some areas could be reopened next Monday. He gave few details. “It undoubtedly looks costly right now. But measured against the lives of Indian citizens, there is no comparison.”</p>
<p>Modi pleaded for Indians to look out for their neighbors: “Take care of as many poor people as you can.”</p>
<p>Mina Jakhawadiya and her family were stunned. That day, the rent collector had shouted at her and demanded payment. They still had received no government food handouts.</p>
<p>“We will die if people stop giving us food,” she said.</p>
<p>For the poor, hunger had become a worse enemy than COVID-19. People feared the virus — but the larger fear was about simply getting through the next two weeks. And what if the lockdown was extended again?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Mumbai, thousands of migrants and slum-dwellers, furious over the lockdown extension, charged a train station demanding to go home. Police beat them back with bamboo batons.</p>
<p>In Assam, Talukdar, the beggar, was terrified: “Every day we are eating less food,” he said. His family was surviving on a monthly government food ration of 20 kilos (44 pounds) of rice, and meager handouts.</p>
<p>And in Prayagraj, the balloon seller was furious.</p>
<p>“These big leaders take decisions in their big houses!” said Rajesh Dhaikar.</p>
<p>“Did anyone ask the poor what they are eating?”</p>

This week marked the fifth anniversary of a landmark moment in LGBTQ history.</p>
<p>On June 26, 2015 a 5–4 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court upheld same-sex marriage nationwide in a case known as Obergefell v. Hodges.</p>
<p>“As someone who just finished college at the time of the Obergefell ruling, it felt affirming and liberating,” Kingston resident Everal “Ben” Eaton recalled Friday. “It would be in the next few months that I would come out to family and friends as bisexual with all positive responses.”</p>
<p>While members of the community in Northeastern Pennsylvania and around the country have been celebrating that milestone, the anniversary also offered a chance to reflect on rights won, rights not yet won, and the struggle for equality and justice more widely.</p>
<p>“Obergefell was such an unexpected victory for LGBTQ+ couples and families because it came before so many other fundamental civil rights protections,” said John Dawe, 38, a Kingston resident and past chief executive of the NEPA Rainbow Alliance and Equality Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Case in point: It wasn’t until earlier this month that the court ruled 6-3 that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination “because of sex,” includes gay and transgender employees.</p>
<p>And that is just one of many areas in which such protections had been lacking.</p>
<p>“Even though it’s an exciting time for progress, LGBTQ individuals families, and supporters still have much to do to be fully equal,” Dawe said.</p>
<p>Protections still lacking</p>
<p>Indeed, 25 states still have no explicit prohibitions for discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and some loopholes remain.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania still has no comprehensive state anti-discrimination laws based on gender identity or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>But the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to almost all Pennsylvania employers with at least 15 employees.That means people who work for smaller businesses might not be protected. While the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA) covers employers with at least four employees, as well as protections in housing and public accommodations the PHRA does not list sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. In 2018, however, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission released guidance that interpreted sex to include the broader protections.</p>
<p>Formalizing protections in state law has been a contentious issue, with Democrats largely in favor and Republicans — who control both chambers of the state Legislature — largely opposed.</p>
<p>In response, many activists took action at the local level. LGBT rights protections have been passed in 58 municipalities, including Wilkes-Barre and Pittston.</p>
<p>And Gov. Tom Wolf in 2016 signed an executive order banning discrimination against state workers and contractors who are LGBT.</p>
<p>Still, as Dawe pointed out, LGBTQ people are still left in uncomfortable limbo statewide.</p>
<p>“In fact, a same-sex couple could get married on Sunday, post on Facebook wedding pictures, and be evicted from their homes, denied access to a restaurant, and turned away from healthcare as a result,” he said.</p>
<p>Em Maloney, founder of grassroots organization Queer NEPA, stressed that the fight also must embrace people of color.</p>
<p>“The Obergefell ruling made by SCOTUS is definitely a historical landmark, but the fight for change doesn’t end until we have complete LGBTQ equality laws and laws combatting racial injustices that impact the Black community — especially trans people of color,” Maloney said.</p>
<p>Ongoing fears</p>
<p>In addition to protections not yet granted, some fear that opponents of same-sex marriage will continue the fight to reverse Obergefell.</p>
<p>“Marriage equality is still the law of the land and still continues to show positive impact in the community and society However, many worry that the rights will be taken away under different administrations,” said Laurel Run resident Justin Correll, who is a co-founder of the NEPA Pride Project and a NEPA Rainbow Alliance board member.</p>
<p>He sees a re-affirmation of those hard-fought rights in this month’s Supreme Court rulings, and added that the fight to ensure LGBTQ people of color are fully protected remains an ongoing battle.</p>
<p>As people from many races, many religions, and many identities, the community knows what it is to stand up for our inherent worth, one’s identity and to speak out against discrimination, harassment and violence. Countless times people and organizations have organized, agitated and taken action to demand institutional equity and respect for our lives,” Correll said.</p>
<p>“We remember it was Black trans women of color who led the riots at Stonewall, catalyzing a national movement,” he added, referencing the 1969 New York City clash that is seen as the beginning of the modern gay rights movement.</p>
<p>Correll noted that this June — Pride Month — has seen the LGBTQ community joining forces with Black Lives Matter demonstrators.</p>
<p>“Together we are taking action for reform and equality for all,” he said.</p>
<p>Maloney echoed that theme.</p>
<p>“I don’t worry that we’ll lose the right to same-sex marriage, but I do worry about people losing their life because of the color of their skin or for holding the hand of the person they love,” she said.</p>
<p>‘Base it on love’</p>
<p>Gay marriage became legal in Pennsylvania more than a year before Obergefell, when a federal judge in May 2014 ruled that the state’s 1996 ban on recognizing same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>For Tony Brooks, that — and Obergefell — were watershed moments.</p>
<p>“Did I ever think it would happen? No. Not in my lifetime,” the Wilkes-Barre resident recalled Friday. “I didn’t think it would, but I’m certainly glad it did.”</p>
<p>Brooks and husband Matthew were among the first five same-sex couples to apply for a marriage license in Luzerne County. The greeting they received in the Luzerne County Courthouse when they went to fill out the application was, Brooks said, “tremendous.”</p>
<p>“The office applauded us,” he said.</p>
<p>As Brooks noted, he and Mattthew have been together 16 years, married in the eyes of their church for seven years, married by the state for six years and enjoying nationwide recognition of their marriage now for five years.</p>
<p>Brooks believes everyone is entitled to recognition of love and happiness such as he and his husband share, and believes that right is safe as attitudes shift broadly in favor.</p>
<p>“Wherever you are, wherever you live, people have three basic questions they need to address: What do you do? Where do you live? Who do you love?” he said, referring to work, housing and forming families.</p>
<p>“When you base it on love, how are you going to deny that right to anyone?” he asked.</p>
<p>Then, too, Brooks said he takes heart in this month’s Supreme Court decision, in which Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Neil Gorsuch sided with the court’s more liberal wing.</p>
<p>As Brooks said, he looks at the court not as a left-right partisan institution but as a body that often has rendered decisions that fly against prevailing political notions through rulings that have upheld or extended rights.</p>
<p>“I really look at it from the long-range point of view,” he said.</p>
<p>A moment to celebrate</p>
<p>Amid questions of law and justice, for many Obergefell remains a moment to celebrate personal victories.</p>
<p>“I struggled throughout high school and college with my sexuality. I was attracted to both men and women, which was something I would later come to find out was called bisexuality,” Eaton said.</p>
<p>“I remember sitting in my bed at night in tears telling myself, ‘I’m not gay, I’m not gay,’ because I was afraid of what that meant to my friends, to my family, and with my future. Ten years ago, 17- year-old me could not have imagined a future where I could live as openly as I do today,” he said.</p>
<p>“The light is at the end of the tunnel and we have now just taken a couple of steps closer, but we must continue walking, step-by-step, closer.”

1 Land donated to Conservation Easement Fall 2019 c.JPG n 2019, the Franciscan Sisters of Rochester, Minnesota, chose to donate 72 acres of property for conservation easement, to help counteract the way so much land is &ldquo;built up&rdquo; or contaminated by human interference and waste. (Franciscan Sisters of Rochester, Minnesota)</p>
<p>Editor&rsquo;s note: Would you like to be a part of The Life? We&rsquo;re collecting applications for our next round of sister panelists to answer questions about how sisters approach aspects of religious life and other things. Read about how to apply. The deadline is Sept. 15.</p>
<p>In honor of the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, celebrated April 22, 1970, our panelists shared many of the strategies and concrete steps their congregations are using to promote sustainability, preserve a healthy environment and combat climate change in their responses to the following prompt: Describe some ways your congregation is calling its members to sustainability in light of climate change. ______ Mary John Mananzan is a Missionary Benedictine sister from the Philippines. A noted theologian and author, she has served as president of St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College, as prioress of the Missionary Benedictine Sisters in the Manila Priory, and as national chairperson of the Association of Major Religious Superiors in the Philippines. She is a political and feminist activist who helped develop an Asian feminist theology of liberation and works with a number of organizations that deal with gender issues and women&rsquo;s concerns. Currently, she ministers as superior of the Manila community and as a member of the Priory Council. My congregation has been very environmentally active since the &rsquo;70s, when we sisters, while protesting a nuclear plant, joined the die-ins with women belonging to militant organizations, lying down on the street in our white habits, with a banner: &ldquo;Over our dead bodies!&rdquo; Our ecological advocacy became a congregation-wide commitment when our general chapter of 1994 declared that care for the Earth is &ldquo;part of our Benedictine way of life and tradition&rdquo; and mandated that we study the ecological crisis and its effect on people we served, tracing the links to women and children, poverty, justice and peace, and determine concrete actions to care for the earth.</p>

<p>The general chapter of 2012 made environmental protection the focus of our apostolate for the next six years. Our Manila Priory took this mandate very seriously. The Peace, Justice and Integrity of Creation Desk personnel went to all 21 houses to give ecological-consciousness seminars to our sisters and their lay partners in schools, hospitals and pastoral apostolates. Most of our houses have acquired a farm where we do organic biodiverse farming and where our students undertake tree planting activities. We have 10 schools all over the Philippines. In all units of these schools, we incorporate ecological modules, sponsor ecological meetings, encourage our students toward advocacy and activism, launch campus-cleanliness campaigns, adopt ecologically friendly practices like zero-waste management, &ldquo;reduce, recycle and reuse&rdquo; practices, and healthy-food campaigns; plant trees, establish environmental committees, and encourage simplicity of lifestyle. Our building construction follows green principles, which provide for water-collecting systems and solar energy frames. Our sisters are active in their support of environmental struggles, especially against logging and mining. They are in solidarity with indigenous people defending their ancestral lands against multinational mining companies.</p>

<p>Lately, we supported the Manilakbayan, a walk of 1,000 kilometers by the Lumads, indigenous people of Mindanao, to protest the killing of their leaders and the closing of their schools by the military protecting the multinational mining industries. I featured them in my TV talk show, &ldquo;Nunsense Makes Sense,&rdquo; and held press conferences for them. We provided their camps with food and water during their three-week stay in Manila. We took part in the massive environmental campaign on the occasion of the global climate summit in Paris on Nov. 29, 2015, and we do the yearly Walk for the Earth organized by the church. We walk, we partner with environmental groups, but for us, ecological commitment is not only advocacy, but a way of life, so we conform our personal lives to good ecological practice.</p>

<p>Dawn Nothwehr is a Franciscan Sister of Rochester, Minnesota. She has taught religious studies at several universities in the Midwest and since 1999 has held academic appointments at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, where she currently holds an endowed chair in Catholic theological ethics in the Department of Historical and Doctrinal Studies. She is a prolific writer and speaker, publishi ng in peer-reviewed journals, blogs, book reviews, online posts and media. Creation care is in the DNA of the charism of the Sisters of St. Francis of Rochester and a passion we have expressed publicly for some 50 years. In supporting the 2010 resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations that access to clean water and sanitation is a human right, we educate, advocate and unite with others on this issue.</p>
<p>Beehives became a permanent fixture at our motherhouse in 2000 and provide us with honey and wax. Our vegetable garden, flower beds, prairie grass plots and flowering bushes provide the bees with forage while beautifying the environment and removing carbon dioxide, and we educate people about the many dangers bees face today. Since the fall of 2013, 600 solar panels have graced our property — the largest solar field in southeastern Minnesota. At peak performance, it generates 150 kilowatts of electricity per day, the amount of energy needed by about 21 homes. A &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; electricity source: We reduce the need for fossil fuels, and the rebate we received from Rochester Public Utilities covered one-third of the cost, giving us a payback period of about six years. The system&rsquo;s life expectancy is 30 to 40 years, with little, if any, maintenance, even at temperatures from -40 Fahrenheit degrees to 185 degrees Fahrenheit. Our solar field is also an occasion for sustainability education through coverage by various media. In today&rsquo;s technocracy, there is precious little land that is not &ldquo;built up&rdquo; or contaminated by human waste. So to deepen awareness of and contribute to the physical, mental and spiritual health of all by safeguarding fresh air, water, natural beauty and ecological interaction with animals, plants and trees, in 2019, we chose to set aside 72 acres of our property in a conservation easement that will be protected in perpetuity. On Jan. 16, 2020, our sisters were publicly recognized [by Rochester Public Utilities] for &ldquo;short and long range plans and practices for the care and preservation of the land, trees, and water at Assisi Heights based on the mission of the Rochester Franciscans, &lsquo;reverence for creation.&rsquo; The range of their activities includes eradicating buckthorn, eliminating garlic mustard [both non-native invasive species], care for honey bees, restoring trees, planting annuals in the spring to beautify the landscape, developing a butterfly garden as well as strategically caring for the prairie area.&rdquo; In his &ldquo;Canticle of the Creatures,&rdquo; St. Francis of Assisi praised God with Brother Sun, Sister Moon, Brother Fire, Sister Water and Our Sister, Mother Earth: &ldquo;Laudato Si&rsquo;, mi Signore!&rdquo; This canticle is our moral compass and reverential stance, globally and locally, praising God with creation.</p>

<p>Monica Nyachowe is a Dominican sister from Zimbabwe. She has more than 20 years of experience in teaching and administration of schools at various levels, including as school head of the Dominican Convent School in Harare. Her academic work included early childhood education, educational leadership, management and policy. She moved into university teaching in educational studies and currently teaches at Arrupe Jesuit University in leadership and governance. The world as we know is changing rapidly. We humans are always playing catch-up. My congregation has concretely made efforts in a number of our general and regional chapters to write a statement about care for the Earth in our vision statement. Below is an excerpt from one of our chapter acts: We live Gospel values faithfully</p>
<p>And take risks,</p>
<p>As we challenge</p>
<p>Abuse of power, materialism and individualism</p>
<p>In ourselves and others.</p>
<p>We make efforts to honour and care for the Earth,</p>
<p>To alleviate poverty,</p>
<p>And to promote all that supports life. With our desire to honor and care for the Earth, our communities have tried to consciously do something that promotes care for the Earth. Collectively, we have been encouraged to &ldquo;go green&rdquo; in our local communities. Most of our communities have a garden to help grow our own organic foods rather than buying everything, especially excluding genetically modified foods. In addition, many sisters who want to eat healthy foods that have not been processed have been changing their diets to include, for example, brown (zviyo) rapoko porridge and brown rice. In some communities that have a campus or grounds, trees have been planted to absorb the carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change. Most of them are fruit trees, which also contribute to a healthy diet. To reduce the use of fossil fuels, we have also been asked to ensure that we use solar energy where possible. This is being implemented in a few communities, but mostly in hospitals and our retirement home. Most of our schools also are working to have solar put in place. One of our schools has sent students into the streets of the city to clean them of all refuse and rubbish on a big scale. A sister in our community who works in the media field is planning a video program in a slum area of Harare in collaboration with some schools there to instill in these young people the necessity of keeping our planet clean. Most of us want to care for the Earth and have the commitment to do so, but sometimes, we do things unconsciously and forget to maintain our collective efforts to care for the Earth. But it helps to be in community where there is always someone to remind us.</p>

<p>Jantana Wongsankakorn, an Ursuline Sister of Thailand, worked in the financial sector for 10 years. Inspired by the simplicity of religious life, she joined the congregation in Bangkok. After biblical studies in India, Mandarin courses in Taiwan and a tertianship in Rome, she ministered as a catechist and a member of the national chaplain team and then as a missionary in Cambodia. Currently, she is a member of an Asian Pacific chaplain team and teaches mathematics at the Ursuline school in Bangkok. (<a href="mailto:jwursuline@gmail.com">jwursuline@gmail.com</a>) Sixty years ago, the Ursulines in Thailand bought 5 hectares [about 12 acres] of land 20 miles from the city center of Bangkok to use for education ministry. The land is lower than the surrounding area and floods at least two months every year in the rainy season. About 35 years later, the Ursulines and Jesuits developed it as a retreat center for youth and city people who seek a place for quiet and solitude and named it &ldquo;Santiwana,&rdquo; which translates to &ldquo;peaceful wood.&rdquo; Two years ago, the center director, Jesuit Fr. Vichai Phoktavi, became ill. Trying to find a way to make the empty center useful, we considered several questions: How does this relate to the needs of the next generation, particularly city people? How should we care for our common home, in the spirit of &ldquo;Laudato Si&rsquo;: on Care of our Common Home?&rdquo; We found a nongovernmental organization, Media Center for Development Foundation, with agricultural expertise, and using our land and their knowledge, we developed the place into an eco-community. The vision of this project is: &ldquo;Living in harmony with nature in sustainable community with a spirit of love, sharing and sacrifice for our common home.&rdquo; Its mission is to: Restore and maintain the integrity of the ecosystem there, including soil, water and biodiversity of plants and trees, small and large animals like birds, insects, butterflies and fish;</p>
<p>Create habitats and produce food, medicine and clothing by planting rice, vegetables, herbs, fruits, mushrooms; raising ducks, chickens, goats, and fish; and processing and preserving food for consumption and sharing with the needy;</p>
<p>Use innovative technology that is safe and friendly to people and the environment to produce compost, manure, earthworm fertilizer, charcoal and bioactivated carbon for agriculture, and use wind and solar cells to generate electricity in the community;</p>
<p>Build a learning center to provide young people with ecological experiences: for example, the use of a solar pump or bicycle pump for watering; building a mud house, straw house, bamboo house, and a house from waste materials such as glass bottles, logs, or recycled paper; and</p>
<p>Organize educational activities like lectures and workshops, an eco-camp and short courses in organic agriculture, food processing and natural product processing, alternative energy and waste management. We hope this project will be an instrument of God, helpful to the environment by raising awareness and concern about waste and pollution for city people, especially the young. The Santiwana eco-community was begun last year. Though we have few younger sisters, we are confident that with networking, we can do something for our mother Earth, our common home.</p>

<p>Mary Ann Flannery is a Sister of Charity of Cincinnati, Ohio, who has held teaching and administrative positions at several colleges. Before her community, Vincentian Sisters of Charity, merged with the Sisters of Charity, she served as community president and in other leadership roles. She has been a freelance journalist, the director of a Jesuit retreat house, and active in social justice issues for more than 30 years. She continues to offer retreats and spiritual direction. When the late Sr. Paula Gonzalez, a Sister of Charity of Cincinnati, saw the 1972 picture of our beautiful Earth from space, she closed her biology textbook and began a new career as an advocate for Earth and a pioneer leading religious communities and others to a greater awareness of what needs to be done to save our Earth. In 1991, she founded Earth Connection on our motherhouse property, remodeling a large empty garage with recycled wood, furniture, carpeting and an entire wall of recycled aluminum cans and installing a photovoltaic solar panel heating system. Here, facilities coordinator and master gardener Sr. Winifred Brubach provides lectures and workshops, and oversees a large organic garden that could qualify as a mini-farm. (Since 2005, it has supplied an estimated 15,000 pounds of fresh vegetables to struggling families of Price Hill.)</p>
<p>Program Director Sr. Caroljean Willie uses experience gained in representing the Sisters of Charity Federation at the United Nations. She designs interfaith and intercultural programs for environmental studies teachers and religious, civic and business groups and Earth-related spirituality and theology programs. Her global travels showed her how poverty and wealth underlie our treatment of Earth, and she continues to assist developing countries in becoming more ecologically engaged and motivated for a sustainable environment.</p>

<p>Not far from Earth Connection, the entrance to the motherhouse property displays 46.5-kilowatt solar panels, which make a difference in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and in the utility costs of our large campus, providing electricity for two large apartment houses. In two years&rsquo; time, this system saved enough electricity to run an electric car 820,913 miles, burn 101.78 barrels of oil and save 16.3 trees. At the same time, a geothermal heating and cooling system was installed for these homes bringing us to &ldquo;net zero,&rdquo; meaning they operate at the equivalent of zero energy consumed. For six months of the year, our solar panels generate enough energy to meet our needs and put some back into the grid. The first line of Earth Connection&rsquo;s mission statement says, &ldquo;Earth Connection is a center for learning and reflection about living lightly on the Earth.&rdquo; Both Winnie and C.J. remark how much &ldquo;living lightly&rdquo; has meant to them in their own lives and how the example of the congregation&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable ecology adds to the public witness — making this a holy enterprise.</p>

<p>Grace Mary Kenyonga, from Uganda in East Africa, is a member of the Congregation of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, the region of South Africa. In South Africa, she first ministered to adults and children with HIV/AIDS and taught high school religious education and catechism. For two and a half years, she served in a predominantly Muslim area in Senegal, where she worked in the community&rsquo;s clinic for the most marginalized and vulnerable in society. She has recently been missioned back to South Africa. Global warming and environmental degradation have been a serious concern in many countries. Here in our country, we often worry about the number of animal species that will become extinct because of the destruction of their natural habitat. The charism of our congregation includes &ldquo;meeting the needs of the time.&rdquo; In other words, we focus on the specific needs of the area where we are. It may be in the sector of education, health, community empowerment or the like. Since environmental degradation is a worldwide concern, the congregation takes environmental protection as a major concern. Every first Friday of the month, we have a special prayer intention for peace and justice and protection of the environment. In all our regions worldwide, there is someone responsible for the apostolate of peace, justice and environmental protection. In all our ministries — schools, health facilities, orphanages, pastoral work — we endeavor to sensitize the people we work with about the need to protect the environment. We educate them about the dangers of plastic material to the soil and human health and provide dustbins for disposing of plastics to avoid having them going into the soil. Another area of emphasis is to encourage people to plant more trees and practice organic farming to avoid overuse of pesticides. As for my own local community, we plant trees in our compound to take carbon dioxide out of the air. All our vegetable gardens are organic, and we do not use pesticides. We try as much as possible not to use plastic bags for shopping and use paper ones instead — it is the environment that is affected in the long run. In situations where it is unavoidable, we keep the plastic bags for future use. Our communities use water thoughtfully and sparingly. We try to save energy by economizing on power use: for example, any unnecessary lightbulbs are switched off. All this is done to save resources and energy, taking these small steps to help lower global temperatures and do our part to minimize climate change</p>
<p>Maria Magdalena Bennasar (Magda) of the Sisters for Christian Community is from Spain. Studies in theology gave her a foundation for the charism of prayer and ministry of the Word with an emphasis on spirituality and Scripture: teaching, conducting retreats and workshops, creating community and training lay leaders in Australia, the U.S. and Spain. Currently, she is working on ecospirituality and searching for a space to create a center or collaborate with others. To be part of Thomas Berry&rsquo;s Ecozoic era requires the intelligence of an alert heart. Let&rsquo;s stop and listen to the heartbeat of the Earth and, if you are able, bow down to the parcel of earth nearest to you and listen to the Earth&rsquo;s story. It all began millions of years ago, when she was unfolding her beauty in the form of blue oceans and seas, forests and rocks, mountains and green lands, golden deserts and high skies. Millions of species began to emerge and grow. They helped each other to develop in a chain of mutual support. Everything was marvelous when on the sixth day (Genesis 1:26), just before reaching perfection, humankind loomed: the conscious ones called to honor the existing blooming of life and be part of the whole. Like a pandemic virus, we humans exploded. Consciousness was infected by selfishness, and we humans destroyed life. But in the midst of savage fires, we can discover the ecological refugia: islands of green among the ashes, nests for the seeds of life, a metaphor for consecrated life in the 21st century.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-planning-ahead-at-home--abroad">&ldquo;Coronavirus: Planning Ahead At Home &amp; Abroad&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Flagship-Lounge-Bathroom.jpg" alt="img">
Update, March 12th 2020: Given the latest information available, and the shockingly ineffective response by the U.S. government, we are recommending against all but the most essential travel (e.g., if you are a healthcare worker needing to position), and would suggest that everyone able to do so self-isolate or practice social distancing for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>We’ve been receiving dozens of messages a day from readers, clients, and our parents (hi Mom!) asking how the COVID-19 coronavirus is impacting travel. People are understandably worried, and the frenetic news cycle is certainly ratcheting tension over fears of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to put together a general post on the virus and travel for a while, but the combination of what I observed traveling internationally over the weekend and View from the Wing sharing what I’m sure are common coronavirus concerns has pushed me to put everything in one place.</p>
<p>Limiting your exposure doesn’t just mean limiting travel</p>
<p>To start, while I appreciate the questions from people asking if they should avoid traveling to ______ until this blows over, the reality is that our world is too connected for this kind of unpredictable and contagious virus to stay geographically contained.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in the past few weeks, the situation can evolve quickly and unpredictably. While we were all worried about Ben going to China a month ago, a British man spread the virus to at least 11 people from three different countries while skiing in the French Alps.</p>
<p>Given that, it seems unwise to assume that anywhere is “safe” from contagion. Yes, the numbers are higher in certain areas at present (though those could change quickly), and we are all generally more vulnerable when traveling outside our comfort zone.</p>
<p>There may be a choice to be made between traveling at all versus staying local, but unless you were scheduled to fly to a city that is now under quarantine, it’s hard to see how changing a trip to Country A as opposed to Country B really improves your odds when there are so many unknown variables. You’ll still be increasing your odds at airports, and on planes, and anywhere people congregate.</p>
<p>So whether you choose to travel or not, you are likely better off being consistent in taking general precautions and preparing for any eventualities as opposed to throwing a dart and hoping to avoid exposure based on geography.</p>
<p>Wash your damn hands</p>
<p>Seriously. I’ve seen so many people in airports lately wearing paper surgical masks, which is considerate if you have a cold and are trying to prevent the spread of germs, but realistically isn’t terribly effective as a preventative measure.</p>
<p>What does help?</p>
<p>Hygiene. Especially thorough (and frequent) hand-washing, especially when in public spaces.</p>
<p>Shockingly few people actually know how to wash their hands effectively, and even those who do seemingly don’t often take the time to prioritize a proper hand wash when traveling. I’m probably hyper-aware of this, as I have some immunocompromised people in my life, and need to be more careful about what I bring home, and it’s possible I’m over-scrubbing (if that’s a thing).</p>
<p>But there was more than one occasion this weekend where I was washing my hands in an airport sink and someone wearing a mask came into the restroom, did their business, and completed a quick “courtesy rinse” of their hands — all in the time it took me to wash and dry mine.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen this video Jimmy Kimmel did with a Mayo Clinic doctor about how to properly wash your hands, I highly recommend it (also, if you run an airport or airline, maybe consider adding some programming on this topic):</p>
<p>Other ways of limiting your exposure and preventing the spread of germs include:</p>
<p>Avoid touching your face, including biting your nails, or rubbing your eyes</p>
<p>If you do have to cough or sneeze, use a tissue (and immediately discard it, then see above instructions for washing your damn hands), or in a pinch, direct your sneeze/cough into your elbow — “Shark fin!!” as my young nephew reminds anyone in the vicinity with a sniffle</p>
<p>But at a minimum, wash your hands.</p>
<p>Manage your health otherwise (including delaying elective procedures)</p>
<p>Whether you choose to travel internationally or go to your kids’ school play, being proactive about your health in general can lower some of your risk factors. Eating well, getting enough sleep, and managing minor issues seem like small things, but weariness and exhaustion make you more susceptible to all kinds of illnesses.</p>
<p>Call it self care or whatever else, but if you’ve been burning the candle at both ends (something I’m perpetually guilty of), now might be a good time to consider dialing some things back.</p>
<p>Think about your elderly family members and neighbors as well. Are they eating well and keeping up with things, or are they like my grandfather, who would basically eat half a Costco frozen chicken cordon bleu every other day and supplement with coffee?</p>
<p>We’re having some tough conversations in our family. If you live in a building, and your neighbors catch COVID-19, that could make things complicated for everyone — maybe consider having a community meeting, or discussing cleaning protocols with the property manager.</p>
<p>There have been six different treatment protocols in the past six weeks, as scientists and doctors learn more about the virus. There may be six different ones in the next six weeks. But all of them put significant strain on a region’s hospitals, medical equipment, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>So keep up on your vaccines and general healthcare, but also talk to your doctor about if more intense elective procedures can be delayed until summer. Just in case.</p>
<p>Channel your worry into contingency planning and general disaster preparedness</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Dr. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian doctor who is leading the international team for the World Health Organization in China gave this advice on preparedness for other countries (As a sidenote, if you want some very measured and professional insights into the situation, check out the full press conference he gave in Geneva.):</p>
<p>“Number one, think the virus is going to show up tomorrow.”</p>
<p>That’s not intended to be fear-mongering, but rather to inspire thoughtful and solution-oriented planning. The CDC has said it’s a matter of “when, not if” there are “community spread” cases of COVID-19 in the United States — and during any kind of epidemic, the separation is in the preparation.</p>
<p>At the same time, while China may have initially been slow to understand how contagious this coronavirus is (though I’m not an epidemiologist, and can’t speak to if any other country would have done better given the limited initial understanding of the disease), their aggressive response seems to be working to reduce the infection rate.</p>
<p>Extending a national holiday period, ordering schools and businesses closed, mandating who could leave their homes and for what length of time, going door to door to check for symptoms and instituting other measures that could fairly be described as draconian. Not to mention building field hospitals, shifting equipment around, and being able to test tens of thousands of people a day.</p>
<p>I think it’s questionable if the US would be able to respond in the same way if there’s a similar rate of infection. Our health care system is already overwhelmed in many areas, we have a large population of people who don’t have the economic leeway to miss work even if they are sick, and our political system is (intentionally) not conducive to sweeping decrees. As The Atlantic notes:</p>
<p>Except at the nation’s borders, the federal government, with the expertise of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is not in charge. America’s defense against epidemics is divided among 2,684 state, local, and tribal public-health departments. Each one is responsible for monitoring people within its jurisdiction, imposing isolation or quarantine as needed. CDC officials are “preparing as if [the new coronavirus] is the next pandemic,” but in reality, the laboring oar falls to state and local health departments.</p>
<p>And fundamentally, Americans are an unruly and independent bunch.</p>
<p>This is not paranoia, it’s just math. Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch predicts:</p>
<p>Within the coming year, some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-1.</p>
<p>And before people jump in and say “the flu kills way more people!” keep in mind that most of the people who die of the flu have compromised immunity, or aren’t vaccinated. No one is vaccinated against this coronavirus. The average fatality rate for COVID-19 is hovering around 2.3% now; the seasonal flu in the US has a mortality rate of 0.1%, by comparison.</p>
<p>If I look at the numbers in my county (population ~500,000), then even at a 40% infection rate that’s 200,000 people. If let’s say 10% of those infected need hospitalization (and we don’t have good data on what that % would actually be), that’s 20,000 people. There are fewer than 1500 hospital beds in Spokane County, including Children’s Hospitals and rehab facilities. And ~4000 people would die.</p>
<p>Even the “best case” could still put a significant strain on public infrastructure and resources. So you might as well be prepared.</p>
<p>Prep for whatever may happen</p>
<p>The general social expectation in the US is that, in the case of some kind of disaster, you and your neighbors are pretty much on your own for at least an interval of time. The government may eventually show up with water/supplies/shelters/evacuation assistance, but as we see in nearly every hurricane, that isn’t something you should necessarily be relying upon.</p>
<p>So as Gary noted, now is a great time to do the general disaster-preparedness prep that we all should do, but most of us don’t. When I lived in San Diego, we would routinely have power outages, but they never lasted more than a few hours.</p>
<p>The one time we had a significant county-wide outage that created a massive disruption to movement and commerce, we spent it drinking a bottle of tequila on our patio with my husband’s coworkers. That was fun for a day, but would have been problematic after three.</p>
<p>In Spokane, like other cities with more extreme weather, it’s assumed that every n years there will be a significant enough storm to knock out power for a time. And because most neighborhood power lines are above ground, and have lots of old trees, it’s common for it to take 3-10 days for the power to be restored.</p>
<p>View this post on Instagram I truly love winters here. ❄️🌲🏔️ A post shared by Tiffany Funk (@tebfunk) on Jan 19, 2020 at 10:33am PST</p>
<p>So we have a higher level of preparedness here, at least in the winter:</p>
<p>Two to three weeks of drinking water (people often forget water)</p>
<p>Two weeks of less-perishable food (including an extra bag of dog food), and a backup cooking method</p>
<p>We always run our car off the top half of the fuel tank, but in the winter keep it to the top quarter</p>
<p>An extra month’s supply of any medications (mainly the dog in our household)</p>
<p>I’m sure anyone who is into extreme prepping would look at my setup and worry for me, but I’m only trying to make reasonable preparations for a period of isolation and inconvenience, not bury ammo in my yard in anticipation of a general apocalypse. And I feel pretty good about our efforts.</p>
<p>But that’s if I happen to be home. And I am scheduled to leave Saturday for almost a month straight of meetings, conferences, and generally high-personal-interaction travel. So I’m working through the eventualities:</p>
<p>What happens to my household if I end up in a country/city/hotel with an outbreak?</p>
<p>How would I manage being trapped in a quarantine in another location (especially as I have intense food restrictions)?</p>
<p>Which of my meetings can be handled virtually instead?</p>
<p>How can I support my parents and in-laws (who all live elsewhere) in making sure they are ready?</p>
<p>And other such questions. I don’t have answers to all of them yet myself, but I think it’s a better place to focus my energy than changing my destinations based on the confirmed cases map.</p>
<p>Check your travel insurance</p>
<p>As we’re seeing, some airlines are saying they’ll issue fee waivers, others have more restrictive change policies. I expect these will continue to evolve over the coming weeks, but in general it seems you shouldn’t plan on an airline waiving cancelation to anywhere commercial flights are still allowed to operate to. They have commercial concerns and shareholder expectations to manage too.</p>
<p>For future travel (as it’s currently possible to book travel for next winter’s cold and flu season), you may want to look at supplementary travel coverage. Many of the credit cards in the US that offer travel coverage allow you to cancel if you or a family member become ill, but they don’t have clear language on what happens if you are scheduled to visit a place where a quorum of other people are ill.</p>
<p>Similarly, some of the disaster and medical evacuation plans out there won’t transport you if you are the one with an infectious disease.</p>
<p>So read up on all the fine print, and make sure you understand your options.</p>
<p>Bottom line</p>
<p>I think what it comes down to is that worrying about travel plans is the least of the worrying that should be done right now. While we can’t individually do much to keep an asymptomatic flight attendant from working a flight and going to public gatherings in multiple cities, there are still specific and tangible things that can be done in anticipation of eventually being exposed to a highly contagious virus.</p>
<p>It’s reasonable to be concerned about the rapid spread of this coronavirus, but at this point the focus should be less on whether or not you should go “somewhere” and more on what you can do to be prepared “anywhere.”</p>
<p>What, if any, behaviors are you changing due to the coronavirus outbreak?
