<p>Kavita Kaushik has earlier participated in Jhalak Dikhla Jaa. (Photo: Kavita Kaushik/Instagram)</p>
<p>TV actor Kavita Kaushik is all set to enter the Bigg Boss 14 house two weeks after the reality TV show began. She is among the popular faces of the television industry who will be competing for the winner‚Äôs title in the Salman Khan-hosted show. Earlier the actor had refuted reports of her participating in the show.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Kaushik is popular among fans for her role as the tough female cop Chandramukhi Chautala in SAB TV‚Äôs hit sitcom FIR. It was after nine years of essaying the role that she finally bid farewell to it.</p>
<p>Kavita Kaushik, who started her career as a model, made her acting debut with 2003 show Kutumb that had Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan in the lead roles. She went on to play negative roles in Ekta Kapoor‚Äôs hit shows like Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii and Kumkum ‚Äì Ek Pyara Sa Bandhan. Soon after she thought of breaking out of her negative image and this is when she decided to star in FIR.</p>
<p>The actor also tried her hands at reality TV shows as she participated in Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa in 2015. She grabbed headlines after she stormed out of the show‚Äôs finale. She walked out of it after being made fun of on the stage by members of the roast comedy show ‚Äî Comedy Nights Bachao. She even called for a boycott of the show for being disrespectful, rude and offensive.</p>
<p>Though the actor did a few Bollywood movies, she thinks of television as her ‚Äòterritory‚Äô. In an earlier interview with PTI, Kavita Kaushik had shared, ‚ÄúTV is my territory and I am never going to leave it for films. I don‚Äôt keep false dreams. I know no one will cast me opposite Salman or Shahrukh and I am not going to play side roles like sister or bhabhi. Television is where I have made it big, can work on my terms and play meaty roles.‚Äù</p>
<p>On the personal front, Kaushik dated TV actor Karan Grover and even participated in celebrity couple dance show Nach Baliye season three. But the two parted their ways. Now, the actor is married to her best friend Ronnit Biswas. The couple tied the knot in 2017.</p>
<p>Check out a few photos and videos of Kavita Kaushik:</p>
<p>Apart from Kavita Kaushik, the other contestants of Bigg Boss 14 include Nikki Tamboli, Eijaz Khan, Pavitra Punia, Rubina Dilaik, Jasmin Bhasin, Abhinav Shukla, Nishant Singh Malkani, Jaan Kumar Sanu and Rahul Vaidya.</p>

<p>Updated: Oct 24, 2020, 14:23 IST</p>
<p>There has been much conjecture about the Bigg Boss 14 wild card contestants but a new leaked video shows that television actors Kavita Kaushik and Naina Singh will enter the show this weekend. In a new promo for the upcoming Weekend Ka Vaar episode hosted by Salman Khan, the two are seen battling each other in a fierce dance-off.</p>
<p>Naina makes a smashing entry to the song Babuji Zara Dheere Chalo, dressed in a silver strapless dress. Kavita, too, is seen dancing to the same song. She is seen wearing a white long-sleeved dress with a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit. The song then changes to Laila Main Laila, and the two are seen walking towards each other and busting out competing moves.</p>
<p>Kavita has been in the television industry for nearly two decades and is best remembered for playing Inspector Chandramukhi Chautala in the comedy show FIR. Naina, on the other hand, won the dating reality show Splitsvilla 10 in 2017. She was most recently seen as Rhea Mehra in Kumkum Bhagya but quit the show earlier this year.</p>

<p>According to reports, another wild card contestant is set to enter Bigg Boss 14 with Kavita and Naina. However, Colors has kept the identity of the third contestant under wraps for now.</p>
<p>Bigg Boss 14 has been living up to its theme - ‚Äòab scene paltega (the scene will change now)‚Äô. There have been a number of surprises on the show, from the presence of ‚Äòseniors‚Äô Sidharth Shukla, Hina Khan and Gauahar Khan in the Bigg Boss house to contestants having to fight it out for the ‚Äòconfirmed‚Äô status.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the ‚Äòseniors‚Äô exited Bigg Boss 14 after a two-week stint on the show. Two contestants from the show - Sara Gurpal and Shehzad Deol - have been evicted so far.</p>

<p>Kavita Kaushik is a strong-headed personality. Known for playing Inspector Chandramukhi Chautala in Sab TV&rsquo;s show F.I.R, Kavita has proved that she is a &lsquo;boss lady&rsquo; in real life also. She is bold, strong, and wears her hearts on her sleeves. Recently, the actress called out a cyber-bully, who was sending her obscene and vulgar images on her social media handle.</p>
<p>She exposed the online harasser publicly for sharing &lsquo;inappropriate&rsquo; pictures. The actress lashed out at the pervert who slid into her DM&rsquo;s (Direct messages) on her Instagram profile and sent &lsquo;lewd&rsquo; pictures. Kavita not only expressed her angst against such cyber-bullying but also disclosed the man&rsquo;s identity publically, lashing out at him for his indecent and unacceptable behavior. She shared a screenshot of the man&rsquo;s Instagram profile and revealed his name to be Shankar. Kavita shared how he has been sending &lsquo;dirty and filthy&rsquo; images of his private areas during the auspicious festive season of the festive season of Navratri.</p>

<p>The actress also highlighted an important point that if the man in question dares to send indecent pictures to celebrities, he would stoop down to new lows in front of lesser privileged girls. Lastly, she questioned why nobody is offended by such cyberbullies, harassing women.</p>
<p>Kavita tweeted, &lsquo;This man named &lsquo;Shankar&rsquo; is confidentially sending pics of his privates to celebs during this holy time, imagine what a threat he must be to less privileged girls, how is no one offended n bothers to find where he lives and yell slogans!? Saara zor aurton pe hi chalta hai kya?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taking strong action, Kavita then went on to complain against the man. She asked Mumbai Police, Aditya Thackrey, and Cyber Cell department to punish the person as soon as possible. Kavita wrote, &lsquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t be difficult to arrest this man.&rsquo;</p>
