My daughter is making crepes in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The windows are open. A quiet breeze flutters in. The sun reflects off the shiny backs of my bay and black Trakehners in their grassy field behind my house. It’s a peaceful scene, and in any other situation it might be an idyllic holiday in the French countryside.</p>
<p>But that’s not what this is. This is Day 8 of official confinement in France due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government orders just got stricter as of Tuesday (March 24). This isn’t peace. “We’re at war,” President Emmanuel Macron said again and again and again, like a battle drum during his stately speech telling his 70 million citizens that, until further notice, they can’t leave their homes except for the “essentials”—food, mainly, or health care, or “tending to the needs of your companion animals.”</p>
<p>We can’t go out without release papers that state our address, reason for being out, and the time we left home. Police controls are happening everywhere, and first offenses are punished by $US150 fines. As of Tuesday, second offenses carry a fine of $US1,800, and third offenses are punishable by a $US4,200 fine and up to six months in jail.</p>
<p>“Oh, a falcon just landed on the roof of the stables!” my daughter just announced from the kitchen, where her afternoon crepes are perfuming our confinement zone. Her cheerfulness pulls me briefly away from the dreary reality of confinement for French horse owners. And dreary it is—for some. Afterall, would you risk prison and fines to see your horse? What if he’s only a five-minute drive away? What if he’s in an unmanned pasture where you just walk over—or used to, back when we weren’t at war with a microscopic army—every day with carrots, love, and a water hose for refilling tanks from a nearby faucet?</p>
<p>Interpreting Government Decrees</p>
<p>My family is among the lucky ones. We moved to a 16th-century farm with 12 acres in the Loire Valley not even a year ago. We don’t need a paper to go outside for some equine bonding time. We don’t have to wonder if our horses are healthy, if anyone’s colicking, if anyone’s lame, if anyone’s broken through a fence and is running madly through the empty streets. All we have to do is look out the window or slip on boots and walk out the door.</p>
<p>But that’s not the case for everyone. Most French horses—and European horses in general—live in equestrian centers and boarding stables, not with their owners.</p>
<p>At first, Macron’s decree was unclear regarding horses. He said people could go out to take care of the needs of their “companion animals” as long as they stayed “near home.” But vague policies can be disastrous. Few countries, including France, have come to any kind of decision about how to classify horses—as livestock or pets. (In countries where horses can be slaughtered for human consumption that decision is more difficult for authorities to reach.) And what exactly does “near home” mean?</p>
<p>Confusion for Owners, and Authorities</p>
<p>One horse owner in northwestern France recently found out what “near home” means when she was transporting water on a scooter to her horses in their pasture, a quarter mile from home. The police slapped her with a $150 fine and warned her to not go back again. It’s likely that the fine will eventually get canceled (once authorities figure out what a welfare mess this could mean), and the young woman doesn’t intend to stop watering her horses. But it just underlines the fact that in this unprecedented situation, everyone’s confused.</p>
<p>So confused, in fact, that even the French Ministry of Agriculture needed eight days to get responses to my questions about how the confinement applies to horse management. They didn’t ignore me or forget me; they assured they were working on the questions. The thing is, they just didn’t know.</p>
<p>Getting Answers in a Make-the-Rules-as-You-Go World</p>
<p>The French Ministry of Agriculture finally responded this morning. No, people can’t go to their horses if they don’t live at home; they have to be cared for by the boarding stable’s personnel. (How does a staff of one or two people take care of 70 stalled horses?) No, you can’t go riding for exercise (not even in a forest with little pedestrian traffic) unless you stay at home. Yes, they’ll let you make an exception to move your horse to a pasture somewhere to get it out of a stall during confinement, but you’ll need plenty of paperwork to prove where you’re going with your horse and why, and it can’t be for any other reason than his welfare.</p>
<p>It’s strict. In Italy, for example, horse owners can still go out—release paper in hand—to check on their horses in boarding centers and take care of them. But in the end, Italy might not be the best example to follow, with 800 human deaths every 24 hours now despite nearly three weeks in confinement.</p>
<p>Giving Up Riding: The Good Sacrifice</p>
<p>In Spain, where the death toll just topped that of China, riding horses is now against the law until further notice. That seems extreme but, on further thought, it’s not a bad idea. The measure isn’t meant to stop the spread of the virus; that would have little effect. Instead, it’s designed to drop the rate of emergency room visits for anything other than COVID-19. Horseback riding is a known dangerous sport. Not riding is just one more way we riders can help ease the load of health care workers and, possibly, help save a few lives by freeing up doctors to treat COVID-19 patients symptoms instead of our concussions or fractures from some silly fall.</p>
<p>Regardless of a rider’s experience or ability, we’re all at risk, and I’ve decided to implement Spain’s rule in my home: no riding until further notice. I’ve never fallen in my many years of riding, but that doesn’t mean I never will. I’d hate for it to happen now—for me or any of the other family members and friends with whom I’m confined. This doesn’t mean not spending time with the horses, though. That article I wrote back in January—about what to do with your horse when it’s too cold to ride—now has a perfect place in this exceptional spring context as well. We’ll just need to rename it, “The Smart Equestrian’s Guide to Reduced-Risk Quality Time in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era.”</p>
<p>Playing My Part</p>
<p>As a journalist, I hope to help inform—both owners and government authorities—in dealing with this crazy situation that has taken over every aspect of our lives. I hope I can help make sure horses don’t suffer unreasonably because of the human virus pandemic.</p>
<p>As a fellow owner, I hope I can do my part in fighting this war, keeping my animals and my family healthy. I hope I can take three or four more horses on my 12 acres to get them out of a stall somewhere for the rest of the confinement period. I’ll take them all carrots and watch the sun glisten on their backs as the smell of crepes wafts through the open kitchen window–a glimpse of peace in these otherwise seemingly dystopian times.

<h3 id="off-track-fretting-horse-racing-industry-is-hanging-on-by-nose-right-now">Off-track fretting: Horse racing industry is hanging on by nose right now</h3>
<p><img src="https://stmedia.stimg.co/CANTERBURY2.JPG?h=630&amp;w=1200&amp;fit=crop&amp;bg=999&amp;crop=faces" alt="img">
On a normal Saturday, Robertino Diodoro would have been surrounded by at least 20,000 people at Oaklawn Park. Walking from the paddock to the grandstand to the winner’s circle, the horse trainer usually has to navigate a crowd at the Arkansas track, shaking lots of hands along the way.</p>
<p>Since the onslaught of the coronavirus, there have been no normal days. Diodoro now has to fill out a form and have his temperature taken by a paramedic before he can even enter the paddock or grandstand. Last Saturday, with no fans allowed at the track, Diodoro watched in near silence as Nomizar won the eighth race.</p>
<p>“We’re still running at Oaklawn, which has been a lifesaver,” said Diodoro, who has won three training titles at Canterbury Park. “With so many places shut down, it’s been a complete nightmare. I don’t think I’ve ever been this stressed. If it doesn’t turn real quick, there are going to be a lot of people in trouble.”</p>
<p>Horse racing is one of the few sports still running in a country hunkering down to fight COVID-19. Some tracks, such as Oaklawn and California’s Santa Anita, have continued racing in front of grandstands that are closed to the public. Other tracks in places such as Maryland and Ohio have been shuttered completely, and Aqueduct in New York suspended racing after a worker at nearby Belmont Park tested positive.”</p>
<p>Canterbury Park is scheduled to begin live racing May 15, but track President Randy Sampson said it is “highly unlikely” the meet will open on time. The track temporarily closed its card room and on-track simulcast area March 16, a blow to the bottom lines of both Canterbury and its horsemen. With those revenue sources halted indefinitely, less money will be generated for purses, which could cause two or three days to be cut from the 65-day season.</p>
<p>“It’s eerie. I’ll go sit in the grandstand and have a soda, and I’m the only person there. During the race, there’s no crowd noise. In the winner’s circle, there’s nobody there. I’ve never seen anything like it.” Richard Grunder, jockey agent and fill-in Canterbury announcer</p>
<p>For now, Sampson said, he’s confident Canterbury can press on. But he worries about horse owners … ones who are financially strapped and might not be able to afford their animals’ keep. And the trainers who race at Canterbury in the summer, but are now at tracks that have been idled, with nowhere to go. And the jockeys and starting-gate crews who work in close quarters.</p>
<p>“There are no easy answers, and no script to follow,” Sampson said. “It’s a terrible situation, with no end in sight.”</p>
<p>It’s also changing day by day. Diodoro has horses at several tracks, including a large string that was running at Turf Paradise in Phoenix until it shut down March 14. He shipped some of those to Sam Houston Race Park in Texas, only to see it close Sunday.</p>
<p>“I’ve never been so nervous when I see an owner’s phone number come up on my phone,” Diodoro said. “I’m scared they’re going to call me and say they’ve lost their shorts in business, or in the stock market, and they’re going to have to sell their horses. It’s a mess.”</p>
<p>Concern for industry workers</p>
<p>Canterbury’s card club was bustling in January and February. It’s now empty after a voluntary shutdown, and Sampson expects it could stay that way for as long as eight weeks.</p>
<p>The track still plans to pay about $14 million in purses this summer. Approximately half of Canterbury’s purses are funded by supplemental money from its deal with the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, which will not be affected. A percentage of card club and simulcast revenue also goes to purses, and while the stoppage will reduce that, Sampson said the shortfall should be manageable.</p>
<p>“If the shutdown is only a month or so, we can maintain purses by reducing races by two or three days,” Sampson said.</p>
<p>His greater concern lies with the trainers, horse owners, grooms and other people in the industry. Several Canterbury trainers race at Turf Paradise in the winter. When it shut down, it initially told trainers that everyone would have to leave by March 28, stunning those who couldn’t find a place at another track or didn’t have a farm.</p>
<p>Canterbury considered opening its stable area early to accommodate both the horses and the caretakers who live in track dormitories. Turf Paradise now is allowing them to stay, and Canterbury plans to open its barns to horses sometime after May 1. But the eviction notice stoked fears of what could happen if the coronavirus forces complete closures.</p>
<p>“There are concerns about the welfare of the horses, and where they all end up,” said Andrew Offerman, Canterbury’s vice president of racing operations. “When you think about the quantity of horses that are stabled at some of these tracks, there probably aren’t enough farms or facilities to accept those horses, or enough people to provide exercise. That’s a significant thing weighing on our minds.”</p>
<p>State veterinarian Dr. Lynn Hovda said the horses are not at risk for infection, because they don’t get the same coronavirus that humans do. There is risk, though, for people who work with them.</p>
<p>Some jockeys, including stars such as Irad Ortiz Jr., have stopped riding because of concerns about how quickly the coronavirus could spread at the track.</p>
<p>“If there’s a positive test with a jockey, do you have to quarantine the entire jockey colony?” Sampson said. “Then you can’t race. And what happens to a barn, with all the people interacting, if someone gets it? Are they going to quarantine all those people? And who takes care of the horses then?</p>
<p>“There are some really unique challenges for the horse industry. You don’t have the ability to just tell everybody to stay home.”</p>
<p>‘It’s eerie’</p>
<p>Diodoro praised the tracks that are still racing without spectators. He can’t shutter his business, he said, because the horses must be fed, exercised and groomed. By continuing to run, he and his owners at least have a chance to win money to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Still, it’s hardly business as usual. Diodoro said veterinarians and horseshoers also must have their temperatures taken at the stable gate before entering. Richard Grunder, a jockey agent and fill-in track announcer at Canterbury, is calling races at Florida’s Tampa Bay Downs solely for a simulcast audience.</p>
<p>“It’s eerie,” Grunder said. “I’ll go sit in the grandstand and have a soda, and I’m the only person there. During the race, there’s no crowd noise. In the winner’s circle, there’s nobody there. I’ve never seen anything like it.”</p>
<p>With no spectators—and no on-track handle — Grunder said Tampa Bay Downs is losing money by continuing to race. Canterbury is certain to face challenges, too.</p>
<p>Sampson and Offerman have considered how their fields might shrink if cash-starved owners can’t afford to keep horses. If the season is delayed for a longer period, Canterbury might use some purse money to help owners pay expenses. Scott Rake, president of the group that represents Canterbury’s horsemen, said there have been discussions about whether it would be economically feasible to run with no spectators.</p>
<p>“That might be viable for two weekends,’’ Rake said. “All the overhead doesn’t change much, and when you’re not charging admission or capturing that on-track handle, it doesn’t make a lot of sense.’’</p>
<p>Rake said the horsemen want to do their part to keep the races running, in whatever form is possible. Grunder, who has worked at Canterbury for more than three decades, is counting on it.</p>
<p>“I’m really hoping with a little time, [the coronavirus] will level off,” Grunder said. “A summer without racing at Canterbury? I don’t even want to think about it.”

Study receives NSF grant</p>
<p>A researcher from The University of New Mexico is part of a collaborative that is studying one of the most important socio-environmental changes in human history: the dispersal of the domestic horse into the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
<p>Anthropology department associate professor Emily L. Jones is part of the collaboration between the University of Colorado Boulder, UNM, and the University of Oklahoma that has just received a $300,000 National Science Foundation grant to study the spread of horses.</p>
<p>Jones is one of a collaborative team looking at the spread of horses globally. Horse domestication is widely recognized as a key transformative event in human prehistory. The initial domestication of horses has been linked to major changes in human mobility and social organization. Some of the team’s research focusing on the horses of eastern Eurasia was published earlier this year in Nature: Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>Domestic horses revolutionized life across the plains and deserts of western North America, Jones said. Horses made possible long-distance high-speed transport and created some economies based on raiding, a transformation which had profound impacts on societies and environments both.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;re hoping to understand how the great Indigenous ‘horse nations’ of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Apache, Comanche and Lakota, came to be. They were, and are, an integral part of American history, but at this point little is known about the process by which the horse became so central to their cultures,” explained Jones, who is director of the UNM Department of Anthropology’s Zooarchaeology lab as well as director of the Public Archaeology Graduate Program.</p>
<p>“By studying horse remains from archaeological sites dating to the early 16th and 17th centuries, we’ll be able to answer these questions. Our preliminary results suggest horses became an integral part of some Indigenous societies much earlier than has previously been suggested,” she added.</p>
<p>Researchers seeking to understand the complex interactions between present-day environmental and cultural change increasingly turn to historical datasets, which enable examination of such interactions over the long term. This project uses historical and archaeological data to model human responses to the dispersal of the domestic horse into the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>
<p>“We are visiting museums across the American West, here in New Mexico, in Arizona, Wyoming, Montana, California and others to study domestic horse remains from 16th and 17th century archaeological sites. We look at bones to identify changes to those bones that suggest how horses were used by people, for instance, if were they ridden, and if so, with tack or not. Specific changes in the bones can answer these questions for us,” Jones said, noting a photo of a horse mandible with teeth that show signs of wear from a bit, part of riding equipment that goes in a horse’s mouth to control movements.</p>
<p>Some of the collaborating researchers will talk to Indigenous Americans to incorporate their perspectives on the history of horses, Jones said, while others will date the remains using radiocarbon dating and use isotopic analysis to tell them what the horses ate, whether they were &ldquo;foddered,&rdquo; or given supplemental feed by people to get them through the winter months, as well as how they moved across the landscape throughout the year. The information will help produce a scientific model for when and how domestic horses dispersed into the continent, and in so doing explains the ways horses impacted life in early historic America.</p>
<p>Results of the project are to be disseminated through scientific literature, popular media, and a museum exhibit, as well as a series of seminars bringing together scholars and indigenous leaders. In doing so, this project establishes an analytical framework for understanding the complex interaction between species dispersals, environmental changes, ecological factors, and cultural transformations that built the modern world.
