<p>Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:</p>
<p>This Operations Update is issued to inform stakeholders of the need to extend the timeframe of the MDRPH039 Taal Volcano Eruption by one and a half months (end date 15 July 2020).This will enable Philippine Red Cross to complete the provision of multipurpose cash grants to 1,410 families, which has been disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak; and subsequent restrictions being enforced by the Philippine government. Post-distribution monitoring will also be conducted on the cash and items provided.</p>
<p>The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, German, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as DG ECHO and Blizzard Entertainment, Mondelez International Foundation, and Fortive Corporation and other corporate and private donors. The IFRC, on behalf of the Philippine Red Cross, would like to extend thanks to all for their generous contributions.</p>
<p>A. SITUATION ANALYSIS</p>
<p>Description of the disaster</p>
<p>On 12 January 2020, the Department of Science and Technology’s Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) raised an Alert Level from 1 to 4 (out of 5) after increasing activity of Taal Volcano, which is located on the island of Luzon in Batangas, CALABARZON (Region IV-A). An Alert Level 4 means that a hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days, and warrants a “Danger Zone” of up to 14 kilometres from the main crater. Taal Volcano is situated on Volcano Island and is listed as a “Permanent Danger Zone”, with permanent settlement on the island not recommended, however, approximately 459,300 people live within the 14 kilometres Danger Zone (OCHA). Taal Volcano is among the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, with more than 30 reported eruptions. On 12 January, PHIVOLCS reported that eruptive activity at Taal Volcano main crater had intensified, with continuous eruptions generating a 15 kilometres of steam laden cloud of super-heated ash, and frequent volcanic lightning raining wet ashfall as far as Quezon City, some 100 kilometres away. This subsequently progressed to a magmatic eruption accompanied by thunder and more lightning. On the advice of PHIVOLCS, pre-cautionary evacuations were conducted in at-risk communities within the 14km Danger Zone in Batangas and Cavite provinces. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of calamity across CALABARZON, as a means of expediting the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those affected.</p>
<p>According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) situational report as of 6 March 2020, the Taal Volcanic eruptions have had the following impact:</p>
<p>• A total of 736,802 people (191,952 families) have been affected in CALABARZON (Region IV-A), Central Luzon (Region III) and National Capital Region (NCR).</p>
<p>• Families displaced:</p>
<p>o At the peak of the crisis, 135,610 people (39,076 families) were being supported in 535 registered evacuation centres (EC), and 170,732 people (44,439 families) were outside the evacuation centres (ECs) (NDRRMC situational report No. 47).</p>
<p>• Damage to infrastructure:</p>
<p>o 14,082 houses were damaged, of which 4,573 were totally damaged (destroyed); and 9,509 partially in the province of Batangas, CALABARZON (Region IV-A).</p>
<p>• Essential services affected</p>
<p>o Eight public and private health facilities were closed as a result of evacuation.</p>
<p>o 264 cities/municipalities suspended classes, and 78 schools in the 14km zone had to be evacuated, affecting approximately 31,000 children (Department of Education).</p>
<p>o 24 cities/municipalities experienced power interruptions, all of which have now been fully restored.</p>
<p>o Three cities/municipalities experienced water supply disruptions, all of which have now been fully restored.</p>
<p>o Nine roads were closed due to damage caused and as a result of lockdown of areas within the 14km Danger Zone.</p>
<p>o 643 flights cancelled due to ashfall (383 domestic and 260 international).</p>
<p>• Damage caused to infrastructure and livelihoods (farming, fishing and tourism) estimated to be approximately CHF 65 million (NDRRMC).</p>
<p>On 26 January 2020, PHIVOLCS lowered the Alert Level from 4 to 3 as the likelihood towards a hazardous eruption was reduced. On 14 February 2020, this was then lowered from Alert Level 3 to 2 to reflect an overall decreasing volcanic earthquake activity, and steam and gas emissions at the main crater of Taal. On 19 March 2020, the Alert Level was then lowered again from 2 to 1.</p>
<p>Despite the lowering of the Alert Level, PHIVOLCS continued to warn that the unrest had not completely stopped, with the persisting possibility of sudden steam-driven explosions, volcanic earthquakes, and ashfall, which could threaten surrounding areas. They continued to recommend that entry to Taal Volcano Island remain strictly prohibited, and advised Local Government Units (LGU) to continue to strengthen their preparedness, contingency plans and communication measures in the event of renewed volcanic activity. The lowering of the Alert Level allowed thousands of people that had been evacuated to return home, however many remain displaced and in need of resettlement due to the proximity of their places of origin to the volcano.</p>
<p>Taal Volcano eruptions came as authorities and partner organizations in the Philippines have been responding to public health emergencies (measles and polio outbreaks, MDRPH032; dengue outbreak, MDRPH033), earthquake (Mindanao, MDRPH036) and typhoons (Kammuri in November 2019, MDRPH037; Phanfone in December 2019, MDRPH038).</p>
<p>Since January 2020, the country, has also been wrestling with the continuing spread of COVID-19. On 12 March 2020, the Philippine government raised a Code Red sublevel 2 as recommended by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (ITAF-EID). This has imposed stringent measures on the country including measures of physical distancing, enhanced community quarantines, and limitation of movement within the entire country. On 16 March 2020, the entire Luzon was put on enhanced community quarantine until 13 April 2020, which was later extended until 15 May 2020. At the time of publication, a total of 10,343 cases and 685 deaths had been reported by the Department of Health (DOH) COVID-19 Case Tracker. There has been a prioritization of the Philippine government, and partner organizations including Philippine Red Cross (PRC) to prioritize the COVID-19 response. This has had implications on the PRC implementation of other ongoing operations, including the Taal Volcano response, with activities having to be rescheduled or redesigned to adapt to the current situation. A one and a half months extension of timeframe has been approved to accommodate the changes that have been required, and enable commitments to the affected population to be met.

<p>Due to all the chaos of evacuating after the eruption of Taal Volcano in the Philippines in January 2020, it completely slipped my mind that we had to take part in S.U.P.E.R Training.</p>
<p>S.U.P.E.R. Training stands for: “Spiritual Unity &amp; Physical Endurance Reinforcement.” The annual training for the missionaries emphasizes the importance of teamwork, partnership, intimacy with God, patience, a never-give-up attitude and the spirit of obedience.</p>
<p>I had heard so many horrendous rumors about S.U.P.E.R Training, which is why I really wanted to avoid this activity at all cost. However, the day came when we had to pack our things for this three-day trip.</p>
<p>We had to drive for two hours and then walk for an hour in order to reach our destination. We walked in a long, single-file line and endured the strong waves of heat that gleamed on our faces. When we arrived, we were all excited to see the clear blue beach that seemed to welcome us. However, our happiness and excitement did not last long. We immediately set our things down and started our training.</p>
<p>We were taught ten different physical training exercises. At first, it wasn’t so bad; it was actually pretty fun. However, after 50 minutes of continuous exercise, we were exhausted. We wanted to take a break and drink water, yet there was no stopping till we finished going through all ten physical training exercises. The problem was, after 50 minutes, we were still stuck on physical training exercise #1. We had been told to leave our watches and our caps on campus, so we didn’t know how much time passed while the sun scorched as hot as ever onto our faces. It felt like an eternity, finishing that session.</p>
<p>When lunch time finally arrived, we all groaned in pain and exhaustion. We all stuffed our faces with as much food as we could. After eating, we wanted to be done for the day. We did not want to do anything; however, we knew that this was just the beginning. We continued our training after an hour of break. For four hours, we consistently had our physical training exercises in the scorching sun with only a quick five-minute break in the middle. More times than I can count I wanted to cry and give up. My whole body was giving up on me, and I just wanted to stop and hide in the shade.</p>
<p>By the second hour, I actually felt my soul leaving my body. I felt like an empty shell, exercising mindlessly. When I was told to run, I ran. When I was told to lie in the water, I laid down. When I was told to crawl in the hot sand, I crawled. When I was told to do jumping jacks a hundred times, I did it. However, when my mind told me to run away, I could not. Why is that? It is because I was not alone. The hardest thing about the whole training was hearing the groans of my fellow trainees. When I was exhausted and in pain, I was not alone. I could not complain because I knew that others were experiencing the same thing. Even when they made mistakes and we had to receive more punishment, we could not groan because groaning made things worse. That day, we had to learn to accept the mistakes of others. Even when they kept messing up.</p>
<p>Pastor Jun, the director of the program, made it very clear to us that day that loving others is difficult; however, we must endure and understand them because that is what Jesus did. Jesus never complained. In the scorching sun, Jesus was crucified on the cross yet he never complained. Though his disciples all ran away from him, Jesus did not utter a word. Jesus never gave up no matter how difficult the situation may have seemed. Through this S.U.P.E.R Training, I’ve learned to accept the mistakes of others without questioning. I’ve also learned that I should not give up; instead, I should depend on the Lord for help. It was a long three days that we all had to bear; however, through this torturous experience, we all grew a bit more mature in the presence of Christ. I am glad that I was able to complete this training; nevertheless, it is an experience that I never want to repeat again.</p>

<p><img src="https://data.ibtimes.sg/en/full/32054/taal-volcano-philippines.jpg" alt="img">
While the country is currently dealing with an outbreak caused by COVID-19, the Taal volcano in the Philippines has once again displayed signs of increased activity. According to a local agency, several volcanic earthquakes have been recorded from Taal in the past couple of days.</p>
<p>Taal&rsquo;s volcanic activity is currently being monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). Due to the volcano&rsquo;s current activities, its status remains at Alert Level 1.</p>
<p>Increased Volcanic Activity</p>
<p>As indicated in PHIVOLCS&rsquo; latest report, 3 volcanic earthquakes were reported in Taal on June 11. The agency explained that the earthquakes were associated with the rock-fracturing process happening around and beneath the volcano&rsquo;s edifice. The agency also detected weak plumes of steam coming from the vents on Taal&rsquo;s main crater.</p>
<p>PHIVOLCS detected the same level of activity from Taal during the past couple of days. Compared to its status in May, the volcano&rsquo;s activities have decreased this past week. Last month, an average of 10 volcanic earthquakes were detected from Taal daily.</p>
<p>Taal Volcano&rsquo;s Current Status</p>
<p>According to PHIVOLCS, Taal&rsquo;s status is currently at Alert Level 1. Although this status indicates that an eruption is not imminent, the agency warned entering the established danger zones around the volcano is still prohibited. PHIVOLCS also noted that local officials in the area should still continue to monitor the current status of the volcano in preparation for an emergency situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are also advised to observe precautions due to ground displacement across fissures, possible ashfall, and minor earthquakes,&rdquo; PHIVOLCS stated. &ldquo;Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from sudden explosions and wind-remobilized ash may pose hazards to aircraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taal&rsquo;s Previous Eruption</p>
<p>The Taal volcano&rsquo;s last major eruption occurred in January of this year. The powerful eruption occurred after months of increased activity that began in March of 2019. Back then, the status of the volcano was at Alert Level 1.</p>
<p>Due to the possibility of a volcanic tsunami and the magnitude of the eruption, which covered areas surrounding the volcano in ash, the volcano&rsquo;s status was raised to Alert Level 4.

Reuters / Antonio Parrinello</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank this week published a somewhat bizarre research note speculating on a series of potentially catastrophic events it says could befall the global economy in the next decade.</p>
<p>The bank said in a note Tuesday that there is a 33% chance at least one of four scenarios will occur in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>These are: A far more deadly pandemic than COVID-19, a volcanic eruption, a solar flare and global war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important question is what would happen if a much larger, more catastrophic eruption occurred,&rdquo; analysts from the bank asked.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has been pretty much the only story in town for global markets and the world economy in 2020, but Deutsche Bank thinks there is a 33% chance of at least one of four much bigger risks, including a &ldquo;globally catastrophic&rdquo; volcanic eruption taking place over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>In an unconventional note Tuesday, the German bank said: &ldquo;We find there is a one-in-three chance that at least one of four major tail risks will occur within the next decade: a major influenza pandemic killing more than 2 million people; a globally catastrophic volcanic eruption; a major solar flare; or a global war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said this assumes a:</p>
<p>2% annual probability of a flu pandemic killing 2.2 million people.</p>
<p>0.15% chance of a VEI-7 — the highest level volcanic activity — eruption taking place.</p>
<p>1.06% chance of a solar flare — which would disrupt global communications.</p>
<p>0.625% chance of a global war.</p>
<p>Below are Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s four possible scenarios, and how they might hurt the global economy:</p>
<p>A bigger pandemic than COVID-19</p>
<p>Reuters</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank noted that while COVID-19 has had an enormous impact, it has still been less disastrous than other major pandemics such as the Spanish flu in 1918, the Black Death in the 14th century, the Plague of Justinian of the sixth century, and a smallpox outbreak in Japan that began in 735.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said: &ldquo;Before Covid-19 occurred, Madhav et al. (2017) estimated there was an annual probability of 2 per cent that an influenza pandemic will cause 2.2 million pneumonia and influenza deaths or more globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given that Covid-19 has led to a severe recessions and lockdowns in numerous countries, an even more serious pandemic could be even more catastrophic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A VEI-7 volcanic eruption would cause major disruption</p>
<p>The German lender said one of the biggest risks to global stability comes from volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider that the relatively remote Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland shut down nearly all of European airspace in 2010, leading to extensive economic disruption. And further back in 1991, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines was so large it actually led to a reduction in global temperatures over the subsequent two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So an important question is what would happen if a much larger, more catastrophic eruption occurred, and how likely is this to happen,&rdquo; Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>The bank&rsquo;s projections are based on a VEI-7 volcano, the highest level on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, which &ldquo;would cause major disruption on a global scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last time the earth experienced a VEI-7 eruption was in 1815 in Indonesia, when Mount Tambora erupted. That eruption was so devastating that it reduced global temperatures and led 1816 to be dubbed the &ldquo;Year without a summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank said the the next risk comes &ldquo;from millions of miles away&rdquo; — from the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A severe solar storm can cause substantial and long-standing damage here on Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A similar event occurring today would be far more disruptive given that modern technology is based on electronics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There could be major power outages as electrical power grids are disrupted, which in turn would have knock-on effects throughout the economy as critical infrastructure is unable to be run properly,&rdquo; the bank noted.</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank said countries are less likely to go to war than they did in previous decades but nonetheless it still sees this as a risk to global stability.</p>
<p>The bank said it is &ldquo;more difficult to place a probability on the outbreak of war&rdquo; as it includes human calculations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, if we made the conservative assumption that the annual probability of a global war is 0.625% (i.e. a 1 in 160 chance each year), then that means there&rsquo;s a 22 per cent chance that one will take place within the next 40 years,&rdquo; Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>Tensions have flared in recent days between India and China, with some already speculating that the fighting on the two countries&rsquo; Himalayan border could be a catalyst for a major conflict.</p>
<p>Biggest risks possibly beyond this lifetime</p>
<p>Chase Stone</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s research went beyond the decade and possibly even this life-time through a set of extreme &ldquo;possibilities we&rsquo;re unlikely to see in our lifetimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One possible extreme tail risk is a VEI-8 volcanic eruption, which would be much more severe than the VEI-7 cases discussed earlier. One example of this is the eruption of Mount Toba around 75,000 years ago,&rdquo; Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>The bank said another possibility is an asteroid strike which most notably occured around 66 million years ago and led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs and a host of other life on earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this may seem implausible, smaller instances have happened in recorded history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bank concludes: &ldquo;Tail risks that can cause these changes are more common than many realise and it is more likely than not that the coming decades will see another with consequences at least as severe as those caused by COVID-19.&rdquo;

The alarms are red in 2020: Australian bushfires, Taal Volcano in the Philippines, Storm Gloria in the Mediterranean, tornadoes in the U.S. state of Tennessee, heavy rains in Rwanda and Brazil, and COVID-19 in the world. Natural disasters threaten humans more and more.

<h3 id="dutertes-anti-terror-bill-is-another-nail-in-the-coffin-of-the-philippines-waning-democracy">&ldquo;Duterte’s anti-terror bill is another nail in the coffin of the Philippines’ waning democracy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7BFP2TFGNQI6VCMOWINZVA7XSI.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
The timing of the bill has left human rights groups nothing short of skeptical. As the nation continues to struggle through the government’s awful response to the covid-19 pandemic, what does such a law hope to accomplish?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>If enacted, the bill will ease the legal restrictions on law enforcement in defining who is a terrorist and what rights these “terrorists” have under the law. In particular, it allows the warrantless arrest and detainment of those the government-appointed Anti-Terror Council deems “suspicious.” Suspicious activities could range from attempting to damage government property to simply criticizing the administration online. It also allows for the secret surveillance and wiretapping of “suspected” criminals. According to the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, the bill’s loose definition of terrorism allows the government to essentially tag any and all dissenters as terrorists without any judicial oversight.</p>
<p>The bill is yet another example of how the government has attempted to respond to a national crisis in a highly militarized, macho-populist fashion. Last year, Philippines’ Congress — filled with Duterte’s allies — cut 4 billion pesos (more than $80 million) from the nation’s calamity fund; since 2016, when Duterte came to power, it has cut 22.9 billion pesos (nearly $460 million) from the fund. When the Taal volcano erupted in January, rather than accept responsibility for the government’s lackadaisical approach to providing relief, Duterte instead cursed the volcano and threatened to “pee on Taal” to extinguish it. Just a few weeks later, as the nation braced itself for the covid-19 pandemic, Duterte unconvincingly proclaimed that he was looking for the “idiot” coronavirus because he wanted to slap it.</p>
<p>It is clear that Duterte’s traditional playbook of intimidating his opponents in public and overwhelming public dissent with his online troll army on social media is not effective under the stay-at-home reality that covid-19 has forcibly thrust onto the world. No amount of fraudulent accounts spewing misinformation can reconcile the government’s covid-19 response with the fact that many of the nation’s most destitute are being left behind.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>As he often does, Duterte has once again played the blame game, asserting that the Philippines’ failure to contain the pandemic rests on irresponsible lockdown violations by an undisciplined and hardheaded populace. But this narrative of “us vs. them,” wherein the president places the responsibility of his administration’s failures on everyone and everything except himself, is collapsing under the current existential health crisis.</p>
<p>This might explain why Duterte has suddenly called for the swift approval of the “urgent” anti-terrorism bill. Unable to control the narrative as the nation’s poorest starve, Duterte is instead diverting attention by attempting to put a muzzle on the opposition. In May, Philippine media network ABS-CBN was forced off the air, a move that media watchdogs saw as one of Duterte’s many attempts to silence independent press. The proposed anti-terrorism bill is yet another nail in the coffin of the Philippines’ waning democracy.</p>
<p>Duterte’s push for the bill goes beyond just being a mismanaged set of priorities from the administration. His administration is knowingly exploiting the suffering of the Filipino populace in the midst of a global pandemic. It is not attempting to protect the Philippines from a potential terrorist threat, but rather supplying itself with the unchecked power to arrest and detain dissenters. Philippine democracy itself is on the verge of collapse.</p>
