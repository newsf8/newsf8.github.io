(CNN) Things took a dramatic turn during the Season 18 premiere of &ldquo;Keeping Up With The Kardashians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Viewers have grown accustomed to the sisters fighting over the years, but things reached a fever pitch between Kim Kardashian and her older sister Kourtney Kardashian that left fans shocked.</p>
<p>It all started when Kim, Kourtney and Kendall Jenner were discussing Kylie Jenner being too sick to fly to Paris for a fashion show.</p>
<p>Kim said regardless of how sick she&rsquo;s ever been, she will always go to a work commitment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were on my deathbed, I would still show up,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;Mom is so used to &hellip; me and Khloe, whenever, if we&rsquo;re sick&hellip; [Kourtney] you don&rsquo;t care about stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="kim-k-insulted-kendall-jenner-before-fight-with-kourtney-kardashian">Kim K Insulted Kendall Jenner Before Fight With Kourtney Kardashian</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-and-kendall-fight-1585237741.png?crop=0.903xw:1.00xh;0.0561xw,0&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Kim Kardashian got into a huge fight with Kendall Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian because she said their work ethics aren’t as strong as hers.</p>
<p>Kendall suffers from panic attacks that sometimes make it hard for her to make appearances.</p>
<p>Kimberly Noel Kardashian is really out here pissing off her sisters and getting into fistfights because she thinks her work ethic is more admirable than theirs. Kim’s feud with Kourtney Kardashian dates back to July 2018, but up until now, it didn’t seem like she also had an issue with Kendall Jenner. But in a new trailer for this season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim just came for Kendall, who clapped back at her big sister.</p>
<p>The argument started after Kylie Jenner had to miss a Paris Fashion Week show because she was sick and Kim said, “If I were on my deathbed, I would still show up [to appearances].” Kim then said their momager, Kris Jenner, is so used to Kim and Khloé Kardashian “going on our deathbeds” and implied that Kourtney and Kendall aren’t as dedicated.</p>
<p>When Kendall heard that bit, she was like, “And me.” Kim immediately responded, “No, you get anxiety and it’s, like, hard.” Kendall wasn’t having it and told her, “Are you f*cking kidding me? I literally will come at you right now. I swear to god.”</p>
<p>Kim probably meant that in an understanding way, but it came off so judgy in the moment and as if Kendall doesn’t try to work when she’s feeling sick.</p>
<p>Kendall added, “I’ve been sick as f<em>ck, been having major panic attacks. I work my f</em>cking ass off when I’m sick or not.”</p>
<p>Kim then turned everything back on Kourtney and brought up how she thinks Kourtney never works. That’s when Kourtney told Kim she made up some “narrative about this work ethic” in her mind and that she’ll come at her if she doesn’t stop insulting her values. Long story short: Kim continued to test Kourt’s patience, so they got into a huge physical fight.</p>
<p>Congrats, Kris. You’ve reeled me in again, and I’ll be tuning in tonight.

<h3 id="is-kourtney-kardashian-about-to-pull-a-meghan-markle-after-brawl-with-kim">Is Kourtney Kardashian About to Pull a Meghan Markle After Brawl With Kim?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Meg-and-Kourtney.jpg" alt="img">
Kourtney Kardashian is pulling away from her fam, like Meghan Markle and Prince Harry did with the British Royal Fam.</p>
<p>She and Kim Kardashian literally fought over it. They hit each other in the Season 18 premiere of “Keeping Up With The Kardashians.”</p>
<p>It appears the shocking act of domestic violence on camera actually drew them closer together.</p>
<p>Kourtney Kardashian might be planning her own “Megxit” from the Kardashian clan. She’s been slowly growing more distant, and not putting in the filming hours. She says the change is due to conversations she’s been having with her therapist.</p>
<p>The reasons she gives sound an awful lot like Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s reasons for stepping out of the spotlight. Is Kourtney Kardashian about to go full Meghan Markle and step away from her duties as a Kardashian–America’s royalty?</p>
<p>It’s looking more and more like that may be the case.</p>
<p>Kourtney Kardashian Pulling Back</p>
<p>Over Season 16 and 17 of “Keeping Up,” Kourtney and her sisters, Kim and Khloé have been getting increasingly impatient with each other. The tension is growing among the trio, with Kourtney as the odd woman out.</p>
<p>The sibling rivalry is reminiscent of reports that Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton were feuding behind the scenes before Megxit. Vanity Fair’s royal commentator believes Markle couldn’t handle being “second best” to the Duchess of Cambridge. She reportedly even gave Middleton a knife for Christmas last December. That says it all.</p>
<p>The quarrels between the sisters Kardashian finally boiled over last season. There was an entire episode devoted to Kim and Khloé confronting Kourtney about putting in fewer and fewer hours filming for the show.</p>
<p>The reasons Kourtney Kardashian gave were very Meghan Markle.</p>
<p>Kourtney Channels ex-Royal Meghan Markle in Growing Feud with Kim Kardashian</p>
<p>In the season premier, the fight got physical. “Keeping Up” fans were not prepared to see domestic violence between Kourtney and Kim Kardashian.</p>
<p>Watch Kourtney Kardashian push Kim Kardashian to the floor after saying, “I will literally f*** you up!” Kim jumped up and kicked Kourtney, who kicked her back. Then Kim chased her sister into the hall and slapped her face:</p>
<p>The reason for the pullback is Kourtney began talking to a new therapist in 2017. The therapist told Kourtney Kardashian to reevaluate her life and her priorities completely. As a result, she started filming less, due to the demands of the show keeping her from her kids and traveling.</p>
<p>That’s the tack Meghan Markle and Prince Harry took when they stepped back.</p>
<p>By November last year, Kourtney said she would take an indefinite break from the show. But by February, Kris Jenner announced that after a three-month hiatus, Kourtney would be back on the show full time.</p>
<p>Wait, Is Everything Okay Now?</p>
<p>Maybe Kourtney is also tired of playing second fiddle to Kim Kardashian, the way Meghan Markle couldn’t get comfortable being “second best” to Kate Middleton.</p>
<p>Despite the brawl, it appears the sisters have drawn closer together. Two weeks ago, Kim posted a photo of the two together saying Kourtney is “the bbq sauce to my honey mustard!” The only catch is that neither of these ladies appears to be very sweet.</p>
