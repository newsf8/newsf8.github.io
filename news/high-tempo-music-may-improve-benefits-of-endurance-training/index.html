<p>LONDON</p>
<p>Researchers have demonstrated for the first time that listening to high-tempo music may increase the benefits of exercise, and reduce perceived effort, particularly during endurance training.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, including those from the University of Verona in Italy, while earlier studies have documented some of the beneficial links between music and exercise, the specific properties of music that affect us during training remains unknown.</p>
<p>The current study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, accessed 19 active women in their mid-20s during endurance walking for 10 minutes on a treadmill, and high intensity exercise under four different randomly assigned conditions—without music, and with music played at low, moderate, and high tempo.</p>
<p>The scientists recorded a variety of parameters, including the volunteers’ opinions about the effort required to complete the exercises, and their heart rate while exercising.</p>
<p>“We found that listening to high-tempo music while exercising resulted in the highest heart rate, and lowest perceived exertion compared with not listening to music,” explained study co-author Luca P. Ardigo of the University of Verona in Italy.</p>
<p>“This means that the exercise seemed like less effort, but it was more beneficial in terms of enhancing physical fitness,” Ardigo added.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, the effects were more noticeable in volunteers completing the endurance exercise sessions, compared with those performing high-intensity exercises.</p>
<p>Based on this finding, the scientists suggested that people performing endurance activities such as walking or running may receive the greatest benefit from listening to high-tempo music.</p>
<p>However, the researchers cautioned that the sample size of the study was small, and larger studies in the future are needed to continue exploring the nuances of how music affects our training.</p>
<p>“In the current study, we investigated the effect of music tempo in exercise, but in the future we would also like to study the effects of other music features such as genre, melody, or lyrics, on endurance and high intensity exercise,” Ardigo said. — PTI

<p><img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2019/12/Sauda-Khara-khara-Good-Newwz.jpg" alt="img">
The &rsquo;90s hit Punjabi song Sauda Khara Khara, sung by Sukhbir, has been remade in the Akshay Kumar-Kareena Kapoor starrer Good Newwz. The song was released today, and is an example of how an old hit can be remade without compromising on the flavour of the original.</p>
<p>Sukhbir is known for up-tempo Pujabi songs like Ishq Tera Tadpave and Gal Ban Gayee. Sauda Khara Khara, originally picturised on Bipasha Basu and Dino Morea, was one of his big hits from the &rsquo;90s. Despite inclusion of new lyrics in the remake version, the original has been done justice to.</p>
<p>Diljit Dosanjh, who appears in the song, has sung the new lyrics, alongwith Dhvani Bhanushali singing for Kiara Advani. Sukhbir returns to sing the chorus from the original and also dance with Kiara and Diljit on screen.</p>
<p>The actors turn up as baraatis in the song, with full on bhangra moves on display. Akshay Kumar too makes an entry, showing off his crazy dance moves. He even does the wedding staple &lsquo;naagin dance&rsquo; while sitting on the groom&rsquo;s horse!</p>
<p>The setting is that of a wedding and the song is likely to be a popular track played at weddings this season. Watch it here:</p>
<p>Good Newwz, releasing on December 27, stars Diljit-Kiara and Akshay-Kareena as two married couples who undergo IVF, hoping for a baby. Their lives get entangled after a sperm goof-up at the fertilisation clinic. The film is directed by Raj Mehta and produced by Karan Johar.</p>

<h3 id="punjab-police-arrest-9-for-forging-curfew-passes-for-transporting-stranded-labourers">&ldquo;Punjab Police arrest 9 for forging curfew passes for transporting stranded labourers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cmsimages.tribuneindia.com/gallary_content/2020/4/2020_4$largeimg_888486085.JPG" alt="img">
Tribune News Service</p>
<p>Chandigarh, April 24</p>
<p>Amid the COVID-19 curfew and lockdown, the Punjab Police have busted a gang engaged in making forged passes for stranded migrant labourers, with 71 such labourers already transported by them to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in exchange for a total consideration of Rs 3.5 lakh.</p>
<p>Nine members of the gang have been arrested and cases registered against them under various sections at the Tanda police station, disclosed DGP Dinkar Gupta, adding that five fake passes, a stamp of SDM Tanda, a computer, a CPU, a printer and six mobile phones used by them had been seized. One member of the gang is absconding.</p>
<p>The DGP said the accused were charging approximately Rs 60,000 for a tempo traveller and Rs 30,000 for Innova car.</p>
<p>Of the 71 labourers smuggled out of Punjab so far with the help of fake curfew passes, 13 were sent in a truck, 20 each in two tempo travellers and six each in three Innova cars.</p>
<p>Four rounds had so far been made by vehicles carrying such migrants since April 12 to Gonda district of Bihar, as well as Lucknow and Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, he informed.</p>
<p>The gang was busted on the basis of information that came to the notice of Hoshiarpur police that some fake/illegal curfew passes had been used to cross the border from Punjab to Haryana and UP.</p>
<p>Trouble arose for the gang when alert officials on duty at Shambhu barrier in Rajpura became suspicious and asked one of the vehicles carrying such migrants to return to Tanda.</p>
<p>On returning to Tanda, the labourers started demanding their money back from the accused, and the whispers of the same reached the police, said the DGP.</p>
<p>Divulging the modus operandi of the accused, SSP Hoshiyarpur, Gaurav Garg, who spearheaded the investigations, said they had created forged curfew passes using computer software and the same were pasted on the windscreen of the vehicles.</p>
<p>The driver and associate cleaner of the vehicle were given copies of the forged passes, which were made by photoshopping an original pass issued by Batala-SDM to a taxi driver for travelling to IGI Airport, Delhi.</p>
<p>The accused met the driver at a petrol pump at Shambhu border while having lunch, and the former showed them his pass, of which they took photographs on the pretext of using it to move around without hassle.</p>
<p>However, they soon got the idea of using the photo of the pass to fake passes and make money.</p>
<p>The accused have been identified as Satnam Singh alias Jassi, Ravi Kumar alias Ravi, Gaurav Kumar, Sukhwinder Singh alias Raju, Chander Mohan, Ajay Pal, Kamal Mehra, Vishal Vohra alias Shanu and Pankaj Kumar.</p>
<p>The accused on the run has been identified as Chandan alias Chandu.

This story is from September 12, 2019</p>
<p>Image used for representational purpose</p>
<p>CHANDIGARH: The social media duel between three Punjabi singers ended on Wednesday evening with the arrest of Harkirat Singh Mangat, alias Elly Mangat, while he was live on Instagram and trying to enter Purab Premium Apartments in Sector 88, the site the singers had decided for a face-off.</p>
<p>Mohali police on Tuesday booked Mangat and two other Punjabi singers - Prince Randhawa and Rami Randhawa , known as Randhawa brothers, who live in the apartments - for issuing threats to each other on social media and also arrested Rami Randhawa.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Prince Randhawa surrendered at the Sohana police station.</p>
<p>The singers had claimed on their social media accounts that they would &ldquo;sort out their issues&rdquo; face-to-face and dared each other to meet at the apartments on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Mangat, who had flown in from Canada, was held at the gates of the apartments while driving an SUV.</p>
<p>A senior police officer said it looked more of a publicity stunt but they could not have taken it lightly given the nature of threats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suspect it to be a ploy of some kind to gain fame. But we could not have taken any chances. Who knows this all could be for real,&rdquo; said a senior officer of the Mohali police.</p>
<p>The singers have been taunting and threatening each other on social media for a while. While Randhawa brothers accused Mangat of singing vulgar songs and told him not to do that, the latter had responded in kind telling he would thrash them. The singers had posted threatening videos on their accounts and decided to have a freestyle fight. While Mangat has 5,99,000 followers on Instagram, Rami Randhawa has 63,000. Police had booked the singers under sections 294, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 .</p>
<p>Police after taking Rami Randhawa into custody beefed up security at the apartments and checked every apartment to verify the tenants living there.</p>
<p>A police officer said that there seemed to be something fishy about the entire act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they want to fight with each other, why tell the world. It seemed they just wanted publicity and increase their followers on social media. But we couldn&rsquo;t have ignored it all and that&rsquo;s why took all the precautionary measures,&rdquo; said a police officer handling the case.</p>
<p>At night, police stepped up security at the apartments, checking vehicles entering the complex.</p>

Special Feature: 16 best recent Bollywood remakes of Punjabi songs</p>
<p>In the world of Bollywood music, remakes has been the trend for a few years now. Reviving super-hit songs with a funky new sound wouldn’t have become a popular trend if it wasn’t for Punjabi music that has played a super major role. While we take a break from new music with the world in lockdown, we look back at some of the best Punjabi remakes that came out of Bollywood in the last two years.</p>
<p>By far the biggest Punjabi remake is when Tanishk Bagchi takes on Panjabi MC with the wedding party track Morni Banke in the movie ‘Badhaai Ho’ (2018). The original Punjabi version is still a must play at weddings and Punjabi parties but this one has a whole new musicality and class to. He has taken the urban out of Panjabi MC’s version and made this a lot more traditional Punjabi that makes it sound a lot more authentic than the original. The Punjabi effect goes to the next level with his choice of singers Guru Randhawa and Neha Kakkar who deliver to what is expected of them with lot of vocal styling and effects. There is energy, attitude and performance element to the song overall that helps deliver a well-executed music video too. Lyrics by MellowD are quite amazing and as good as one would here in a traditional Punjabi song rather than a Bollywood redo. Overall this song was an easy winner and one of the best remakes in any category of music.</p>
<p>Another big winner was when Navraj Hans and Harshdeep Kaur delivered a fresh new take of Malkit Singh’s Gur Naal Ishq Mitha with some good production elements to it in the movie ‘Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga’ (2019). Rochak Kohli delivers a totally different take on the musicality of this song going back to core Punjabi music compared to the original which really topped the charts then with a western beat throughout. The stark contract in treatment actually worked very well putting this song strongly in a wedding sequence making it instantly relatable and super enjoyable. The lyrics are entertaining and capture a whole plethora of tease, romance, and showering blessings to make this a song for the full family to come together on. Kaur’s warm vocals are the best part of the song while Hans has such a unique style that the song genuinely works as a pure traditional Punjabi wedding song.</p>
<p>Going beyond the dance genre, Meet Bros geo together with Kumaar in ‘Marjaavaan’ (2019) to recreate Kinna Sona originally made famous by the legendry Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The music retains the original melody on the chorus with its Punjabi touch that has been executed well with some Dholki &amp; Harmonium but reinforced with guitars and electronic drum beats to make it relevant in 2019 which really worked. For a soulful romantic number the composition is also upbeat giving a very positive and happy aura to the song. The new lyrics by Kumaar are just brilliant making this a completely unique song using just the hook line of the original. To top it further the choice of singers with Nautiyal and Dhvani Bhanushali is perfect for this song. Nautiyal sounds truly lovable while Bhanushali has that innocence &amp; shyness about it that works really well with the lyrics. A great remake to say the least!</p>
<p>Another great soft romantic Punjabi remake is Photo from ‘Luka Chuppi’ (2019). Karan Sehmbi’s original 2016 song comes together with the lyrics of Nirmaan and musical vibes of Bagchi on this one which has a lot more Hindi than Punjabi in this remake. The strong rural Punjabi vocal touch mixes well with a modern delivery style with some quality vocal texture that is soothing to the ears. The urban vibes are very clean with a deep beat and gentle flute solos on the bridge. The lyrics are quite well written with simple emotions captured well without much complication of words making it an easy one to sing along to making this a great romantic number to groove to on a sunny romantic drive.</p>
<p>The movie ‘Jawaani Jaaneman’ (2020) gave us Gallan Kardi that took Jazzy B &amp; Apache Indian’s 2005 Dil Lutiya and gave it a full makeover mashing up the UK bhangra, Asian urban and Bollywood styles to create a great party number in tune with the current music trend. Bringing Jazzy B back to deliver his unique vocal is the real strength of this remake. A great addition to the song and adding the UK touch is Mumzy Stranger with a consistent and well written rap that goes all through rather than the typical one rap stanza. Kudos to Prem-Hardeep for the music and arranging this remake. The mix of all elements is quite nicely balanced and has a good amount of compositional variety while the music is simple and repetitive for it to be effective on the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Honey Singh marked his big return to delivering hits with superhit dance songs Dil Chori in ‘Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety’ (2018). Taking Hans Raj Hans’s original and giving it a Bollywood touch came quite naturally and made this an easy hit. Vocals by Simar Kaur, Ishers and Honey Singh’s rap are all excellently delivered to a proper modern Punjabi beat that makes this a fabulous remake and an easy feather on Honey Singh’s hat of hit songs.</p>
<p>Rishi Rich collaborated with Badshah to bring back his 2006 UK hit with Master Rakesh – Bhare Bazaar in the movie ‘Namaste England’ (2018). Musically the song slowed down a bit but with a sexy bassline added to it to make it more Bollywood fitting that totally worked! With the Punjabi dhols removed to make way for a more urban electronic beat made the music perfect to make this remake a dancefloor burner. The interesting bit of the song is the vocal takeover by Vishal Dadlani replacing Master Rakesh and he delivered it super well. His energy is electrifying and is matched well by Payal Dev and Badshah of course.</p>
<p>Recent hit ‘Good Newwz’ (2019) gave us two big Punjabi remakes. Sauda Khara Khara is a remake of the original Bhangra king of India – Sukhbir’s 1999 hit where Kumaar put in a good amount of new lyrics to create brand new stanzas while only using the chorus of Sukhbir’s 1999 hit. The vibrant lyrics made it a fit song for the wedding music scene. The music by Lijo George – DJ Chetas has a strong Punjabi tinge to it while Sukhbir added in the hooks and fast dhol beats from his original. There is a good amount of musical variation in the song that keeps the listener constantly engaged. The interesting twist in this remake is that instead of Sukhbir, Dosanjh leads the vocal here with Dhvani Bhanushali while Sukhbir sticks to the chorus. All in all a decent good party number and it was good to see Sukhbir back in style with this remake.</p>
<p>Remake of the 2004 Bhangra banger Laal Ghaghra was yet another Punjabi dancefloor blazer in this movie. Bagchi brought back Sahara &amp; Manj Musik of RDB to remake this hit one with a slightly stronger Punjabi touch from Bollywood standards. The music was strongly based on dhol beats, clarinets with constant hoye hoye shouts to keep it rather traditional but with the tempo slowed down to make it more palatable for commercial Bollywood listeners. Neha Kakkar was the best new thing added on this remake with her charismatic vocal. The additional lyrics brought in a bit more fun to the song while keeping it easy to sing along to.</p>
<p>Ayushmaan Khurrana in his movie ‘Bala’ (2019) brought in a Punjabi pop revival of a rather recent 2017 hit called Naah Goriye by B Praak and Harrdy Sandhu. The composition in this remake was not too far from the original with a shaper beat and a massive sprinkle of Spanish guitars but it exposed Bollywood to this gem of a new-age Punjabi music. The lyrics by Jaani are near bouts the same on this remake with a brand new female lead delivered by Swasti Jain. She delivered that powerful but crude Punjabi vocal with a touch of folk and a touch of sensuality about it making this a good one that is still an easy hit on the dancefloor.</p>
<p>The latest release Illegal Weapon 2.0 from the movie ‘Street Dancer 3D’ (2020) stands out from the other Punjabi remakes on this album including Sip Sip and Lagdi Lahore Di. A remake of the 2017 original of Garry Sandhu with Jasmine Sandlas Illegal Weapon, Bagchi added a lot more attack to the music of this remake making it a lot more Bollywood worthy and danceable for an urban dance battle movie. The programmed synthetic beats &amp; bass are crisp with strong urban vibes that are a treat to pump through the speakers. The fresh set of part Hindi lyrics by Priya Saraiya make the song work for both Hindi and Punjabi music markets. The music doesn’t stand out by far from the original this a good song for both singers to make a mark in Bollywood.</p>
<p>‘Jabariya Jodi’ (2019) delivered the remake of Khadke Glassy of the original Ashok Mastie and Honey Singh collaboration. The music &amp; additional lyrics by Bagchi are a fair addition to the original vocals &amp; lyrics by Channi Rakhala. Honey Singh’s original composition blends a fair bit of urban beats with Punjabi and Bagchi only extended that further adding some more modern beats and urban sound effects. There are some interesting sounds &amp; programming bits added in and the female vocals by Jyotica Tangri are quite interesting. This was a good revival for long forgotten Ashok Mastie and very good easy-flowing lyrics by Bagchi.</p>
<p>Another big one is the remake of The Wakhra Swag from the movie ‘Judgementall Hai Kya’ (2019) with Bagchi leading this remake of the huge Punjabi number from 2015. He retained a lot of the original lyrics and the original artist Navv Inder leading the vocals while bringing in Lisa Mishra to lead the female vocals who really takes center stage compared to Inder taking over the full song in the original. Her vocals have a strong swag quality being sensuous and strong at the same time. While the original featured rap by Badshah, he was well replaced by Raja Kumari delivering the female rap in this remake. The music does not go far from the original keeping the same tempo and hook pieces with the tumbi leading the melody of the song but Bagchi added a strong deep bass line to the track mixing it well with some dhol beats in the chorus giving it a little more contemporary feel.</p>
<p>In the typical Bagchi style another remake Pyaar Tenu Karda Gabru featured in ‘Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhaan’ (2020) and is a remake of Honey Singh and J-Star’s 2011 Punjabi hit – Gabru. Vayu flipped the lyrics around to make this a song with subtle gay tonalities and to be a lash out against the society stereotypes about homosexuality making this a themed remake. The lyrical execution is very interesting as the song mixes Punjabi and Hindi switching the direction of the song from a female to a male target. Romy delivered the vocal with a swag delivering the Punjabi in an authentic style while Bagchi simplified the traditional Punjabi music in the original and striped it back to a more Bollywood style urban beat.</p>
<p>Another remake to mention is Hauli Hauli from ‘De De Pyaar De’ (2019) which turned out to be the big club party tune featuring a colab between Garry Sandhu with Neha Kakkar on Bagchi’s music. The authentic &amp; crude folkish vocals balance off well against Kakkar’s sultry and boldly exuberant vocals. The hook music is quite strong and rides on a strong urban beat blended with a rap piece by Mellow D in this remake.</p>
<p>Bagchi also delivered Koka in the movie ‘Khandaani Shafakhana’ (2019) bringing back the Jasbir Jassi original given a rap treatment with Badshah here in the remake and Dhvani Bhanushali leading the female vocals. The melody and groove is quite strong in this remake turning this Punjabi song into completely a Hindi number with a decent dance vibe to move to.</p>
