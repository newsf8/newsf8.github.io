<p>Have you ever wondered what your rights are as an artist? There’s no clear-cut textbook to consult—but we’re here to help. Katarina Feder, a vice president at Artists Rights Society, is answering questions of all sorts about what kind of control artists have—and don’t have—over their work.</p>
<p>Do you have a query of your own? Email [email protected] and it may get answered in an upcoming article.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art apologize for posting images of Glenn Ligon’s work to their social-media feeds without his permission. I know that it was in support of Black Lives Matter, but once I heard they didn’t ask first, it struck me as wrong. Was it illegal as well?</p>
<p>Those two museums made a mistake, and as you pointed out, subsequently apologized.</p>
<p>For the most part—and this often comes as a surprise to people—museums don’t actually own the reproduction rights to works in their collection. The artist retains the underlying copyright to the work and any reproductions of it unless he or she agrees to sign it over (remember artists: don’t do it!).</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if the work is hanging in the home of a private collector, locked in a storage unit in Brooklyn, or displayed prominently on the walls of a famed institution. When a museum wants to post an image from their collection, they are almost always obligated to seek the artist’s permission.</p>
<p>On his own Instagram, Ligon responded to the wave of posts: “I know its #nationalreachouttoblackfolksweek but could y’all just stop. Or ask me first?”</p>
<p>It seems that institutions were allowing the work of this American legend to do the heavy lifting for them on a subject that they found challenging to address directly. (It’s worth noting that Ligon is often associated with a movement known as “post-black,” a term he helped coin, which aims to push back against the oversimplification of art and identity.)</p>
<p>We can all learn from this flub on the part of museums. Let’s do our best not to exploit, or even simplify, the life’s work of creators for a quick social-media fix. And if you’re uncomfortable asking for permission, maybe that means the post wasn’t such a good idea in the first place.</p>
<p>I want to ask about something that’s always bugged me about the “Blue Lives Matter” movement. How are its supporters able to appropriate the Punisher logo for those stickers you see on the backs of cars? In addition to the fact that it makes no sense, as the Punisher is a vigilante who’s job is to shirk, not uphold, the law, they seem to be messing with the copyright of an entity owned by the Walt Disney Corporation. How do they get away with it?</p>
<p>Whether the gruesome Punisher skull should be adopted by anyone, let alone the police, is a moral question we can get into later. Whether it can be adopted is a legal question I’ll tackle first.</p>
<p>The character of the Punisher was created by Gerry Conway, John Romita Sr., and Ross Andru in 1974 under the aegis of Marvel Comics, which owns the copyright and trademark rights to the character and the skull logo that emanated from it. (It was not customary for artists working for Marvel to retain copyrights to their work.)</p>
<p>This raises an obvious question: if Marvel owns the copyright, then why do we see infringements everywhere? The answer has to do with a very important aspect of copyright protection, and that is enforcement.</p>
<p>To address copyright enforcement, allow me to direct your attention to another iconic comic character: Bill Watterson’s Calvin, of Calvin and Hobbes fame.</p>
<p>Watterson’s creation was the subject of a shady 1990s pre-Instagram meme—a bumper sticker that pictured Calvin sporting a devilish grin and peeing on things that the car’s owner disapproved of. These were obvious knock-offs; Calvin never looked quite right and the image was in total opposition to the tone of Watterson’s comic strips, which was quite philosophical and soulful.</p>
<p>Because these decals were being produced and shared by hundreds of individuals across the country—and because Watterson never officially licensed Calvin’s image for merchandising—cease-and-desist letters amounted to a costly game of whack-a-mole. As a spokeswoman for United Press Syndicate, the company that distributed Calvin and Hobbes, explained in 1998, “When you license a character, then you increase the number of attorneys who keep a lookout and protect the images.”</p>
<p>This brings us back to Marvel and the Punisher. It would seem that at some point, Disney, which owns Marvel, did a cost-benefit analysis in terms of how much they might make off these lawsuits versus how much they’d spend to litigate them—not to mention what they might lose from boycotts of their movies by cop fans—and decided they could live with the infringement.</p>
<p>It is a real pity, however, that the Punisher has been adopted by those who have been tasked with upholding the law. The skull logo is reminiscent of the “Totenkopf,” a skull-and-crossbones symbol worn by the SS during the Second World War. When modern agents of authority wear it, one begins to question what ideals they’re protecting.</p>
<p>I make children’s books. I know I own the US copyright to a book I illustrated, but now the images are being sent to an ebook converter in India. How do I protect my art in countries outside the US? Does US copyright cover this?</p>
<p>Ah, children’s books. You absorb our drool and teach us to read. You inspire a love of literature that burns long into adulthood. Then we share these beloved stories with our own children… in the form of big-budget Hollywood films that pad out a 30-page book with, like, ten subplots.</p>
<p>Just as your copyright would be protected if your book were optioned into a movie, so it remains durable in its translation to ebooks and the Indian market.</p>
<p>On paper, India’s dedication to copyright is actually more rigorous than our own. The country joined the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the world’s most significant international copyright instrument, in 1928, well before the US followed suit in 1989. The Berne Convention has three underlying principles:</p>
<p>A member country must extend the same treatment it offers its own creators to citizens of other member countries. The convention requires member countries to adopt certain minimum standards for copyright protection. If the work in question has fallen out of copyright in its country of origin, it may be denied protection in a member country.</p>
<p>So how do you enforce your rights, which are particularly important for ebooks, which are frequently the victims of piracy? As an American creator, I would (perhaps unsurprisingly!) advise you to join Artists Rights Society, which has reciprocal relationships with more than 40 sister societies around the globe.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ARS has no sister society in India that I can direct you to, so I would recommend getting in touch with a local intellectual property lawyer to help you navigate the nuances of enforcement (which could cost a lot of $$$). With any luck, your ebook will become a massive smash and you will be able to reap the financial rewards. Does Bollywood do adaptations?</p>
<p>I just learned about this thing called the Projansky contract. What are the pros and cons of it? With all this money floating around the art market, why aren’t more artists using the Projansky contract or something like it?</p>
<p>If you care about making sure artists are paid, then the Projansky contract—sometimes called “The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement”—is indeed a wonderful thing. Basically, it’s a contract between the artist and the initial buyer that guarantees that 15 percent of any return on the work goes back to the artist after a resale. That means if an artist sells a painting for $30,000 with a Projansky contract attached, and the buyer resells it later for $100,000, the artist would net $10,500 (15 percent of the upside) from the deal.</p>
<p>The contract was created by the conceptual art dealer Seth Siegelaub and the lawyer Robert Projansky in 1971 in response to a series of high-profile auction sales including the Robert Scull collection, which absolutely blew people’s minds when it made $2.2 million. (Even with inflation, that would only be equivalent to $12.7 million today, so, yes, the market has grown a lot since then.)</p>
<p>The contract had a number of boosters, including the artist Hans Haacke. (Haacke, who still uses it today, added some additional terms, including that he had to approve loans to group exhibitions and that he could borrow any work for exhibitions of his choosing for 60 days out of every five years.)</p>
<p>Critics of the contract, meanwhile, say it hurts business. “The last thing I was interested in,’” artist Mel Bochner said of the Projansky contract, “was the formation of more bureaucracy, of another kind of art police.”</p>
<p>If the US government adopted a Federal Resale Royalty—a law, like those in place in some 80 countries worldwide, that requires a percentage of the resale price return to the artist—much of this discussion would be moot. Although an appeals court struck down a version of this law in California in 2018, ARS has co-authored a resale rights bill presently before Congress (but goodness knows they have a lot on their hands at the moment).</p>
<p>“We never expected this to become the standard of the art world, but we wanted to raise the subject and maybe influence some legislation,” Projansky himself told the New York Times in 1974. Here, here.</p>

<h3 id="here-are-the-2020-oregon-book-award-winners">&ldquo;Here are the 2020 Oregon Book Award winners&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/imMjIMNLrjer14ZoqWhmqI1GG5Y=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/RC5QBVPSH5A4XFHAIYJSJBVTOQ.jpg" alt="img">
The Portland nonprofit Literary Arts announced Monday night the seven books that won 2020 Oregon Book Awards, chosen from among more than 200 submissions.</p>
<p>The awards are typically handed out in a live ceremony that draws Portland’s literary community to applaud short speeches by each of the winning authors, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, Literary Arts shifted to a radio broadcast hosted by two previous Oregon Book Award winners, Omar El-Akkad (”American War”) and Elena Passarello (”Animals Strike Curious Poses”). The two reminisced fondly about what it was like to win before turning to announcing most of this year’s award recipients. Oregon poet laureate Anis Mojgani announced the poetry and special awards.</p>
<p>The winning authors, who read excerpts from or discussed their books on the broadcast, received $1,000.</p>
<p>KEN KESEY AWARD FOR FICTION</p>
<p>Kesha Ajọsẹ Fisher of Portland, “No God Like the Mother”: Fisher’s perspective as a Nigerian American woman informs this collection of nine stories whose characters often struggle to keep a firm grasp on identity and relationships.</p>
<p>STAFFORD/HALL AWARD FOR POETRY</p>
<p>Ashley Toliver of Portland, “Spectra”: This three-part collection runs a finger along the dual-edged swords – creation on one side, destruction on the other – wielded by both our relationships and our bodies.</p>
<p>FRANCES FULLER VICTOR AWARD FOR GENERAL NONFICTION</p>
<p>David Wolman and Julian Smith of Portland, “Aloha Rodeo: Three Hawaiian Cowboys, the World’s Greatest Rodeo, and a Hidden History of the American West”: Those who attended the 1908 Frontier Days extravaganza in Cheyenne, Wyoming, saw a rodeo unlike any other, as three paniolos from the Hawaiian islands challenged the very notion of a cowboy. Wolman and Smith explain with gusto how this singular moment came to be.</p>
<p>SARAH WINNEMUCCA AWARD FOR CREATIVE NONFICTION</p>
<p>Beth Alvarado of Bend, “Anxious Attachments”: This essay collection is practically a master class in the genre, as Alvarado tackles themes such as addiction, grief and environmental racism with steady prose and compassion.</p>
<p>ELOISE JARVIS MCGRAW AWARD FOR CHILDREN’S LITERATURE</p>
<p>Cathy Camper of Portland, “Lowriders Blast from the Past”: In this appealing graphic novel presented in English and Spanish, three young friends bond over their love of cars and over the bullies who target them.</p>
<p>LESLIE BRADSHAW AWARD FOR YOUNG ADULT LITERATURE</p>
<p>Deborah Hopkinson of West Linn, “How I Became A Spy: A Mystery of WWII”: Bertie is just a kid, so he can only contribute to the war effort in London as a bike messenger – until he stumbles across a notebook that appears to contain coded messages that could help the Allies.</p>
<p>AWARD FOR GRAPHIC LITERATURE</p>
<p>Greg Means and M.K. Reed of Portland, “Penny Nichols”: This tongue-in-cheek tale about a very amateur effort to make a slasher flick is a hilarious ode to creativity, the can-do spirit and friendship.</p>
<p>SPECIAL AWARDS</p>
<p>Literary Arts also announced this year’s winners of three special awards.</p>
<p>Walt Morey Young Readers Literary Legacy Award: Reading Results, of Portland, which works to support childhood literacy.</p>
<p>The Stewart H. Holbrook Literary Legacy Award: Write Around Portland, of Portland, which uses writing as a tool for working toward equity.</p>
<p>C.E.S. Wood Award: Lawson Inada of Ashland, Oregon’s fifth poet laureate from 2006 to 2010, who read a poem on the broadcast.</p>
<p>You can hear all the authors who were finalists reading from their work at Literary Arts’ website.</p>

Yet what Marquee’s team knew long before the virus outbreak, and believe even more fervently now, is this: The future of the performing arts is digital.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And if U.S. arts groups want to survive the coronavirus crisis and beyond, they need to focus on getting their work online, those at the streaming service say — because American artists have fallen far behind their peers overseas.</p>

<p>“Doing digital isn’t a quick-fix Band-Aid for anyone,” says Kathleya Afanador, Marquee’s co-founder and head of content. “It’s a fundamental layer of their overall business that needs to be prioritized.”</p>
<p>Marquee launched in the United Kingdom in 2018, offering handsomely filmed performances from such international venues as London’s Royal Opera House, Moscow’s Bolshoi Theater and the Opéra National de Paris. It works much like a Netflix or Amazon account, with subscribers having access to a wide range of performances and documentaries on the arts. (Subscriptions cost $4.99 weekly, $8.99 monthly and $89.99 annually, with a current discounted rate of $62.99 a year.)</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Kirschner declined to give an exact subscriber figure, but said it’s in the tens of thousands, mostly across the United States and the United Kingdom. The site is available in about 20 countries.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Marquee officials describe the shows they offer as “high-quality captures,” produced using multiple cameras and led by directors experienced in bringing stage performances to the screen. In most cases, Marquee has gained the rights to air existing films, though it plans to increase its commissioning of films by helping to fund and produce them. On Friday, Marquee launched its first commissioned project — Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young’s dance-theater work “Revisor,” based on a farce by Nikolai Gogol and filmed shortly before the pandemic-related shutdowns.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“These aren’t just archived films of live performances. It’s a very sophisticated operation,” says Gregory Doran, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, which has several recently filmed plays available on Marquee (as well as on other British streaming services).</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“The challenge for us was to create a language that suited each production. Not just get the cameras onstage and get the sound right,” Doran says, “but to make them stand out as pieces of art in their own right.”</p>
<p>On June 13, Marquee aired its first live-streamed event since the shutdowns: a danced duet and music performances from London’s Royal Opera House, minus the audience. Another will air on Saturday.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>This is all good news for arts-starved viewers who are hungry for great works and fresh adaptations.</p>
<p>It also reveals what Marquee officials see as a big problem for the performing arts in the United States: They lag dangerously far behind those abroad in having a digital strategy.</p>
<p>“They’ve ignored it, to be really honest,” Kirschner says. “To have a digital focus was just pushed aside. It was, ‘This is not a priority for us.’ ”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Marquee’s catalogue includes many American artists and companies showcased in gorgeous presentations — including Bill T. Jones, the Paul Taylor Dance Company and the New York City Ballet. But in most cases, these works were filmed overseas by well-equipped production companies, in London, Paris, Madrid and other international cities.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Kirschner points to the example set by Arts Council England, a government-funded agency that promotes the performing, visual and literary arts.</p>
<p>“It started demanding digital mandates 15 years ago for their arts organizations,” he says. “That grew into a production subsidy fund, to support the creation of great art, make it accessible, center it on equity and sustainability. They see digital as the solution for all of that.</p>
<p>“In the U.S., it’s been an inversion. Everybody’s been focusing on different priorities, and they see digital as a subset.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>It’s an age-old lament: American arts groups don’t enjoy the luxuries of their peers across the pond with their greater state-supported benefits, which even include a solid digital strategy. According to Kirschner, agreements with stakeholders, including unions, often can be a complication for U.S. organizations seeking to make digital recordings.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Yet while a solution for these groups is not easily at hand, the argument that the performing arts here need to power up online is potent, especially now.</p>
<p>As shuttered arts groups have seen their income streams vanish and are scrambling to stay on funders’ and the public’s radars so they can survive until theaters reopen, a lack of recorded content is a problem. How do these groups make their work known to people staying home?</p>
<p>For a sector that depends on people leaving their homes, what if people don’t do so for a very long time?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Arts organizations are gasping for oxygen right now,” says Alonzo King, founder of the San Francisco-based LINES Ballet. Several of his fluid, vigorous and deeply musical works are featured on Marquee, which he’s happy about since the public’s reluctance to gather in theaters could be long-lasting.</p>
<p>“So we have to change how we do things in America,” King says. “For every organization involved in theater, the dream is two things: to return to that humanity” — performers and audiences in the same physical space — “but also to always have a digital presence as well.”</p>
<p>King says he receives no direct financial benefit from having his ballets on Marquee. A foreign production company filmed the works (with King’s consent) while the LINES Ballet was on tour in Europe. “Eight-camera shoots,” King says, “so meticulous and well-crafted.” The Marquee deal is with the outfit that produced them. King gave his blessing to including them in the streaming service’s catalogue, and says he considers it good exposure as well as a public service.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“It’s a library, a bank, for people who would not otherwise see these works,” he says.</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t everyone have access to see art?” King adds. “We are producing ballets nonstop. And you can’t hold everything in. You have to dare. That’s part of how you connect.”</p>
<p>As theaters remain closed, many arts groups have been posting what videos they have on their websites or YouTube channels. But as newsrooms discovered 20 years ago in awkward, ill-prepared migrations from print to digital, a hasty effort with limited reach isn’t a great strategy.</p>
<p>Marquee wants to help.</p>
<p>“It’s really about growing the digital operation for these companies that so badly need it,” Kirschner says. He points to a key reason arts groups need to put their work online: accessibility. It’s a way to invite and hook potential ticket buyers.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“In streaming, we’re giving them that experience in a risk-free environment, to sample an artist they didn&rsquo;t know before,” he says. “If someone likes wine, they need to be able to sample and experiment. That’s not accessible to lots of people at $100 a ticket or more. And what if tickets are sold out or there’s only lousy seats or they don’t have time that evening? The additional burdens are massive.</p>
<p>“The future is live and digital collaborations,” he adds. “We’re an extension of what live organizations do, not a replacement.”</p>
<p>The idea Kirschner and Afanador are promoting to arts groups is this: If Marquee viewers discover and fall in love with, say, Mark Morris’s sumptuous interpretation of the Handel oratorio “L’Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato” (filmed while the Mark Morris Dance Group was touring in Spain), maybe they’ll buy tickets to a live show by the Brooklyn-based group when it comes to their city.</p>
<p>Or, since “L’Allegro” is listed on the Marquee site as part of the “Joyce Theater Collection” — a listing of works by groups that have performed at that New York venue — maybe viewers who like what they see will attend an event at the Joyce next time they’re in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Kirschner says Marquee also aims to share anonymized data on who’s tuning in.</p>
<p>“Presenters working with smaller, contemporary companies are perfectly suited to take advantage of our marketing and data collection, to put people back in their theaters,” he says.</p>
<p>Linda Shelton, the Joyce Theater’s executive director, says her staff worked with Marquee to curate a list of Joyce-affiliated artists from those already featured on the streaming service.</p>
<p>“We want to do everything in our power,” she says, “to stay in the public eye.”</p>
<p>There may be benefits to come, she adds. What if theaters, when they reopen, can sell only half their seats? “If you’re getting your work out there virtually, maybe that’s the other half,” Shelton says.</p>
<p>Perhaps, she suggests, Joyce subscribers could mirror newspaper subscribers, with their access to print and digital versions. For the Joyce, an annual package might include theater tickets plus a digital membership to Marquee.</p>
<p>One thing seems clear: Arts groups appear to have gotten past the initial fear — which feels antiquated at this point, to be sure — that putting work online would take away from ticket sales. No one interviewed for this story expressed concern that streaming “The Barber of Seville” or “The Merchant of Venice” would harm the box office.</p>
<p>“Cinema didn’t take away from theater, and telly didn’t take away from cinema,” says Doran, of the RSC. “Nothing replaces the experience of seeing a live actor on a live stage.”

<h3 id="meet-imperials-new-artist-in-residence">&ldquo;Meet Imperial’s new artist in residence&rdquo;</h3>

Poet and performer Dan Simpson will collaborate with Imperial researchers to create engaging pieces of word-based art inspired by their work.</p>
<p>The Societal Engagement team have appointed Dan Simpson as a poet in residence at Imperial College London. Dan will work with researchers across the College and create innovative ways to engage the public with their work through the art of poetry.</p>
<p>This is going to be an incredibly innovative project, as we take our activities online during lockdown to engage the public in the fascinating work at Imperial. Dan Simpson Poet</p>
<p>Dan Simpson is a writer, performer, producer and educator who creates work that is entertaining, smart, and funny. He has previously been a poet in residence at Waterloo Station and the National Trust and has performed globally, including at Imperial as a roaming poet at an Imperial Lates event.</p>
<p>During his residency, Dan will bring together the arts, the sciences and public perspectives to create work with Imperial researchers and the public. This exchange of ideas aims to allow researchers and the public to understand each other&rsquo;s lived experiences, thoughts about research and what matters to them in a future shaped by COVID-19.</p>
<p>On his residency Dan says, &ldquo;I am thrilled to be in residence at Imperial College London, working to bring their world-leading research to the public through poetry, spoken word, and literature. I can&rsquo;t wait to collaborate with Imperial&rsquo;s scientists to create exciting new art. This is going to be an incredibly innovative project, as we take our activities online during lockdown to engage the public in the fascinating work at Imperial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back to nature</p>
<p>For his first project, Dan will be working with Dr. Ans Vercammen on a publicly crowdsourced poem about our connection with nature. Using this as inspiration, Dan and Ans will co-create a piece of art which combines the crowdsourced words, Ans’ research and personal interests, and Dan’s artistic perspective</p>
<p>Anyone can be part of this project by sending Dan words that relate to their experiences with the natural world – no writing experience needed! Prompts will be shared on social media using the hashtag #VerseResearch.</p>
<p>Why art and science?</p>
<p>An art-science collaboration can yield obvious benefits to the artist: a piece of art inspired by science. But there can be profound benefits to science as well. Applying an artistic lens to research can help scientists see their work differently, likewise the artist is often exposed to new perspectives that may influence their practice when working with scientists.</p>
<p>The Societal Engagement team believe art not only enriches science but opens it up to new audiences who may not consider themselves as “science-y”. Similarly, art-science projects can democratise art by yielding pieces that feel accessible to those who don’t see themselves as “arty”.</p>
<p>Previous art-science collaborations at Imperial include plays about surgery and antimicrobial resistance, visual art representing the Sun’s solar energy and stand-up comedy with researchers at our White City campus. Additionally, the Great Exhibition Road Festival, of which Imperial is a founding partner, is a celebration of art and science that galvanises on the cohabitation of the world-leading art and science institutes on Exhibition Road.

Catherine Johnson</p>
<p>New Narratives is the latest programme from Writing Our Legacy and has been developed in response to the COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Rowena Price “Writing Our Legacy is delighted to announce its new online literary programme New Narratives: We Need to Change the Stories We’re Telling.</p>
<p>“Designed in response to the Covid-19 lockdown, the programme will enable Brighton-based organisation Writing Our Legacy to continue delivering its mission to raise awareness of the contributions of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) writers, poets, playwrights and authors born, living in or connected to Sussex &amp; the South East.</p>
<p>“The programme begins on June 19 and features ‘pay what you can’ online talks, socials, workshops and a retreat, featuring leading names from the literary world, including Dean Atta, Catherine Johnson, and Jacob Ross.</p>
<p>“Writing Our Legacy, in partnership with New Writing South, is also launching a new literary magazine Covert, with a call-out for submissions from writers and artists of colour for the upcoming first edition.”</p>
<p>Lesley Wood, chief executive of New Writing South, said: “Over and over again, with the smallest budget and the biggest heart, Writing Our Legacy brings excellent new work by BAME writers and artists out into the world. Covert magazine is a bold old/new way to showcase some of the UK&rsquo;s most exciting emerging writers whose fresh ideas and strong voices inspire our minds and nurture our souls. New Writing South is proud to support this work and we warmly encourage all writers of colour to submit stories and poems to the magazine.</p>
<p>“Other aspects of the programme include mentoring sessions and a project to distribute Writing Our Legacy’s Hidden Sussex (2019) anthology to universities across the UK. Hidden Sussex is an anthology of poems, prose and short stories from writers of colour who live in or have connections with Sussex.”</p>
<p>Amy Zamarripa Solis, chairman and programme manager for Writing Our Legacy, said: “Now more than ever is it vital for BAME-led arts organisations such as Writing Our Legacy to support our writers, creatives and communities and create safe spaces to come together. We are witnessing the world in a critical situation with global protests against the murder of George Floyd, challenging racism and inequalities in the US and the UK, as well as C-19.</p>
<p>We are also experiencing potential for positive change by working together as a human race. Literature and the arts gives hope and inspiration, gives people new ways of expressing themselves. Our programme aims to unify people of all walks of life together online and shine a light on the amazing writers, musicians and artists we have in Sussex and the South East.”</p>
<p>For details of events and how to book, visit <a href="http://www.writingourlegacy.org.uk">www.writingourlegacy.org.uk</a></p>
<p>The first edition of Covert will open for submissions on July 1 and invites writers of colour to send through original fiction, poetry and art work for this first edition. The theme for the inaugural magazine is Sussex Fortuneteller: What do writers see in the future?</p>
<p>The magazine will be aimed at writers of Black, Asian and ethnic minority background (BAME) living in the South East of England, with an emphasis on supporting Sussex-based writers. We positively encourage writers from marginalised backgrounds to submit.</p>
<p>15 writers will be selected for the publication. Each writer will also receive mentoring and editorial feedback on their writing with a Guest Editor before publication.</p>

<h3 id="pornography-queerness-and-cults-the-world-of-dodie-bellamy">&ldquo;Pornography, Queerness, and Cults: The World of Dodie Bellamy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dodie-copy.jpg" alt="img">
Dodie Bellamy is the kind of writer one knows all or nothing about. When friends asked what I was working on and I said, “Reviewing a collection of essays about Dodie Bellamy’s work,” they responded with either a blank stare or sudden, excited recognition. Tempestuous conversations about Chris Kraus and Kathy Acker arose, along with nostalgic memories of the poet Kevin Killian, Bellamy’s late husband, and the archive-like San Francisco apartment they shared. We discussed the beginnings of New Narrative, a literary movement started in San Francisco in the late 1970s in which Bellamy, Killian, and Acker were key figures. Pornography was a common topic, as was queer identity, transgression, cults, gentrification, and New Age. If someone didn’t know Bellamy, then it was up to me to explain how she strings such topics together and to impress upon them why her writing is still so influential. Ad Policy BOOKS IN REVIEW Dodie Bellamy Is on Our Mind By Jeanne Gerrity and Anthony Huberman (Editors) Buy this book</p>
<p>Dodie Bellamy Is on Our Mind aims to address precisely this. It is a collection of essays written in conjunction with a yearlong celebration of her work by the Wattis Institute at California College of the Arts, presented with a previously unpublished project by Bellamy and Killian. For the past six years, the institute has chosen one artist annually to consider in relation to the question “How does this single artist’s work speak to broader questions about art, culture, and society today?” From September 2018 to August 2019, a group of academics and peers held a select reading group to discuss Bellamy’s work, a discussion which was later opened to the public through a series of monthly events. These included a stage adaptation of a book of e-mail exchanges between Acker and writer McKenzie Wark, an evening of films by legendary underground filmmaker Mike Kuchar, a “manifesto on nothingness” by writer and professor Jack Halberstam threading Bellamy’s work to women’s writing about the domestic, and a reading by Bay Area writers who have studied with Bellamy.</p>
<p>To open the first event, a reading by poet and novelist Andrew Durbin of his essay “Tiny Revolts,” Wattis Institute director and chief curator Anthony Huberman read a selection of Bellamy-specific questions painted on the space’s back wall. “What is new about narrative? Is art ever honest? What is barf art? What does the vulgar have to do with the poetic? Where are the tiny revolts?”</p>
<p>From the resulting essays and events, it’s clear that Bellamy’s work continues to inspire many writers, artists, and filmmakers with an interest in sexuality, progressive politics, and vulnerability. “Even the way that people talk about female desire…. We take it for granted now. In the ’90s we didn’t take it for granted,” recalls the writer Diana Cage, formerly Bellamy’s assistant at Small Press Traffic, the San Francisco bookstore where New Narrative was born. “Dodie is the first place where I actually understood that [female desire] was a thing that needed to be described.”</p>
<p>The three essay authors in Dodie Bellamy Is on Our Mind take distinct approaches. Megan Milks asks, “How does one profile someone who has so thoroughly examined herself?” Milks spends time with Bellamy and others who know her well, including Killian, Cage, the artist Matias Viegener, and Bruce Boone, one of the first New Narrative writers, to define what her work has meant for this creative community. Durbin writes in the collection’s second essay about Bellamy’s use of the personal “I,” a New Narrative strategy that centers the writer’s self and body, and how she places herself within a community to bridge the divide between the personal and political. In the third essay, Kaye Mitchell considers Bellamy’s embrace of vulnerability and vulgarity to examine how her work questions why women are made to feel shame for their femininity and sexuality.</p>
<p>All three circle around crudeness, discomfort, and human imperfection and the way Bellamy’s frankness in probing such topics makes her writing so enticing. Even more enticing is her ability to include gossip, an inherent aspect of the New Narrative writers that, as Durbin observes, presents the author “not only [as] a self, but a self among selves, a self constituted by—and constituent of—a community.” This community is one of gay and queer artists, people from working-class backgrounds, feminists, and activists. By centering the importance of relationships within these largely noninstitutional communities, her work takes a political stance against systems that rely on social assimilation, and alongside those who challenge the norm through even the smallest, most personal acts. Tiny revolts.</p>
<p>Born in North Hammond, Indiana, in 1951, Bellamy grew up in a poor working-class family. A rebel from the beginning, she writes in her memoir the buddhist (2011) that she was precocious as a child.</p>
<p>Over and over on my grade school report cards, one snooty teacher after another wrote “Doris has a bad attitude.” These comments were a source of shame for me, and threats from my mother to stop my damned pouting and behave myself.</p>
<p>In multiple essays, she revisits her strained relationship with her mother and how she felt from a young age that she did not fit in. In Milks’s essay, “Dodie Bellamy’s Crude Genius,” Bellamy uses the word “horrible” to describe her relationship with her father, saying that he was verbally abusive and sexually inappropriate, and that she traces her relationship with obscenity to him. Related Article Mary Gaitskill’s Art of Loneliness Maggie Doherty</p>
<p>Bellamy had her first sexual encounter at age 11 at a sleepover with another girl. She was a “predatory girl who was coming on to all the girls at all the pajama parties,” Bellamy tells Milks. The girls’ relationship morphed into a 15-year codependence, and they eventually joined a cult together, which Bellamy writes about in the essay “Cultured” which appeared in The TV Sutras (2014). “It was a really fucked-up, unhealthy relationship,” she says. Bellamy tried to get out of it for years, and after she finally did at 26, she realized the relationship had stunted her emotionally. “I had never individuated in certain ways,” she says. “If I was upset, I had no inner resources on how to take care of myself.”</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Bellamy left for San Francisco, where she became a core member of the Feminist Writers’ Guild, a group of mostly middle- and upper-class women living in Marin, Berkeley, and San Francisco. She describes meetings on sunny decks where the women fought over how to edit a group anthology, and members burst into tears. “These arguments bored me at the time, as I sat on the floor drunk and stoned, but now I look back on them with awe, the overtness, the trying to work through differences, the belief that classism was bad.”</p>
<p>She started attending classes taught by the feminist poet Kathleen Fraser, who encouraged Bellamy to look into a writing group led by the poet Robert Glück at Small Press Traffic in the Mission District. These weekly workshops became a place for writers who were disillusioned with the then-popular Language Poets, whose work emphasized a stark division between the writer of a piece and its voice. This new group challenged that division, inserting subjectivity into the text and playing with, as Milks writes, “the possibilities of loosely autobiographical storytelling to produce an exploded and unstable ‘I.’”</p>
<p>Bellamy often uses this “I” to blur the boundary between writer and subject. The most fitting visualization of this is her explanation in the buddhist:</p>
<p>Intradiegetic refers to the reality that exists within the narrative of a movie or fiction. The plot, characters, dialogue, etc. Extradiegetic refers to elements that exist outside that narrative. A first person narrator would be intradiegetic, whereas an omniscient narrator would be extradiegetic. The musical score to a film, which presumably the characters can’t hear, would be extradiegetic. If a work is based on something from “real life,” the audience’s pre-existing knowledge of the events would be extradiegetic, as would the audience’s familiarity with the life of the actors…. New Narrative…[is all] about problematizing and confusing the division between intra- and extra- diegetic.</p>
<p>Breaking down the divide between what lies inside and outside a text creates “an illusion of confession,” as Bellamy writes in the essay “Incarnation,” to create “intimacy, sometimes discomfort, in the reader.” She blurs this divide to implicate the reader in a form of intimacy, like a friend trusting you with closest-held secrets.</p>
<p>Gossip plays a similar role as a literary device. It disrupts the divide between the text and what lives outside it, playing with levels of knowledge, intimacy, community, and control. Engaging with gossip places New Narrative works in conversation with one another while destabilizing any “true” course of events. It also knits people together by building a narrative that is told by and for the community. In his essay, Durban cites a definition of New Narrative that Bellamy and Killian provide in their introduction to the anthology Writers Who Love Too Much: “It would be a writing prompted…by community; it would be unafraid of experiment, unafraid of kitsch, unafraid of sex and gossip and political debate.” Durbin ties this definition to the activism that came out of the US government’s failure to respond adequately to the AIDS crisis, which intimately affected many New Narrative writers, and the community bonds that were forged for survival.</p>
<p>As Boone wrote in his seminal essay Century of Clouds (1980), a kind of handbook for New Narrative, “A relation is achieved between the one telling those stories and her or his audience and history…. Let’s say these ‘themes’ become power, friendship, ideology and so on. You want what you write to actually cause these to come to exist, you don’t want to just describe them.” New Narrative writers aimed to bring friendship, power, and community off the page and into the real world. By incorporating gossip, Bellamy’s works move beyond a simple description of a community to the construction of an inclusive organism that is being constantly negotiated and reformed—offering space for writers and artists, even decades later, to engage with..</p>
<p>For Bellamy, gossip went hand in hand with sex, because both offer ways she could locate herself within the world. Huberman writes in Our Mind’s introduction, “She doesn’t write poems or novels about sex but imagines ways the writing itself could contain a sexual force.” Sex and bodily scenes often act as visceral moments that bleed into layers of self-reflection. In one of her best-known essays, “Barf Manifesto,” included in the collection When the Sick Rule the World (2015), she intertwines a critique of her friend Eileen Myles’s essay “Everyday Barf” with an episode in which Bellamy horrifyingly clogs Myles’s toilet with paper towels.</p>
<p>The water finally goes down and I flush and the toilet fills up again with my horrible smelly poo, my shame, and Eileen’s in the doorway barking, keep pumping, pump until all the water’s gone, and I argue that it’s not going to work and Eileen argues that’s what she did in New York, and I’m flopping about and sweating and pumping…. Outside grow all these weird tropical plants imported from Hawaii…. Fake is my word for sure, the way my mom called nonindigenous plants “foreign plants,” she said it with a scowl, “those foreign plants,” which so perfectly sums up the conservative Midwestern America I grew up in, for hours I watched my mother gasp and jerk her head to the left, each breath was like this big event, gasp jerk pause gasp jerk pause and the nurses assured me this was a peaceful cancer death and I believed them–gasping and jerking my mother was at peace–I had to believe them.</p>
<p>Her intimate bodily functions—taking a dump in the privacy of her friend’s bathroom—flow into nonnative flora, dialects and class, US geography, cancer, and death. She sets the scene with her “horrible smelly poo” which she calls “my shame,” a shame we all (likely) know. She uses the scene to reflect on other moments of shame, showing that we all live in bodies that engage in similarly vulgar acts, in a society in which we are socialized to be ashamed.</p>
<p>Mitchell argues in the collection’s third essay that vulnerability and vulgarity are the dual forces that Bellamy uses to express her feminist framework. In the buddhist Bellamy writes, “An in-your-face owning of one’s vulnerability and fucked-upness to the point of embarassing and offending tight-asses is a powerful feminist strategy.” Mitchell puts Bellamy’s writing into conversation with works by Chris Kraus, Marie Calloway, Sophie Calle, and Carolee Schneemann, all of whom have practiced radical vulnerability in their work. Rather than hide shameful female desires and anger, Bellamy exposes them:</p>
<p>To embrace the fucked-up, to move towards a maturity and strength that can include and express weakness and embarrassing content of all sorts without shame, to allow myself the full resonance of being a female subject…living in a fucked up nation, in a fucked up world, in the 21st century.</p>
<p>She expresses, as Cage puts it, the need for female desires to be written authentically, by women. “All the experimental poets who are putting blowjobs into their poems,” says Bellamy, “should understand that that wasn’t always the case.” Because of writers like her, it is now so normal to hear sexual content at a poetry reading that it has become a bit mundane. Vulnerability and sexual content are touchstones of younger generations’ use of the Internet, far beyond what anyone would have anticipated in the era of dial-up. On Twitter, raunchy tweets are just a scroll down from political rants and professional updates. Our posts get all scrambled together into one big cesspool, the good, the vulgar, and the vulnerable—a natural extension of Bellamy’s mix of low and high culture writing and a perhaps natural progression of creative expression to deal with living in such an inherently fucked-up world.</p>
<p>The final piece in the collection is the only one written, at least in part, by Bellamy. It is a collaborative project that she and Killian began when he was diagnosed with cancer. They began to alternate choosing a theme every week—say, “Sylvia Plath” or “drawing”—and together would write 1,000 words. They planned to continue for one year, but after only seven weeks, Bellamy was writing from his hospital room.</p>
<p>The pieces read like conversations between two people who know each other profoundly well. They refer to shared people and history, retelling stories they both know and arguing about the details. They do not address Killian’s precarious health until that seventh week, themed “Now.” Kevin discusses chemotherapy (“I honestly thought that chemotherapy was not going to be a big deal”) and the poetry world (“I realize that the struggles of poetry led me into a hideous depression that wound up giving me cancer”). The piece ends when doctors arrive to insert a breathing tube. We don’t hear from Killian again.</p>
<p>The last two passages are naked, raw vulnerability. Bellamy writes in the first person “I” to “you,” Killian, narrating for him their last few days together. In the final passage, the poets Ariana Reines and Julian Brolaski visit their room, and Reines sings them a song.</p>
<p>Returning to the book’s driving question—“How does this single artist’s work speak to broader questions about art, culture, and society today?”—it is clear that Bellamy’s work, along with Killian’s and other New Narrative writers’, continues to inspire generations of artists to produce work that glories in vulnerability, creating its own kind of community. The final Wattis event for Bellamy, in August 2019, was both a tribute to Killian’s life and the relaunch of a magazine that they began together in 1985, Mirage. The revived magazine is called Mirage #5/Period(ical) and is filled with writing by a new generation of New Narrative–inspired artists. They’ve manifested, through their writing, a community that has grown off the page and into the world.
