<p>Vivian Dsena, who was last seen as Harman Singh in Shakti: Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki, recently revealed about his upcoming projects, the kind of roles he wants to play onscreen, his future plans and more.</p>
<p>Vivian Dsena is one of the finest actors we have in the Indian Television industry, and there”s no doubt about the fact. He has shown his versatility, by portraying different shades in his shows. Whether it was playing an evil vampire in Pyaar Kii Ye Ek Kahaani or playing a romantic hero in Madhubala – Ek Ishq Ek Junoon, Vivian has proved that he can play positive as well as negative roles with utter perfection. And maybe it is the actor’s idea of not playing similar characters onscreen that has made him a ‘fan favourite.’</p>
<p>In a recent chat with the Times India, Vivian revealed that he does not want to stick to playing similar characters onscreen, but he rather wishes to explore and experiment as much as he can. He said that he wants his next character to be different from the last one that he played, and that is the whole idea. He revealed that once a senior person from the entertainment industry told him that his shows become a hit because he does not do the same thing, and brings freshness with each role. He said that in his career of 12 years until now, he played different characters and his formula is to give his fans variety.</p>

<p>The actor was last seen in ‘Shakti – Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki’ opposite Ribina Dilaik. Ask him about the competitiveness on the small screen and Vivian says that he is his own competition. He shared when people ask me if any other actor is his competition, he always says that he is competing with himself. He does not consider himself a perfectionist in any area or field. In fact, his fans call him the ‘king of romance’, but he does not want such things to get into his head. However, he also reveals that it has happened once in his life, and he does not want it to happen again. The handsome hunk says that he just wants to learn new things every day and grow as an actor, and every character that he plays teaches him something different.</p>
<p>When quipped about his upcoming project and when viewers will get to see his magic onscreen again, Vivian revealed that he has a lot of offers coming his way. However, he has not signed anything yet. Just like he mentioned he doesn’t want to play similar characters. He wishes to take up something that is different from what he has already done. He would sign anything only if the character appeals to him.</p>

Image Source : TWITTER Amish Tripathi&rsquo;s new book on legend of King Suheldev hits stands</p>
<p>Mythological-fiction writer Amish Tripathi on Saturday launched his new book — a story about the adventures of the warrior king Suheldev, Westland Publications has announced.</p>
<p>Titled, ”Legend of Suheldev: The King who Saved India”, the book is set in 11th century India, when Mahmud of Ghazni and his Turkic army invaded the country and destroyed the Somnath temple, only to be met with a &ldquo;fierce resistance&rdquo; from king Suheldev.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all culminates in the magnificent Battle of Bahraich, where King Suheldev destroys the Turkic army down to the last man. This is the story of a hero, who fights to defend the motherland, making huge personal sacrifices, displaying glorious leadership, and courage beyond comparison,&rdquo; the publisher said in a statement.</p>
<p>Tripathi said the idea behind writing the book was &ldquo;to bring to national consciousness an inspiring story that has been ignored in the pages of Indian history&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He felt that the story had “particular relevance” in the current times.</p>
<p>“‘Legend of Suheldev’ is the story of a king who united men and women of the nation, irrespective of their religion, caste, region, or status in society.</p>
<p>“An epic adventure, and an inspiring tale of unity, the message of King Suheldev echoes across the chasm of time: when we Indians are united, we are unbeatable,&rdquo; the author of the best-seliing Shiva Trilogy said.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old banker-turned-writer also assured his readers that he continues to work on the fourth book of the Ram Chandra series, the sequel to &ldquo;Raavan - Enemy of Aryavarta”.</p>
<p>The latest book also happens to be the first book from the Immortal Writers&rsquo; Centre, in which a team of writers assist Tripathi in conducting research and preparing the first draft of the book.</p>
<p>The Writers&rsquo; Centre works on Tripathi&rsquo;s idea and a detailed summary to create the first draft, the author then works on it and finalises the manuscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to work with the Immortal Writers’ Centre initiative, that allows us to convert many more story ideas from Amish&rsquo;s mind into books that the world can read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Amish&rsquo;s fans, this book will read like any of his other books. Amish has said often that he has more ideas than the capacity to write, since by himself, he cannot write faster than a book every 1.5 to 2 years,&rdquo; Gautam Padmanabhan, CEO of Westland Publications Pvt Ltd said.</p>

<p>Jagannath Puri Rath Yatra marks Lord Jagannath&rsquo;s annual visit to Gundicha Temple via Mausi Maa Temple (maternal aunt&rsquo;s home) near Saradha Bali, Puri. As part of Ratha Yatra, the deities Lord Jagannath, his elder brother Lord Balabhadra and younger sister Devi Subhadra, along with Sudarshan, are taken out in a procession out of the main shrine of Jagannath Temple and placed in the Ratha (Chariot) which are ready in front of the Temple. This process is called as &lsquo;Pahandi&rsquo;.</p>
<p>9.28 AM: Did you know how Rath Yatra (RathJatra) originated?</p>
<p>Rathajatra (Rath Yatra) is a journey in a chariot (rath) accompanied by the public. Rath Yatra is a procession (journey) of deities. The term - Rathjatra - appears in medieval texts of India such as the Puranas, which mention the Rathajatra of Surya (Sun god), of Devi (Mother goddess), and of Vishnu. Normally, Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra is celebrated by lakhs of devotees accompanying the chariot on its journey to the sanctum sanctorum of Gundicha temple. This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the annual rath yatra is taking place without the devotees.</p>
<p>Ratha-jatra is derived two Sanskrit words, Ratha which means chariot or carriage, and jātrā (yatra) which means journey or pilgrimage.</p>
<p>8.45 AM: Lord Jagannath is being brought to the chariot with priests performing rituals. Lord Jagannath will travel to the Gudicha temple from the Shri Jagannath Temple premises on a 45-feet high Rath pulled by servitors. The Ratha-Jatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha jatra.</p>

<p>The King George&rsquo;s Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow has started anti-body testing, becoming the first medical facility to start this. In the first phase, anti-body testing has been done on 100 health workers and plasma donors.</p>
<p>Senior KGMU doctor, Dr Tulika Chandra said that rapid testing is being done for anti-bodies and the results are available with three to four hours.</p>
<p>This test determines whether a person has anti-bodies needed to fight the virus. Antibody testing is similar to rapid testing where results are declared accurately in a few hours.</p>
<p>Many countries are now testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the population level or in specific groups, such as health workers, close contacts of known cases, or within households.</p>
<p>WHO supports these studies, as they are critical for understanding the extent of - and risk factors associated with - the infection.</p>
<p>Dr Chandra further said that anti-body testing will also be helpful in determining herd immunity in the coming times. It will define how many people in a community have sufficient anti-bodies.</p>
<p>Anti-body testing is particularly focusing on health workers, doctors, and frontline Corona warriors who come into contact with Corona patients.</p>
<p>Uttar Pradesh, at the moment, has 6,186 active Corona cases while the total number of COVID-19 cases is 17, 731 and the number of deaths is 550.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/04/smoking-759.jpg?w=759" alt="img">
During their probe, the agencies stumbled upon Ellora Tobacco Company Limited, which manufactured cigarettes. (Representational) During their probe, the agencies stumbled upon Ellora Tobacco Company Limited, which manufactured cigarettes. (Representational)</p>
<p>Indore-based businessman Kishore Wadhwani, who has been accused of GST evasion to the tune of Rs 233 crore on the illegal sale of gutka and allied products, also evaded tax of about Rs 105 crore by clandestinely manufacturing and supplying cigarettes, the Director-General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) alleged on Monday.</p>
<p>Wadhwani, who also runs a newspaper and a TV channel in Indore, was sent to judicial custody until June 30 by an Indore court after his five-day police remand ended on Monday.</p>
<p>Arrested from a plush hotel in Mumbai last week, Wadhwani was earlier remanded in the custody of DGGI and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) until June 22.</p>
<p>The two agencies have so far found that Wadhawani allegedly evaded tax over the last many years and during the recent lockdown manufactured and supplied gutka and other products from his own manufacturing units, as also from units run by four people who fronted for him. The agencies estimate tax evasion on gutka, other products, and raw material of about Rs 400 crore.</p>
<p>During their probe, the agencies stumbled upon Ellora Tobacco Company Limited, which manufactured cigarettes. The factory on Sanver Road, Indore, had a secret rear exit from where unaccounted for raw material was allegedly brought in and finished goods removed, it was informed.</p>
<p>After the interrogation of factory supervisor, accountant and staff, the agencies estimated that less than 5 per cent of the production was accounted for the last many years. The major buyers even for the accounted production have been found to be fictitious, the Bhopal regional unit of DGGI alleged in a release.</p>
<p>Ellora Tobacco had paid GST of only Rs 2.09 crore, and Rs 1.46 crore had been paid in the last two years, the agency stated. Five more premises connected with the unit were searched in the third week of June, which led DGGI to arrive at the estimate of Rs 105 crore.</p>
<p>The total revenue evasion could be manifold and the extent would be clear only after completion of the investigation, the agency stated in the release.</p>
<p>On June 19, DGGI officials had located an unregistered godown used by the syndicate that involved company directors, transporters, supporting manufacturers and raw material suppliers to conceal packing material containing specific cigarette brands “K10” and “A10”. The material is sufficient to pack 5,000 cartons (each contains 12,000 cigarettes) with an estimated printed MRP of Rs 27 crore, the DGGI said. It said there could be many such godowns in and around Indore. The suppliers of these two cigarette brands confirmed unaccounted supply of about 1500 cartons per month, DGGI said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the DRI had stated that Wadhwani and his associates allegedly violated lockdown and transported illegal consignments of paan masala, tobacco and raw material in Madhya Pradesh and nearby states in vehicles marked “on press duty’’. Five persons, including three who allegedly fronted for Wadhwani by running manufacturing units for him, were arrested.</p>
<p>Indore collector Manish Singh said the district administration didn’t issue press stickers to the newspaper owned by Wadhwani.</p>
<p>The DGGI alleges that Wadhwani laundered huge amount of illicit wealth in cash earned from pan masala/cigarette business by declaring fraudulent sale of newspaper and also booked fictitious advertising income. Unlike the 1.25 lakh declared circulation, the newspaper, investogators say, has a circulation of only 4,000 to 6,000.</p>
<p>Wadhwani’s advocates Abhinav Dhanodkar and Sujay Kantawala denied the allegations. Kantawala said Wadhwani was accused of similar evasions in the past but got a clean chit in 2019.</p>
<p>At Monday’s hearing, Wadhwani’s lawyers claimed he suffers from various ailments and should be admitted to a private hospital.</p>
<p>Special Public Prosecutor Chandan Airan said the medical examination had proved that he did not have the ailments he claimed he had. Airan argued that Wadhwani has a Dubai residence visa and could escape, and if not sent to judicial remand will use his clout to influence the investigation</p>
