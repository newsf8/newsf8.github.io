<p>Julien&rsquo;s Auctions of Beverly Hills is offering a trio of historic Apollo 11 artifacts as part of its Legends &amp; Explorers auction, which takes place on July 17 and 18, 2020. Three of the hand controllers used to steer the famous Columbia Command Service Module (CSM) during the first manned lunar landing mission in July 1969 are expected to fetch between US$80,000 and $200,000 each.</p>
<p>One of the frustrating things about the Apollo 11 mission is that for one of the greatest events in human history, there are very few surviving artifacts from the actual mission that saw the first footprints on the Moon. For this reason, when something like three of the hand controllers that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins used to pilot their moon-ship comes on the market, it certainly draws attention.</p>
<p>Being sold individually, the sale consists of two Rotational Hand Controls (RHC) from the flight stations of Armstrong and Aldrin, and a Translation Hand Control (THC) from Armstrong&rsquo;s. The RHCs look like simple joysticks such as one might see for a game console and the THC looks like a plastic T, but these are the tips of a very deep technological iceberg.</p>
<p>In 1969, these hand controls were the pilot interfaces for what was then the most advanced fly-by-wire system ever made. Their purpose was to override Columbia&rsquo;s autopilot, allowing the astronauts to carry out precise maneuvers like docking with the Lunar Module (LM). Essentially, they perform the same role as the controls for an aircraft but, in the vacuum of space, airfoils were replaced with a collection of reaction control thrusters on the Service Module for maneuvering in flight, while another set in the Command Module were for handling reentry into the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere at the end of the mission after separating from the Service Module.</p>
<p>The Apollo 11 Translation Hand Control Julien&rsquo;s Auctions</p>
<p>The whole system was the result of almost a decade of work. Originally, for the Mercury missions, NASA engineers wanted to use pedals for some of the controls, like on an airplane, but it was soon discovered that the cramped quarters, high g-loads, and spacesuits worn by the astronauts made this impractical, so hand controls were opted for. In addition, the decision was made through the Gemini missions to eliminate all the mechanical control linkages in favor of electronic ones.</p>
<p>Standing about 4.5 in (11.4 cm) tall, the RHC, which sat under Armstrong&rsquo;s right hand, was connected to an electronic control box that&rsquo;s rather bulky by today&rsquo;s standard and consisted of three rotary variable-differential transformers and 18 microswitches. These fed into an equally bulky sheath of control cables, connecting to the CSM&rsquo;s attitude control system. The THC under Mission Commander Armstrong&rsquo;s left hand had a similar arrangement.</p>
<p>By tilting the RHC forward or backwards, Armstrong or the other astronauts from their stations could make Columbia pitch up or down. Tilting the stick left or right caused the craft to roll left or right, and twisting the control made the craft yaw left or right. Meanwhile, the THC moved the craft about in space. Pushing the handle left or right, up or down, propelled the craft along the desired axis, while pushing the handle in or out moved it forward or back. For both controls, how far they were moved throttled the thrusters accordingly. The result was a system of very delicate control with very fast response times for maneuvering in zero gravity, which is very complex and counterintuitive.</p>
<p>The RHC used by Armstrong is expected to fetch between $100,000 to $200,000, as is the RHC used by Aldrin. Meanwhile, Armstrong&rsquo;s THC is expected to bring $80,000 to $100,000. Each comes on a wooden display case with an official NASA removal tag dated September 22, 1969.</p>

<h3 id="dont-want-to-live-with-it-over-my-head-michael-collins-moon-landing-admission-exposed">&ldquo;‘Don’t want to live with it over my head’ Michael Collins’ Moon landing admission exposed&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/151/750x445/1302577.jpg" alt="img">
The legendary astronaut played a pivotal role in getting Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the Moon on July 21, 1969. Dubbed “the loneliest man in the universe” Collins spent 21 hours alone in the command module orbiting the lunar surface while his colleagues stole the show by becoming the first two men to walk on an extraterrestrial body. Just six hours and 39 minutes after the Eagle landed at Tranquility base, Armstrong stepped off the lunar lander and delivered his “one small step” speech before Aldrin joined him 20 minutes later and helped bury the US flag into the surface.</p>
<p>Trending</p>
<p>But, in an interview with NPR 50 years on, Collins said he was not resentful for missing out on the chance to walk on the Moon. Asked if he would have liked the opportunity, he said in 2019: “Absolutely, yes, but am I dissatisfied with the part that I played? Absolutely not. “I had it both ways really. “Sometimes I’ll be walking down, shuffling down the sidewalk after dark and all of a sudden I’ll look up and go ‘woah – I went there one time’.</p>
<p>Michal Collins made a candid admission over the Moon landings</p>
<p>The Apollo 11 crew in 1969</p>
<p>“It takes me by surprise.” Collins said the experience also changed his perspective on Earth. He added: “I usually get asked what the Moon looked like up close and that’s an interesting question with a lot of good answers, but to me, even though I was sitting on its front doorstep, it was nothing compared to Earth. “The Earth was the whole show, even though it was only the size of your thumbnail, you could move your thumb out of the way, but it kept inching its way back into your presence as if it wanted to be looked at and seen. “The first thing is that it was just tiny, tiny against the black velvet background that makes it look more prominent, it’s just a glorious thing, you could sit and watch it all day long.</p>
<p>Buzz Aldrin jumping off the lunar lander</p>
<p>“I could have spent day after day looking at the tiny little Earth.” But, the astronaut went on to admit that he is disappointed in the developments made in space since, adding that he would like to know more about what lies in the cosmos before he dies. He continued: “When someone asks me why we should go into space, I desert the world of facts and figures and come down to the world of emotions. “When I was a kid, I used to lay on my back on the grass at night and see what I could see – most of it I couldn’t understand – that made it all the more intriguing.</p>

The flight controls used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon have gone up for auction in America, where they are expected to fetch up to £160,000 ($200,000) each.</p>
<p>The controls, which look like joysticks from a games console, were used to move the Columbia Command Service Module up, down, left and right as it carried the astronauts to and from the Moon in 1969.</p>
<p>They formed an integral part of the Apollo 11 mission, which marked the first time humans landed on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>The rare artefacts will go under the hammer during the Legends &amp; Explorers auction by Beverly Hills-based Julien&rsquo;s Auctions, set to take place on July 17 and 18.</p>
<p>A trio of controllers will go under the hammer between July 17 and 18 in the US. It includes this rotational hand control</p>
<p>The controls were on the Columbia Command Service Module which and were used to move it up, down, left and right as it made its way to the Moon. The landing was made by the Eagle</p>
<p>Two rotational hand controls (RHC) from the flight stations of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and a translation hand control (THC) from Armstrong&rsquo;s station are in the sale.</p>
<p>Each stands about four and a half inches tall and is mounted in a wooden display case with an Apollo 11 badge and official NASA removal tag.</p>
<p>Their purpose was to override the Columbia&rsquo;s autopilot, allowing the crew to carry out precise manoeuvres such as docking.</p>
<p>The RHCs used by Aldrin and Armstrong are expected to sell for up to £160,000 ($200,000), while the THC used by Armstrong is expected to be purchased for up to £80,000 ($100,000).</p>
<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s and Aldrin&rsquo;s RHCs are also fitted with a trigger switch for activating his headset&rsquo;s microphone.</p>
<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s THC also had the capability to abort the Apollo 11 mission during the initial launch phase if the crew encountered a problem, by turning it counter clockwise.</p>
<p>This is a translation hand control used by Neil Armstrong during the crafts manoeuvres</p>
<p>The controls are to be sold by Julien&rsquo;s Auctions and were an integral part of the Apollo mission</p>
<p>An official NASA audit report has corroborated the authenticity of all three items.</p>
<p>Although the Columbia took the astronauts into orbit around the Moon, they touched down on its surface using the Eagle Lunar Module.</p>
<p>During the mission, the astronauts first blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on the Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>This then detached to allow the Columbia to fly to the Moon, which took three days, before the Eagle headed for its surface.</p>
<p>Baseballs signed by the Apollo 11 crew and original photographs from the mission will also go under the hammer during the auction.

<h3 id="the-apollo-program-how-nasa-sent-astronauts-to-the-moon">&ldquo;The Apollo Program: How NASA sent astronauts to the moon&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qUtLfz6Fj9BLS4FHsoesh4-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
In this Apollo 17 onboard photo, Mission Commander Eugene A. Cernan adjusts the U.S. flag deployed upon the Moon during the December 1972 lunar landing mission, which marked the last of NASA&rsquo;s Apollo Moon landings.</p>
<p>The Apollo program was the name of NASA&rsquo;s project to land humans on the moon in the 1960s and early 1970s. With the success of Apollo 11 in 1969, which put astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time in history, the U.S. was able to declare victory in the space race against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1961, the Apollo program consisted of 11 total spaceflights; four of those tested equipment, and six of the other seven flights landed people on the moon, according to NASA. The first crewed flight occurred in 1968, and the final mission occurred in 1972.</p>
<p>By the time the Apollo missions came to an end, 12 astronauts had walked on or driven over the moon&rsquo;s surface, conducting scientific research and snagging rocks to bring back to researchers on Earth. These samples are still being used to make new discoveries more than 50 years after they were collected.</p>
<p>Related: The Moon on Earth: Where are NASA&rsquo;s Apollo lunar rocks now?</p>
<p>The Apollo program grew out of the space race, a contest that began in 1957 between the capitalist U.S. and communist Soviet Union over superiority in space. With the Russians ahead during the start of the race, U.S. President John F. Kennedy challenged the newly created NASA to land men on the moon and return them safely in his famous 1961 &ldquo;Moon Speech&rdquo; at Rice University in Texas.</p>
<p>Preparation for Apollo came from NASA&rsquo;s Mercury program, which ran from 1959 to 1963 and sent one-person crews into orbit to see if humans could survive and work in space. That was followed by the agency&rsquo;s Gemini program, which ran from 1962 to 1966 and included two-person missions that tested many maneuvers and components critical for landing on the moon.</p>
<p>The Apollo program required a monumental effort, employing roughly half a million people in the United States, according to SpaceFlight Insider. The program cost a total of $28 billion over its lifetime, or approximately $283 billion when adjusted for inflation, according to the Planetary Society.</p>
<p>All Apollo rockets launched from the Kennedy Space Center near Orlando, Florida. (Pictured here is a Saturn V launched during an uncrewed mission, known as Apollo 4.) (Image credit: NASA)</p>
<p>NASA developed several novel vehicles specifically for Apollo, most famously the Saturn V rocket. One of the biggest launch vehicles ever flown, the Saturn V was as tall as a 36-story building and consisted of three stages.</p>
<p>Atop the rocket sat the Apollo command module, a three-person capsule that held the astronauts traveling to the moon and back. The inside of the vessel had about as much room as the interior of a car, making for fairly cramped traveling conditions during the roughly week-long lunar voyages.</p>
<p>Finally, there was the lunar module, which carried two astronauts down to the lunar surface and landed on spindly legs. Once surface excursions were over and astronauts had climbed back inside, the lunar module&rsquo;s top portion fired its engine and ascended to the command module for the return to Earth.</p>
<p>Related: NASA&rsquo;s 17 Apollo moon missions in pictures</p>
<p>The first Apollo tests took place using the Saturn I rocket, a smaller version of the Saturn V that was used to test out the engines and necessary hardware for the program. The first astronauts were set to fly on Apollo 1, but during a launch rehearsal a wiring spark generated a fire that blazed throughout the command module, which resulted in the tragic deaths of the three-person crew.</p>
<p>The failure was a turning point for the program, resulting in extensive redesigns to the command module. It was more than 18 months before NASA tried to send more humans into space again. During that time, the agency launched six uncrewed missions to investigate the performance of the Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>The first successful crewed launch during Apollo 7 marked the next milestone in the program’s history. Though astronauts remained in Earth orbit for its duration, the mission validated the safety of sending people to space using the Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>Apollo 8 was the first mission to send astronauts all the way to the moon, though the crew did not land on its surface, only circled it. During the event, which occurred on Christmas Eve in 1968, the crew took turns reading from the Book of Genesis and snapped the iconic photo of our planet known as &ldquo;Earthrise,&rdquo; which is credited with helping inspire the environmental movement.</p>
<p>The culmination of Apollo was the Apollo 11 mission, when the first astronauts set foot on the moon. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins flew the command module Columbia over it. Armstrong uttered his iconic words, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,&rdquo; as he stepped onto the moon. The astronauts spent 21 hours and 36 minutes on the surface before returning to the command module.</p>
<p>Related: Moon-landing hoax still lives on, 50 years after Apollo 11. But why?</p>
<p>Apollo 13 is remembered as the flight that was saved from near disaster through hard work and clever engineering workarounds. Though the crew never landed on the moon, their travails were dramatized in the award-winning movie &ldquo;Apollo 13&rdquo; about their misadventure.</p>
<p>By the early 1970s, the high price of the Apollo program and waning public interest led to its cancellation. President Richard Nixon and legislators in Congress decided to redirect Apollo&rsquo;s funding elsewhere, like the Vietnam War. Apollo 17 was the final mission of the program, and the first to include a scientist, geologist Harrison &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Smith, who helped identify important rock specimens to bring home.</p>
<p>NASA is currently planning its Artemis program, which is intended to bring people — including female crew members — to the moon for the first time since the end of Apollo. Artemis aims to have its first landing in 2024 and build toward a sustained human presence on the moon by 2028.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief summary of each Apollo mission:</p>
<p>Apollo 1 — Jan. 27, 1967. Astronauts Virgil &ldquo;Gus&rdquo; Grissom, Edward White and Roger B. Chaffee had all been veterans of NASA&rsquo;s Mercury or Gemini programs. A disaster involving the highly oxygenated air inside their capsule and a stray spark, along with the vessel&rsquo;s hatch being difficult to open from the inside, resulted in the death of all three men.</p>
<p>Apollo 4 — Nov. 9, 1967. Uncrewed first launch of NASA&rsquo;s enormous Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>Apollo 5 — Jan. 22, 1968. Uncrewed mission that brought the lunar module to space for the first time.</p>
<p>Apollo 6 — April 4, 1968. Final uncrewed mission of the Apollo program. The launch was designed to test the ability of the Saturn V to inject astronauts into a lunar trajectory. Severe vibrations of the rocket during launch caused the mission to be only partially successful.</p>
<p>Apollo 7 — Oct. 11, 1968. Astronauts Walter M. Schirra, Donn Eisele and R. Walter Cunningham were the first Apollo crew to go into space. Rather than head toward the moon, the astronauts spent 11 days in Earth orbit testing various components of their command module.</p>
<p>Apollo 8 — Dec. 21, 1968. Astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders became the first humans to leave low-Earth orbit, heading on a trajectory that took them around the moon and back to our planet. Their historic flight happened on an accelerated schedule. NASA officials made a last-minute decision to head toward the moon after only a single crewed mission around the Earth in order to quickly demonstrate technological superiority over the Soviet Russians.</p>

<p>Apollo 9 — March 3, 1969. Astronauts James McDivitt, David Scott and Russell &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Schweickart remained in Earth orbit during their 10-day mission, testing out procedures to dock their command module with the lunar module that would be critical for landing on the moon.</p>
<p>Apollo 10 — May 18, 1969. Astronauts Thomas Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan got extremely close to landing on the moon. Their mission involved flying to our natural satellite and bringing the lunar module to within about 50,000 feet (15,000 meters) of the moon&rsquo;s surface, a mission that served as a dress rehearsal for Apollo 11.</p>
<p>Apollo 11 — July 16, 1969. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin E. &ldquo;Buzz&rdquo; Aldrin and Michael Collins did what no humans had ever done before: reach the moon and have two people walk over its surface. Armstrong and Aldrin left historic boot-prints that still remain in the lunar regolith.</p>
<p>Apollo 12 — Nov. 14, 1969. Astronauts Charles &ldquo;Pete&rdquo; Conrad, Alan Bean and Richard Gordon survived two lightning strikes during liftoff and reached a different spot on the moon than Apollo 11, touching down in a place called the Ocean of Storms. Moonwalkers Conrad and Bean visited NASA&rsquo;s Surveyor 3 probe, which had landed on the moon two years prior.</p>
<p>Apollo 13 — April 11, 1970. Astronauts James Lovell, Fred Haise and John Swigert suffered after an oxygen tank exploded 56 hours into their flight to the moon, crippling the mission. The crew was forced to scramble into the lunar module and use it as a lifeboat, circling the moon without landing and then returning safely to Earth. This was Lovell&rsquo;s second time around the moon, the first being on Apollo 8.</p>

<p>Apollo 14 — Jan. 31, 1971. Astronauts Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell and Stuart Roosa are best remembered for having hit golf balls on the moon. Shepard was the first American in space but he and his co-pilots collectively had some of the least flight experience of all the Apollo astronauts, leading them to be lovingly dubbed &ldquo;the three rookies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apollo 15 — July 26, 1971. Astronauts David Scott, James Irwin and Alfred Worden were part of the mission that carried the lunar roving vehicle, often known as the moon buggy, for the first time to the moon. Their mission emphasized geological work, and the crew was trained to identify different rocks and formations that would help scientists on Earth piece together the history of our planet and its natural satellite.</p>
<p>Apollo 16 — April 16, 1972. Astronauts John Young, Charles M. Duke and Thomas Mattingly landed at the Descartes highlands and searched for volcanic rocks during their mission. Confounding scientists&rsquo; expectations, they found few volcanic samples, indicating that the area had not been formed through volcanic action.</p>
<p>Apollo 17 — Dec. 7, 1972. Astronauts Eugene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt and Ronald Evans became the final people yet to ever reach the moon. Their mission continued the focus on science, with the astronauts spending the most time on the lunar surface and picking up the largest samples of any in the program.</p>

<h3 id="apollo-11-vs-the-usb-charger">&ldquo;Apollo 11 vs. the USB Charger&rdquo;</h3>

Computing Really Has Come a Very Long Way</p>
<p>by Jim Turley</p>
<p>“That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” – Neil Armstrong</p>
<p>We all know that computers get faster over time, but it’s sobering to realize just how much faster they’ve gotten.</p>
<p>Next month will mark the 51st anniversary of the first crewed landing on the moon, thanks to the Apollo 11 astronauts and all the engineers and scientists who put them there. By now most of us have heard the story of how lunar module (LM) commander Neil Armstrong had to ignore the onboard computer’s warnings and fly the LM down to the lunar surface when the machine got overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Unlike Gemini capsules, which were flown manually like an airplane, Apollo was fly-by-wire. It was computer controlled, with a combination of input methods including a pilot’s joystick, a calculator-style keypad (a first, since there were no calculators), and fluorescent seven-segment displays controlled by mechanical relays.</p>
<p>The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was state-of-the-art for its time but would be breathtakingly underpowered by today’s standards. It’s not nearly as fast as your laptop, or even your phone – doesn’t matter what phone. It had less computing power than a digital watch. Less than a cable modem or a Wi-Fi card. Less performance, even, than a USB charger.</p>
<p>Programmer Forrest Heller has done a quick analysis of the differences between NASA’s AGC circa 1969 and a couple of different modern USB chargers. His findings? A good USB charger is not just faster than the AGC, it’s more than 500× faster than the computer that took us to the moon and back. Strewth.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the AGC was built using silicon integrated circuits. Real ICs! More than 2500 of them, in fact, each one an identical dual 3-input NOR gate. That’s it. With no other logic, NASA’s engineers had to synthesize all other functions and operations from nothing but 3-input NORs. Those thousands of ICs were wire-wrapped to a passive circuit board. A nearly identical AGC lived in the Apollo 11 Command Module.</p>
<p>Memory was mostly wire-wound magnetic cores. There were 2048 words (about 4KB) of RAM and 36 kilowords of read-only memory for program storage. A “word” meant 15 bits of data plus parity for the memory, but only 14 bits of data, a sign bit, and an overflow bit inside the pure-NOR “processor.” The machine used one’s-complement integer arithmetic; there was no floating-point capability, despite the obvious applications in spaceflight.</p>
<p>The AGC was programmable, of course. It had registers, a program counter, a 12-bit address map, and a fully defined instruction set. It could do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division. It had conditional and unconditional branches (with a one-deep return stack), bitwise logic functions, and lots of timers. It makes the x86 architecture seem positively orthogonal.</p>
<p>Every AGC instruction took at least 12 clock cycles to execute, and often 24 or 36 cycles were needed. Integer division took 72 cycles. There was a low-power standby mode, but it was never used in flight. The machine itself was considerably bigger than a shoebox and weighed about 70 pounds in its metal case. Keypad sold separately.</p>
<p>The AGC ran at a 1024-KHz (1.024 MHz) clock frequency, which works out to around 1 microsecond per cycle, or more than 11 microseconds for even the quickest instructions.</p>
<p>Compared to that, Anker’s $49 USB charger has one of Cypress Semiconductor’s CYPD4225 USB-C microcontrollers, which is based on a Cortex-M0 CPU running at 48 MHz. Right off the bat, the USB charger enjoys nearly a 48× improvement in clock speed. More significant, however, is the fact that Cortex-M0 executes most instructions in a single cycle, not dozens of cycles like the AGC. Assuming that ARM instructions are more or less equivalent to AGC instructions – and they are – that works out to well over a 500:1 ratio in performance.</p>
<p>The USB charger also has twice as much RAM and nearly twice as much ROM. On the other hand, 32-bit ARM instructions take up more memory space than AGC’s 16-bit words, so we could argue that the USB charger has less effective ROM space. “Going to the moon on 8KB sounds hard,” Heller points out.</p>
<p>I don’t know which is more impressive: that we sent people to the moon and back with so little computing power, or that we’ve improved so radically since then. Fortunately, we don’t have to choose. Both are real.

<h3 id="por-que-os-astronautas-da-apollo-11-ficaram-em-quarentena">&ldquo;Por que os astronautas da Apollo 11 ficaram em quarentena?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://aventurasnahistoria.uol.com.br/media/_versions/estados_unidos/apollo1dnn_widelg.jpg" alt="img">
Ao voltarem para casa, os responsáveis pelo grande passo da humanidade viveram em isolamento por um tempo</p>
<p>Alexandre Carvalho Publicado em 29/06/2020, às 12h31 - Atualizado às 12h32</p>
<p>Parece enredo de ficção científica. Bactérias assassinas, que habitam as crateras da Lua, chegam ao nosso planeta a bordo de uma espaçonave (terrestre), desencadeiam um contágio descontrolado e&hellip; pronto: é o fim da aventura humana na Terra.</p>
<p>Hoje, sabe-se, não há nenhuma forma de vida na Lua. Mas ninguém tinha certeza disso em 1969, quando a missão Apollo 11 voltava para casa depois daquele grande salto da humanidade, que foi colocar americanos em solo lunar.</p>
<p>E se, inocentemente, os astronautas trouxessem consigo germes selenitas, perigosos para o organismo humano? Por mais que a hipótese não parecesse crível, a Nasa decidiu se precaver.</p>
<p>E tinha suas razões: um vírus alienígena circulando nos EUA arruinaria toda a imagem de vencedor da corrida espacial contra a União Soviética. Para garantir, o governo americano decretou, a toque de caixa, a Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law (“Lei para Exposição Extraterrestre”), uma política de “responsabilidade e autoridade para proteger a Terra contra qualquer contaminação prejudicial”.</p>
<p>Na prática, essa lei significava a velha e prudente quarentena medieval – que viajou num túnel do tempo até a época das odisseias espaciais. E assim foi: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin e Michael Collins tiveram de permanecer 21 dias confinados numa instalação construída para a quarentena, uma espécie de trailer modificado.</p>
<p>Responsável pelas operações médicas da Apollo 11, o cirurgião Charles Berry justificaria a precaução numa entrevista 30 anos depois: “Se os astronautas tivessem qualquer coisa, uma tosse, uma fungada, nós teríamos de provar que isso não tinha vindo da Lua”.</p>
<p>A lei deixou de valer em 1977, quando já estava claro que não havia nenhum microorganismo na Lua. Mas a quarentena continuou a ser praticada pela Nasa – mas, agora, antes da partida.</p>
<p>Todos os astronautas são obrigados a passar um período confinados para garantir que nenhum deles fique doente durante a missão. Imagine ter uma pneumonia a 300 mil quilômetros de qualquer médico da Terra&hellip;

<p><img src="https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/36/5363a42a-b709-11ea-b1cc-335f45f30260/5ef4df3a31c89.image.jpg?crop=990%2C557%2C0%2C51&amp;resize=990%2C557&amp;order=crop%2Cresize" alt="img">
Buffalo Games is ready to launch a new board game tied into the Apollo missions.</p>
<p>What made the project special was, Buffalo Games worked with NASA and received the space agency&rsquo;s blessing and insights.</p>
<p>Just as Buffalo Games learned with its jigsaw puzzles, it&rsquo;s a good time to be in the board game business. People stuck at home are looking for creative diversions.</p>
<p>Most of Buffalo Games&rsquo; board games are manufactured overseas. But the Buffalo-based company&rsquo;s employees think up and develop the game ideas here.</p>
<p>Buffalo Games had mostly wrapped up its work on the Apollo game when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, so its development wasn&rsquo;t really affected, said John Bell, the company&rsquo;s design director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s proven is whether it&rsquo;s puzzles or games, is people are hungry for play,&rdquo; Bell said. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s on the game table or the puzzle table, the appetite is there. It&rsquo;s just how you bake in some new innovation and really create something that&rsquo;s going to be an experience for everyone involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buffalo Games for some time had its eye on a game with a space exploration theme, Bell said. Last year, there was buzz around the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission that brought humans to the lunar surface for the first time.
