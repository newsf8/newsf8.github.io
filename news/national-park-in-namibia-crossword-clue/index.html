<p>With its bone-dry grasslands and oppressive heat, the middle of the Namib Desert may seem like a strange place to go fishing. Yet there Jennifer Guyton and Tyler Coverdale were, standing in a sea of orange sand and brittle yellow grass with their 30-foot carp pole.</p>
<p>But the two Princeton graduate students weren’t trying to catch some sort of desert-dwelling dogfish or a literal “sand shark.” That would be absurd. Instead, they had swapped the hook with a camera so they could investigate the scenery around something much more scientifically sensible: fairy circles.</p>
<p>That is what scientists call the mysterious bald spots speckled across Namibia’s grasslands. The rings are six feet to 115 feet wide and are regularly spaced out in a hexagon or honeycomb pattern. As their ethereal name would imply, fairy circles have long bewildered researchers as to their origins. But a new study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature that Ms. Guyton and Mr. Coverdale were involved in seeks to offer some insights into how the enchanting landscapes may have formed.</p>
<p>Although the name fairy circles sounds sweet and peaceful, there is passionate scientific disagreement over how they arise, and the two prevailing hypotheses have become adversaries in the dispute.

<h3 id="8-of-the-best-safari-destinations-in-africa">&ldquo;8 of the best safari destinations in Africa&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180627141645-eight-top-safari-destinations---uganda-kidepo-mark-eveleigh-01-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) — With so many spectacular game reserves to choose from, determining the ultimate once-in-a-lifetime African safari experience is no easy task for travelers.</p>
<p>From Tanzania&rsquo;s protected Serengeti National Park, to Botswana&rsquo;s brutally wild Kalahari Desert, here&rsquo;s our pick of eight of the finest national parks Africa has to offer.</p>
<p>Serengeti National Park, Tanzania</p>
<p>Serengeti National Park is Africa as you always imagined it, a pristine landscape of swaying savannah, dotted with flat-topped acacia and speckled with great roving herds.</p>
<p>The Serengeti is the setting for the Great Migration (normally from June to July and January to February,) considered the greatest wildlife spectacle on earth when over two million wildebeest, zebra and gazelle chase the rains.</p>
<p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this area offers the same sort of phenomenal predator sightings that you&rsquo;d expect from the neighboring Masai Mara National Park in Kenya (part of the same ecosystem,) but lion and cheetah chases at Serengeti are often enjoyed without another vehicle in sight.</p>
<p>Some visitors might be frustrated by the great expanses of plains to be covered between sightings, but the feeling of being just a dot in the immensity of Africa is part of the appeal.</p>
<p>For first-timers: Safari novices might want to consider starting their Tanzania trip with a day or two at Ngorongoro Crater, where the Big Five (lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino and leopard) are often all visible in a single morning&rsquo;s game drive. After that the pressure is off &ndash; they can sit back and take the thrill of the Serengeti as a bonus.</p>
<p>For old hands: Allow more time for the Serengeti to really get under your skin and head for the less visited areas near Namiri Plains or around the Grumeti River. An often-overlooked alternative to the Serengeti is Tanzania&rsquo;s : Allow more time for the Serengeti to really get under your skin and head for the less visited areas near Namiri Plains or around the Grumeti River. An often-overlooked alternative to the Serengeti is Tanzania&rsquo;s Selous Game Reserve , which offers world class lion and painted dog (or wild dog) sightings.</p>

<p>Kidepo Valley National Park, Uganda</p>
<p>Kidepo Valley National Park boast at least 86 mammal species. Mark Eveleigh</p>
<p>Kidepo Valley National Park might be the most beautiful park in all Africa.</p>
<p>With the sweeping plains of Kidepo and Narus Valleys overshadowed by the brooding mountainscape of Mount Morungole (the sacred peak of the mysterious Ik people,) this park has huge appeal just for scenery alone.</p>
<p>Tag on incredible animal sightings and tiny visitor numbers, and you have a winner.</p>
<p>The voracious Kidepo lions prey on roving herds of more than 4,000 buffalo (the total population in the park is said to be about 13,000) and you will often see herds of elephants moving majestically along the valleys.</p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s isolation is off-putting for many, but the 12-hour road trip from Kampala, Uganda&rsquo;s capital, (or a fairly expensive private charter flight) is a small price to pay to discover one of Africa&rsquo;s genuine hidden gems.</p>
<p>For first-timers: If the journey to Kidepo is not appealing, Murchison Falls National Park is hard to beat for the sheer drama of the falls themselves and for the easy wildlife viewing from cruise boats.</p>
<p>For old hands: Even for those who&rsquo;ve seen everything else that Africa has to offer, Uganda is perhaps the best destination on the planet for ape watching. Gorilla viewing at Even for those who&rsquo;ve seen everything else that Africa has to offer, Uganda is perhaps the best destination on the planet for ape watching. Gorilla viewing at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is a life changing experience and chimpanzees can be tracked on foot at Kaniyo Pabidi.</p>

<p>Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe</p>
<p>Hwange is Zimbabwe&rsquo;s biggest national park, covering more than 14,600 square kilometers. Mark Eveleigh</p>
<p>Hwange National Park is arguably the most underrated wildlife park in Africa.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s biggest national park (with almost the same land area as Hawaii) is said to boast a greater diversity of mammals (108 species) than any other national park in the world.</p>
<p>It has the greatest concentration of big land animals anywhere on the planet, yet sees so few tourists that the vast elephant population (roughly 46,000) outnumbers foreign visitors by almost 200 to one.</p>
<p>Hwange is also prime predator territory with &ldquo;super prides&rdquo; numbering more than 20 lions (powerful enough even to hunt young elephants,) hyenas, leopards and the enchanting painted dogs.</p>
<p>For first-timers: Combine with a lakeside vacation at Lake Kariba or an introductory safari at Zambezi National Park which, despite its diminutive size, offers a chance to see elephant, giraffe, buffalo, hippo, crocs and even lion within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the legendary Victoria Falls.</p>
<p>For old hands: has incredible density of wildlife and (guided or unguided) canoeing and walking activities provide a burst of adrenalin for even the most dedicated wilderness thrill seeker. Mana Pools National Park has incredible density of wildlife and (guided or unguided) canoeing and walking activities provide a burst of adrenalin for even the most dedicated wilderness thrill seeker.</p>

<p>Samburu National Reserve, Kenya</p>
<p>Often overshadowed in the minds of visitors by the celebrated Masai Mara, Samburu National Reserve offers a wilder side of the Kenyan safari experience.</p>
<p>The Samburu people (frequently confused with their southern cousins, the Maasai) offer a similarly colorful cultural appeal in what was once Kenya&rsquo;s Northern Frontier District, but few villages see many visitors and the Samburu&rsquo;s sense of hospitality remains legendary.</p>
<p>Apart from the premier league wildlife sightings that draw most visitors to southern Kenya, Samburu National Reserve is also home to an impressive &ldquo;second division&rdquo; which local guides call the Samburu Special Five (featuring Beisa oryx, reticulated giraffe, Grevy&rsquo;s zebra, Somali ostrich and the elegant gerenuk antelope.)</p>
<p>For first-timers: The Masai Mara National Reserve &ndash; sometimes called &ldquo;the greatest wildlife real estate on Earth&rdquo; &ndash; is a must-see sight for any wildlife fan.</p>
<p>Rather than placing an emphasis on staying at a camp in the center of the (unfenced) park, it&rsquo;s worth considering staying on a private concession which can offer experiences such as walking safaris and night drives featuring the same wildlife but with a level of exclusivity rarely found in the heart of the world-famous Mara.</p>
<p>For old hands: The 150-kilometer long Matthews Range is barely known, yet this jungle-clad &ldquo;island in the sky&rdquo; has been described as a &ldquo;biological bonanza,&rdquo; a place where you can walk in the presence of lions, buffalo and the world&rsquo;s densest concentration of melanistic black panthers.</p>

<p>Kalahari Desert, Botswana</p>
<p>Kalahari Desert covers most of Botswana as well as parts of Namibia and regions of South Africa. Mark Eveleigh</p>
<p>Traditionally known to the San Bushmen as Kgalagadi, The Great Thirstland, the Kalahari Desert represents Africa at its most brutally wild.</p>
<p>The 52,800-square-kilometer-long Central Kalahari Game Reserve is a challenge to access and, because of the aridity, wildlife tends to be more spread out than in the other great parks in the region.</p>
<p>This is a land of pure adventure, however, and encountering herds of majestic gemsbok on the shimmering mirages of Deception Valley or camping amid the guttural roar of the local lion pride near Tau Pan (meaning Lion Pan) is sure to provoke a feeling of privilege.</p>
<p>There are no facilities in the reserve you need a tour operator with experience in leading 4x4 convoy to access this region.</p>
<p>The logistical complications are invariably amply rewarded, however, by the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
<p>For first-timers: For an insight into the diversity of Africa, there&rsquo;s nothing better than a two-stop safari combining the shimmering pans of the Kalahari with Okavango wetland wilderness. For an insight into the diversity of Africa, there&rsquo;s nothing better than a two-stop safari combining the shimmering pans of the Kalahari with Okavango wetland wilderness. Moremi Game Reserve probably presents the most convenient safari option (along with prodigious wildlife) in the delta.</p>
<p>For old hands: Northern Tuli Game Reserve is one of unknown gems of Southern Africa. On offer is mountain biking, walking and even horseback riding through stunning landscapes of the mopane and fever tree forests, watching herds of up to 400 elephants and enjoying what might be the best leopard sightings in the world.</p>

<p>South Luangwa National Park and Kafue National Park, Zambia</p>
<p>South Luangwa was established as a National Park in 1972. Pixabay / Creative Commons</p>
<p>South Luangwa National Park (Zambia&rsquo;s wildlife flagship) is a firm favorite with many dedicated safari buffs for its uncrowded wilderness combined with a spectacular concentration of wildlife.</p>
<p>Meanwhile giant Kafue National Park, which is twice its size, draws safari connoisseurs with its phenomenal lion and leopard sightings and incredible diversity of antelope species, many of which are rarely seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>With the exception of rhino, the Big Five are relatively common fixtures here. Lions and cheetah often seen hunting on the Busanga Plains and you have a chance to spot leopards and painted dogs from a boat on the Lufupa River.</p>
<p>Zambia (along with Zimbabwe) is known for some of the best guides in the business and walking safaris and night drives are activities you can enjoy here that rarely feature in national parks in other areas.</p>
<p>For first-timers: Even in Africa, good things sometimes come in small packages. Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park (one of Zambia&rsquo;s smallest) is more of a sanctuary than a park, yet it boasts the Big Five and a lot more besides. Visitors can even walk among white rhino.</p>
<p>For old hands: Lower Zambezi National Park offers heart-stopping views of hippos and huge crocs from the vantage point of a canoe on the mighty Zambezi River.</p>

<p>Etosha National Park, Namibia</p>

<p>While Namibia falls short from its neighboring countries for sheer wildlife density, it does offer wonderful sightings of desert species, along with perhaps the best chance to watch the region&rsquo;s iconic cheetah in fleet-footed action.</p>
<p>Etosha National Park is undoubtedly the star of the country&rsquo;s wildlife line-up, but it can get busy during the dry season (from July to September) when the wildlife concentrates closer to the waterholes.</p>
<p>Affordable camps and well-maintained roads and tracks make this one of the best options for self-drive safaris, and floodlit waterholes (like Okaukuejo in the southwest) offer an unusual opportunity to watch lions, hyena and even black rhino at night.</p>
<p>For first-timers: is named after the many shipwrecks that form a lacework of tangled iron along the eerie 500-kilometer stretch of windblown desert dunes. Rather than a classic wildlife park, the Skeleton Coast offers a unique opportunity to see immense colonies of up to 100,000 Cape-fur seals, along with herds of migrant desert animals.

<p>For old hands: Zambezi Region (formerly known as : Zambezi Region (formerly known as Caprivi Strip ) provides a crossing point for wildlife from Namibia, Zambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe but it is a challenging safari, best undertaken in a convoy of 4x4s.</p>

<p>Kruger National Park, South Africa</p>
<p>All of the Big Five animals can be found at Kruger National Park. Pixabay / Creative Commons</p>
<p>The gigantic Kruger National Park (about the same size as Israel or Wales) is big enough to offer something for everyone.</p>
<p>With diverse wildlife, including the Big Five (with an estimated 1,500 lions but heavily threatened rhinos,) Kruger&rsquo;s excellent road network means that most areas are accessible even with two-wheel drive vehicles.</p>
<p>Often derided for being &ldquo;tame wilderness&rdquo; because of tarred roads and good infrastructure, this huge park measures 414 kilometers from Crocodile Bridge in the south to Pafuri Gate in the north &ndash; for added wilderness appeal it is recommended to head farther into the less-visited tracks and trails of the north.</p>
<p>For first-timers: For the independent traveler with a hired vehicle, Kruger is arguably the cheapest and most accessible of all Africa&rsquo;s major parks. : For the independent traveler with a hired vehicle, Kruger is arguably the cheapest and most accessible of all Africa&rsquo;s major parks. Sabi Sand Game Reserve shares a 50-kilometer unfenced border with Kruger National Park and it benefits from incredible wildlife viewing (along with possibly the best leopard spotting in the world.)</p>
<p>For old hands: Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal offers some of the best cheetah sightings, huge leopards, a rare chance to see both the black and white rhinos and a bird list of well over 400 species.

<h3 id="hunt-elephants-to-save-them-some-countries-see-no-other-choice">&ldquo;Hunt Elephants to Save Them? Some Countries See No Other Choice&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/05/science/05SCI-HUNT-6/05SCI-HUNT-6-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Yet many experts also believe that the proceeds from hunting are all that prevents many poor communities from turning against local wildlife.</p>
<p>“While the noise in the press is all about morals and entitled white men killing innocent animals to hang obnoxiously on their wall — all of which I agree with — this actually has very little to do with pragmatic conservation,” said Brian Child, an ecologist at the University of Florida.</p>
<p>“Like everything else in life, it’s all about the money — money to combat illegal wildlife trade, and money to prevent the much more serious problem of wildlife’s replacement by the cow or the plow.”</p>
<p>Critics of big-game hunting seldom offer viable alternatives for the communities that rely on these funds to protect wildlife, Dr. Child said. Nor do the countries that issue trophy bans typically provide financial assistance sufficient to make up for the shortfall when hunting income goes away.</p>
<p>Hunters pay $65,000 to $140,000 to hunt lions in Zimbabwe, for example; an elephant hunt can run $36,000 to $70,000. (The price would be higher were it not for the American trophy ban.)</p>
<p>“Zimbabwe is on its knees because of economic downturn, yet the international community expects our poor country to look after elephants and lions when we can’t even feed our nation,” said Victor Muposhi, a zoologist at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe.</p>

Glenn Babb says the NP foreign minister was the wrong man, pursuing the wrong policy</p>
<p>THE HOLLOWNESS OF THE NATIONAL PARTY FOREIGN POLICY AND THE HOLLOW MAN THAT PURSUED IT - PIK BOTHA, AN ASSESSMENT</p>
<p>“No man is a hero to his valet”</p>
<p>Anne-Marie Bigot de Cornuel {1605-94}</p>
<p>More than a year has passed since Pik Botha’s death and the claque of praise-singers has become a distant echo. By his overwhelming personality and theatrical persuasion, Pik for 17 years reigned over the National Party’s foreign policy.</p>
<p>He got the name “Pik” from being cheerleader (rasieleier) at the University of Pretoria’s intervarsity rugby sing-song, wearing swallow-tails and white bow-tie, looking like a penguin (pikkewyn), hence Pik. This role suited him and for his full career he was rasieleier, always looking for the limelight, wanting to be, as someone said on his death, “the bride at every wedding and the cadavre at every funeral”.</p>
<p>He made his name in the foreign service at the South West Africa case in 1966 at The Hague. Pik had been given the task of drawing up the memorials for the legal team proving that South Africa was fulfilling its Mandate responsibility of promoting the welfare of South West Africa’s local population. This was the thrilling part of his career – he recounted without end how he had slept under the proofs at Cape Town Printers, how he had pretended that the Prime Minister’s office had given approval for delaying the SAA flight to Amsterdam and how he sped to Jan Smuts Airport with police escort to get the memorials to The Hague in time.</p>
<p>The memorials were not needed in the end because the President of the Court, Sir Percy Spender, refused to apply teleological interpretation to the South West Africa Mandate and decided that Ethiopia and Liberia had no locus standi to bring the action and dismissed it.</p>
<p>As a reward, Pik was made head of a new section, Legal and UN, to which I was transferred from Protocol where I was arranging dog licences for diplomats, paying back excise duty on petrol and having the Pretoria municipality quash traffic tickets for the corps. I had written a memo on de iure recognition of Rhodesia and this came to Pik’s attention.</p>
<p>Pik was bored and ignored so when National Party delegations came to persuade him to stand for parliament in Wonderboom against the dreaded Herstigte Nasionale Party, he agreed and went to Parliament before being appointed in 1974 Permanent Representative to the UN andambassador to Washington.</p>
<p>The post-Republic Foreign Minister had been the anti-Semite, Eric Louw, who coined the phrase “South Africa, the polecat of the world”. His reaction to South Africa’s isolation was to pen a book The Case for South Africa which railed against other states whose human rights record (India, Canada, Australia) were allegedly more hypocritical than South Africa’s. He was followed by Hilgard Muller who was genuinely hurt at how rude the world could be. Then came Pik. Much was expected: he had said that South Africa should buy into the principles of the UN Human Rights.</p>
<p>That was a false dawn – Pik continued right where his predecessors left off.</p>
<p>Pik had put himself forward as an African: “African solutions for African problems”, he said and, bizarrely, in Brazzaville: “Africa must build its own cars and refrigerators&hellip;” Yet Pik was never comfortable in the company of Blacks – only two of significance attended his funeral: Bantu Holomisa and Moeletsi Mbeki. No African or international politicians came.</p>
<p>Getting the West to protect the Laager</p>
<p>To Black Africans, he was alternatively patronising (George Matanzima), hostile (Afonso Dhlakama), disdainful (President Abdallah), dismissive (Abdouldaye Wade) or smarmy (Mobutu Sese Seko) – and he could be downright rude towards petty officials (customs officials in Botswana).</p>
<p>It was to the chanceries of Europe or the beltway of Washington that he turned for salvation. This was the hollow and ultimately failing foreign policy he pursued for two decades. For this, he gathered around him a cabal of like-minded officials who became known as the “Washington mafia” and who fell happily into Pik’s slipstream as suave mediocrities. They preferred the luxury hotels of Europe and the US and durably remained holding the reins of this doomed policy.</p>
<p>They consisted of Neil van Heerden, Derek Auret, Herbert Beukes, a man who struggled to speak English and had the air of a mortician and, then, outriders, the uncommunicative Johan Kilian and, later, Leslie Manley.</p>
<p>Chester Crocker counted Pik Botha amongst the Cabinet Ministers he would not like to meet in a back alley on a dark night according to his book, High Noon in Southern Africa: Making Peace in a Rough Neighborhood. Pik’s coterie shared a deficiency: none of them spoke foreign languages except van Heerden who spoke some German.</p>
<p>It should have been clear to Pik and the cabinet he served , that our saviour would not be the West. The sanctions, the hostility and the boycotts started in Africa. Despite this blindingly obvious fact, South Africa’s policy accepted African resistance as a given and turned counter-intuitively to the West. Where should your foreign policy be concentrated? Answer 101: sensibly on Africa.</p>
<p>Pretty well all the resources went on endeavouring to convince the Western powers to stick with South Africa’s government. This was a failing and pessimistic policy. There is logic in trying to keep major trading partners on side, but aiming all your rescue remedy there is like putting Elastoplast on war wounds.</p>
<p>This policy was doomed. It was asking allies to help keep the barbarians from the gates, it was retreating again into the laager. It could not succeed and, in their hearts, our Ministers and in particular, Pik, knew it. That is why, impressed with Masada in Israel, where the Romans had pinned the Israelite resistance till they committed suicide, he ruminated : “This is what the Afrikaner should do – resist until suicide.” It seems his romantic projection for the embattled Afrikaners is ominous and can partially be blamed on his policies.</p>
<p>He personally wrote the speech challenging the world at large towards the end of the National Party reign, to be addressed to the UN: “Do your damnedest!” read by the underwhelming Leslie Manley.</p>
<p>In 1985, he summoned heads of mission to Pretoria for a debriefing. His part in this debriefing was astonishing. At the government guest house he stormed in, stood on the landing and thundered at us: “You have been sent abroad to promote this country – you must do it aggressively. You must confront governments that oppose us even if you’re declared persona non grata. I won’t tolerate inactivity. I expect you to go out and show strength of will. If you are not prepared to, you can ask to be recalled or I’ll recall you.”</p>
<p>He stormed out again.</p>
<p>This implied that, as cheerleader, he had nothing more to cheer about and no-one to lead. The policy had unravelled. The rasieleier showed that cheerleader was all he was and that the intervarsity was coming to a whimpering end.</p>
<p>Venture into the Interior</p>
<p>At an early stage (1961), with enough self-confidence, South Africa could have taken a pro-active approach on the Congo where the half-mad Irishman, UN rep’s Conor Cruise O’Brien, as an Irish Unionist opposed to separatism, used troops to kibosh Tshombe’s party, COTAKAT, which wanted Katanga to secede from the Congo.</p>
<p>South Africa, which was the route for Katanga exports needed forcefully to insist the results of the Katanga election legitimised Tshombe – but our role remained passive and we even withdrew our Consul from Leopoldville.</p>
<p>Leaving the Commonwealth hampered a true Africa policy and by the time Pik became Minister in 1978, it had become an axiom that Africa, the cause of isolation, was irredeemably fixed in enmity.</p>
<p>But was it? The SADF and National Intelligence had a much more pragmatic conception of Africa.</p>
<p>In 1963, when the Organisation of African Unity came into existence, early resolutions were firstly, that frontiers of the Berlin Conference (1885) should be sacrosanct, thereby seeking to eliminate separatist movements in Katanga and Biafra, and secondly, that South Africa should be excluded and sanctions imposed.</p>
<p>Both were fateful decisions. One was a recipe for wars that continue to plague the continent. The effect of the second was that SAA had to fly around the bulge, South Africans could not get visas, ports were closed to South African ships and goods were boycotted.</p>
<p>These resolutions were not unanimously accepted. One opposing the sanctions was Ivory Coast, whose president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, the “sage” of Africa, regarded it as folly to exclude the powerhouse of Africa and politically stupid not to dialogue with the white Africans. Mauritius ignored it. Some countries that took independence after 1963, like Malawi, did not buy into this ideology. Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana, locked into the Southern African Customs Union, were unable to.</p>
<p>By the time Pik became Minister, many African states had buyer’s regret and a growing number put out feelers on multiple levels. We started a ranch in Gabon and co-operated with its mining company, COMILOG, in marketing manganese, the Defence Force helped Mobutu against the Simba rebels, PW Botha as Defence Minister had good relations with King Hassan of Morocco, we started farms in Equatorial Guinea and the Comores and placed DFA personnel on the ground, our planes landed in Cape Verde, National Intelligence had outposts including Togo, the Deputy President of Somalia, Ali Samatar, visited South Africa and official delegations visited Mogadishu. The President of the Comoros, where the SADF had a listening post made an official visit. Jonas Savimbi even said to Jean-Yves Ollivier that the Afrikaners were “les vrais sauvages d’Afrique”, (the true savages of Africa) meant in the most complimentary way.</p>
<p>At Pik’s appointment, the time was ripe for a recalibration of our Africa policy. This was strongly resisted by the Washington mafia – at the management meeting in which I set out planned relations with Equatorial Guinea, Herbert Beukes scoffed heavily.</p>
<p>They found delectation in the hotels of Europe and America while Bula Nyati (Zaire PM), Idi Nadhoim (Comoros VP), Ali Samatar (Somalia VP) and Hervé Duval (Foreign Minister, Mauritius) were content to lodge in my house in Kensington, Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Where South Africa had been openly welcomed in African countries this was not exploited. The Central African Republic under President Jean-Bédel Bokassa had contracted Anglo-American’s LTA to build a hotel in Bangui guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Corporation.</p>
<p>After Bokassa’s overthrow in 1979, President Joseph Kolingba’s successor government approached South Africa to complete the hotel. Pik’s reaction was: “For me, that hotel can stand like a piece of Meccano in the middle of Africa.”</p>
<p>Pik an Africanist?</p>
<p>Africa was always an also-ran for Pik. In contrast to his public pronouncements on Africa, he gave the Washington mafia full rein for the use of resources and personnel to convince Western influentials to oppose sanctions.</p>
<p>A budget of millions was established for this. Fortunes went through Herbert Beukes’ embassy in Washington to improbably named lobbyists like Shipley, Smoak, Henry and Holdgreiwe. As media groupie, Pik derived immense pleasure from being photographed in the company of Franz-Josef Strauss of Bavaria, with whom he went shooting, with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and these photos adorned the walls of his office (no Africans though); but when President Abdallah of the Comores came on an official visit he did not attend the banquet.</p>
<p>He was frivolous and dismissive of Africa efforts. After more than a year of hard work and negotiation, we had managed to get President Siad Barre (Somalia) to allow SAA overflights to (of all places) Israel. The delegation I put together consisted of the head of the SA Reserve Bank, Simon Brand, SAA’s head, Gert van der Veer, SADF brasshats, National Intelligence and Pik.</p>
<p>Pik saw this as a way to reward Albert Vermaas, on whose game farm he hunted, by hiring Vermaas’ private planeto get to Mogadishu. Then, while staying at the OAU village waiting for President Barre, Pik thought it a source of amusement to go with his sheath knife and electric razor to the bazaar to barter them for amber.</p>
<p>Always surrounded by Somali security personnel, this frivolity could only have got to the ears of President Barre, who, at our meeting, did a U-turn saying the South Africans were not offering enough in exchange for the overflights. Albert Vermaas’ plane and the others flew back with their tails between their legs.</p>
<p>In the Comores, he was more interested in seeing Derek Auret ride the 100-year-old tortoise at the presidential palace than seriously engaging with President Abdallah on relations with Muslim Africa. When I took him to the farm we were financing and managing where, mirabile dictu, our Agricultural Technical Services were growing mealies in a 2 metres rainfall zone to show him our money was not being wasted, he irritably aked: “Why do you bring me here? I’ve seen a farm before in my life.”</p>
<p>I was able to induce Abdouldaye Wade, who was to become Senegal’s President, to visit South Africa. I had great expectations of this visit because Abdouldaye, whom I had befriended in Paris, laid out a scheme for full relations between Senegal, and the powerhouse of Africa and for communal processes of African co-operation in defining internal South African policies with the government. This I set out in a memorandum to Pik. I interpreted from French in the hour-long meeting during which Abdouldaye laid out his intention, on becoming president, to break the mould and to take advantage of our expertise.</p>
<p>Pik listened impatiently. After an hour stood up saying: “You obviously know a lot about Africa”, and dismissed us. Perplexed, I went back into Pik’s office to determine what help would be given to make this man president. But there was Pik with his heels on his desk talking on the phone to Reeva Foreman about crossword clues.</p>
<p>The opportunities from 1986 for an advance into Africa were growing incrementally. Barriers lay in the Bloomsbury group favourites, Kenneth Kaunda (Zambia) and Julius Nyerere (Tanzania) but even here, the Department and Pik did nothing to seek rapprochement. It was National Intelligence (Mauritz Spaarwater) and Anglo-American that arranged for me to meet Kenneth Kaunda in Lusaka more than once.</p>
<p>Kaunda let me know that, as in 1978, when he met John Vorster, he was open to an approach from South Africa. Both he and Nyerere were reaching the end of their shelf-life. To expect a follow-up from Pik and the Washington mafia was a chimera even as the more intransigent anglophone countries were showing more flexibility.</p>
<p>Half of Africa speaks French and francophone countries presented the greatest chance of expansion into Africa, but, because of Pik’s and the Washington mafia’s inability to speak French, that half was ignored. We had an ally in the French Presidency, Jacques Foccart – France’s “Mr Africa”. His powerful influence in Africa had already been used in our relations with President Omar El-Hajj Bongo of Gabon.</p>
<p>He would have put his services at our disposal for any initiative we took which would have aided France’s relations in Africa: most of our military imports came from France. Even the later Mr Africa, François Mitterrand’s son, Jean-Christophe, expressed his willingness to collaborate with Francophone states and South Africa.</p>
<p>The Washington mafia continued the hollow policy in the US, whose Ronald Reagan was seen as a knight in shining armour and in Thatcher’s UK, demonstrating its defensiveness. We even made large donations to the election campaign of France’s Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>Africa conference at the Reserve Bank</p>
<p>In 1988, the Africa Division, under the astute aegis of the Branch’s secretary, André Pelser, arranged a two-day Africa conference attended by ESKOM, the railways, CSIR, banks and the Reserve Bank, the WWF and environmental bodies, trade and industry, mining houses, agricultural bodies, SADF and National Intelligence and any institution involved in Africa.</p>
<p>It attracted 250 delegates and from this, interlinking interests in the continent were exposed as never before – the wide-ranging penetration into the economy and administration of Africa opened eyes and disabused everyone of the impenetrability of Africa. The Director-General, van Heerden, sniffily appeared on the last day and, notwithstanding the evidence of this progress in expansion into Africa, it had no impact on the unwavering Western bias of our international relations.</p>
<p>One practical thing emerged from the conference – the launching of transnational parks promoted by Anthony Hall-Martin of National Parks. The report by André Pelser went unread by the élites.</p>
<p>Instead of taking our competence, industry, innovation, and African idealism into the continent, Pik’s policy put up weak and futile blockades against the African diseases of corruption, nepotism, incompetence and - the real killer – a lack of shame, leaking into South Africa’s reality and putting us in the pretty pass we’re in now.</p>
<p>We had needed to go boldly into Africa – and, as emerged clearly from André Pelser’s Africa Conference – many had already.</p>
<p>As quid pro quo for the ranch we had started in Equatorial Guinea, President Obiang Nguema had given me two signed concessions for oil exploration in two blocks to the South and South West. That was an exciting prospect and I took the documents, including seismic studies to Pik.</p>
<p>Here, I said, is an excellent opportunity to expose our mining, exploration and mineral expertise. Obiang set no restrictions on us and had not hidden our ranch from the world. By placing ourselves physically in the centre of Africa and displaying what we could offer could only help convince Africa of the folly of isolating our economy.</p>
<p>Pik was half-hearted. He directed me distractedly to take the concession offer to the oil industry. I approached Brian Gilbertson at Gencor, David Day at Mossgas, de Villiers at Sasol, Vorster at the Strategic Fuel Fund and the Director General of Mineral and Energy Affairs. All were surprised and interested but wanted to get their own data and samples as they doubted the seismic reports, and official and financial support had to underpin taking advantage of the concessions.</p>
<p>I took this to Pik with the strong recommendation of Cabinet approval, but, like so many opportunities offered out of Africa, it landed in his file 13. Recently, Exxon has revealed that these two blocks are the richest oilfields in the world.</p>
<p>So distant were we from Africa, that when I recommended that we approach the Red Cross and the French government to intervene with the Madagascar President, Didier Ratsiraka, to free two South Africans, pilot John Whyte and diamond dealer, David Marais, illegally interned in Antananarivo, Pik was blunt in writing back to me that Ratsiraka had stated he would free them only against the liberation of Nelson Mandela and I should no longer meddle in this matter to avoid government wrath.</p>
<p>Even a humanitarian effort could not be essayed in Africa. This was true fatalism (and cruelty): Whyte and Marais stayed behind bars for seven years.</p>
<p>The military dimension</p>
<p>If South Africa had taken its courage in its hands, it would have taken into the continent what had made South Africa respected. The critic will say that South Africa could never have been accepted but there’s enough evidence to show how the wheels had turned.</p>
<p>What struck Africa was the inventiveness and strength of the country. South Africa had competence and Africa looked on with bemusement as it itself fell into kleptocracy and corruption as Western aid allowed their élites to spend on their armies and ill-conceived programmes .</p>
<p>Our armed forces were alternatively feared and admired and any bold foreign policy would have necessitated defence force co-operation . Every African country wanted military co-operation, supply and tactical support. Pik would hardly work with the military and the military establishment had little respect (more like contempt) for him.</p>
<p>The SADF had experts on the ground – Col. Neels van Tonder spoke excellent French and Admiral Koos Louw was Portuguese-speaking so that, to this day, Angolans, Mozambicans, Guineans and Cape Verdeans seek him out. The SADF had better intelligence and often remarkable penetration into the inner circle of African governments.</p>
<p>Pik had so rudely castigated Renamo’s Afonso Dhlakama at a meeting at the Observatory in Pretoria arranged by the SADF that it almost jeopardised the talks in which I was involved in Rome for the Renamo and Frelimo Peace Protocol .</p>
<p>When I phoned Derek Auret from Rome about what offers we could make to satisfy Dhlakama he said feebly: “Maybe farm implements.” The SADF knew exactly what security guarantees he needed – they knew how Unita’s representatives in Luanda had been assassinated. Pik’s aversion to the military was paranoid. The Defence Minister, Magnus Malan, was no match for Pik’s bullying.</p>
<p>Neighbouring countries</p>
<p>Pik stated to the Institute of Commonwealth Studies: “It had been clear to the DFA that the burden of Namibia had to be removed – like Rhodesia before it – to enable us to tackle the problems in this country.”</p>
<p>“Burden”? “Had to be removed&hellip;”? What sort of language is that? Draw up the drawbridge? Put up the stockade and tidy up the fort? It was in no way clear to “the DFA” that South Africa needed to get “rid of” of neighbourly problems.</p>
<p>Courage was even more essential to face up to the dilemmas of neighbouring countries – the problems Pik said had to be “got rid of”. I have no record of Pik ever meeting Mugabe except for rubbing shoulders at the Angola peace protocol in Rome.</p>
<p>If a pro-active role had been launched instead of adopting the fatalistic “Godswater oor Godsakker”, Zimbabwe, the food basket of Africa, would not have suffered its cruel fate.</p>
<p>Pik boasted he convinced the Cabinet (from the UN Permanent Resident office) not to give any further aid to Ian Smith whom he hated and whom he often tried to get to resign. (Smith’s autobiography, Bitter Harvest, depicts Pik’s crude methods in lurid detail.) All very well, but Pik had no plan “B”.</p>
<p>Rhodesia had a lesser chance of withstanding nationalistic incursions and sanctions, but, without ensuring its stability and good governance post-Smith, a similar fate awaited us. Instead, the African diseases were fatalistically allowed to flourish. As Zimbabwe’s major trading partner, with thousands of South African farmers, industries and mining houses in the country, railways running through it, electricity supplied by Eskom, a firm policy and engagement were needed to prevent what happened and that implied the threat of force. As Stalin said about the Catholics: “How many divisions does the Pope have?”</p>
<p>Plan “B” would have prevented the Matabele massacres and helped alternative power bases to resist Mugabe’s one-man rule. Instead, Pik allowed Henry Kissinger to determine Rhodesia’s future, just as Pik and the Washington mafia allowed Chester Crocker to move negotiations with the Angolans and Cubans from Brazzaville to Cairo, Geneva and New York. In the interview with the Commonwealth Institute Pik said: “The Americans were very important in facilitating a final settlement. Chester Crocker knew Reagan quite well, and he himself saw achieving a peaceful settlement as a challenge.” How feeble can you get?</p>
<p>The same aversion to dealing with Africa directly pertained in Angola. At the briefing before the troop withdrawal talks, I opined to the delegation that agreement implied de jure recognition of the Angolan government and renunciation of Unita. Pik shouted me down: “We’ve already recognised the Angolan government in our talks in Lusaka &hellip;” As a result, Unita hovered like a gloomy omnipresence in the sky over the negotiations and the civil war continued for more than a decade afterwards. Manfully facing the alternative power bases would have made honest men of us.</p>
<p>Involving Africa in South Africa’s internal politics</p>
<p>Africa envied South Africa’s expertise. Not all African governments were convinced about the ANC, or its representivity.</p>
<p>As things went their inevitable way in the Western-driven policy, the government received several African delegations whose specific aim was to convince the Nationalists not to hand over South Africa’s nuclear weapons to the ANC.</p>
<p>Africa’s imvolvementt would have implied a fundamental change in internal politics in South Africa – and Verwoerd and Eric Louw had made peace with this possibility in discussions with Hammarskjold.</p>
<p>Discussion directly with the African detractors would have brought them into the loop to make them part of the solution which could have been of any nature imaginable: federal, confederal, Yugoslav separation, incorporating homelands into Botswana (Bophutatswana), Lesotho (QwaQwa), Swaziland (KwaNdebele), group rights, language policies – an African CODESA.</p>
<p>The overwhelming number of African countries has similar problems to us – and the one-man-one-vote principle had been a failure in almost all African states.</p>
<p>Pik was regarded as a liberal, but to the end he acquiesced in the homeland policy. At an Africa branch meeting, I asked the ambassadors to Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda and Ciskei to make an honest assessment of the opinion of the citizens of these countries about their independence. The ambassadors, who were all deployees of the National Party, reported this to Pik who hauled me over the coals for white-anting government policy.</p>
<p>The policy failure approached its predestined end. We had arranged for visits by PW Botha to Mozambique, Malawi, Ivory Coast and Zaïre. PW Botha wanted their governments to buy into the reforms that he imagined would satisfy Africa.</p>
<p>President Banda was his lively self and counted himself as one of those who had contributed to the changes for having danced with Tienie Vorster. President Chissano was cautious and hoped that the powerlines from Cahora Bassa could supply electricity to South Africa. President Houphouët-Boigny repeated that real Africa did not have prisons and it was time to let Mandela out.</p>
<p>The most telling was President Mobutu who listened impatiently to PW Botha and, behind his unsmiling face, you could see that he was thinking to himself: “You surrender monkey! After all these years of propping me up, you leave me in the lurch!”</p>
<p>The visits merely underlined that we had missed our opportunity of corralling Africa into solving Afropessimism, not only throughout the continent but now also in this country representing 80% of Southern Africa’s GDP.</p>
<p>Pik’s influence in cabinet</p>
<p>In Parliament, Pik was brusque and rude to parliamentarians. They did not like him. This contrasted with the general public’s favourable attitude towards him. He monopolised the foreign affairs debate in the Cabinet due to his knowledge of the workings of the UN and acquaintance with the politics of Western countries. None of his colleagues dared to oppose his cocksuredness about the its direction. He boasted of being the world’slongest-serving Foreign Minister and bore the title till 1994. His thespian ability kept him in position under both BJ Vorster and PW Botha.</p>
<p>So hot were his tears (actual tears) when FW de Klerk left him out of the Government of National Unity that FW relented and made him Mineral Affairs Minister in 1994.</p>
<p>FW de Klerk was not a fan of his and is quoted as saying at the leadership vote: “I was convinced that he did not have the characteristics – including emotional stability – to lead the country”.</p>
<p>Beware people who do not have friends. Pik had acolytes, disciples, followers and sycophants but only one real friend, his wife, Helena.</p>
<p>For others, he remained rasieleier – no wonder Lord Carrington refused point-blank to write the Preface to Theresa Papenfus’ biography, Pik Botha and his Times. Afrikaners should not only be angry with Pik but also with a blinkered government that could have made South Africa a leader in the continent and not another victim of the Africa diseases - and having no shame.

<h3 id="2019-rugby-world-cup-world-media-react-to-all-blacks-win-over-namibia">&ldquo;2019 Rugby World Cup: World media react to All Blacks&rsquo; win over Namibia&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/6Rm4pEK_VJnlif_U6Gs8-54vMBQ=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YF5N7X27QJB4BBTQS7HDSRD76Q.jpg" alt="img">
The All Blacks thrilled rugby fans and pundits once again in their 71-9 thrashing of Namibia. But it was far from a perfect performance from reigning world champions. Here&rsquo;s how the world media reacted to the Pool B matchup.</p>
<p>All Blacks obliterate gutsy Namibia in 11-try rout after a clumsy first-half performance - by Daniel Schofield of The Telegraph</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move aside Uruguay and Japan, all hail Namibia. Ignore the final score, this was the guttiest performance in the World Cup of underdogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For 185 glorious seconds Namibia led New Zealand. With five minutes remaining in the first half, the world champions were only leading by a point with scrum half Damian Stevens kicking three penalties for Namibia. The All Blacks, the all-conquering demi-gods, were rattled, frequently forced to scramble in defence and made to look all too mortal by a squad of farmers, accountants and just seven professional players.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All Blacks fall behind before brushing aside brave Namibia at Rugby World Cup - by Robert Kitson of The Guardian</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not every inflated Rugby World Cup scoreline tells the full story and this was a prime example. New Zealand finished up with 11 tries and a comfortable-looking victory but the final margin did scant justice to the efforts of a spirited Namibia side who, for 35 minutes, proved more than a match for their illustrious opponents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It even caused Steve Hansen to suggest afterwards his players &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t turn up with the right attitude&rdquo; in the first half before order was restored with a torrent of 47 unanswered second-half points. Until the game&rsquo;s final score, a spectacular try finished in the left corner by TJ Perenara following a reverse pass from his energetic fellow replacement Brad Weber, it was Namibia who provided much of the entertainment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadly for the romantics it could not last indefinitely. Despite a four-day turnaround, two props, Nepo Laulala and Ofa Tu&rsquo;ungafasi, being shown yellow cards for clumsy challenges and the returning Brodie Retallick lasting just 30 minutes, the All Blacks remain the most ruthless team in the world at picking off tiring opposition. A try apiece from the replacement Angus Ta&rsquo;avao and the full-back Ben Smith, added to earlier scores from Sevu Reece and Anton Lienert-Brown, put them 24-9 ahead at the interval and thereafter it was one-way traffic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All Blacks put on second-half clinic to sink brave Namibia - by Richard Parkin of The Guardian</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a testament to how much any individual man with a thumping heart can play above themselves. Helarius Kisting - the player who until recently was still an amateur, before moving to Romania to chase his passion, cutting down a flying Jordie Barrett - 20kg+ his superior - with a courageous tackle. And yet the All Blacks came, and came again, and like the big bad wolf of the fairytales, eventually blew Namibia&rsquo;s house down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a tough, rugged, brave first thirty from the African minnows. More than that, though, it was disciplined, and it was smart. Carrying with ball-in-hand, not playing into the All Blacks hands by allowing flowing counter attacks. They earned good field position, and they took their points on offer. At 10-9 for just a glimmer, perhaps they even dared to dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But 80 minutes is an age in professional rugby. Ask even tier one nations who hit 50 or 60 minutes against the All Blacks and still think they&rsquo;re in it (<em>coughs</em> Australia) &hellip; Today Namibia managed 35-40 minutes. Next time, maybe they&rsquo;ll dream of 50. That&rsquo;s the mission, that&rsquo;s the goal, and it&rsquo;s why aspiring nations pit themselves against the best in the world &hellip; For their part, the ABs were uncharacteristically sloppy at times in the first half. Kicks into touch on the full, balls put to ground, and men yellow-carded for high shots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All Blacks beat Namibia 71-9 in pool clash - Fox Sports Australia</p>
<p>&ldquo;An experimental New Zealand side recovered from a sticky start and two yellow cards to hammer Namibia 71-9 and move one step closer to finishing top of their pool at the Rugby World Cup on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Namibia battled to within a point at 10-9 after half an hour before the two-time defending champions accelerated away to eclipse their 58-14 victory over the Welwitschias at the 2015 World Cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The All Blacks were finding it hard going against the physical Namibians, who twice worked their way up field and won a pair of penalties which Stevens knocked over to take them to only 10-9 down after half-an-hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Blacks prop Nepo Laulala was sent to the sin bin for a high tackle on Stevens, and Brodie Retallick&rsquo;s comeback after a dislocated shoulder lasted just 30 minutes as there were uncomfortable moments for the world champions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stand-in flyhalf Barrett leads All Blacks&rsquo; rout of Namibia - Foster Niumata of AP</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the keys to the All Blacks machine, first-time flyhalf Jordie Barrett stalled it a couple of times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barrett stayed positive, though, refocused, respected the ball, and ultimately drove the world&rsquo;s No. 1-ranked rugby team smoothly and superbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much like Barrett, New Zealand sputtered for a while then started purring, and put Namibia&rsquo;s amateurs in their place in the Rugby World Cup by a 71-9 scoreline on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was competitive for a while. The Namibians were closer to full strength eight days after conceding 57 to South Africa, and gave New Zealand some bother in the first half. Their plan to play &ldquo;boring rugby&rdquo; by keeping the ball effectively frustrated the All Blacks, and their gang-tackling forced errors from the impatient defending champions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All Blacks win to go top of Rugby World Cup Pool B - Mike Henson of the BBC</p>
<p>&ldquo;World champions New Zealand stretched out to a comprehensive 62-point winning margin over lowly Namibia, but only after the underdogs had held them up with a brave first-half display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With 35 minutes gone, Namibia, ranked 23rd in the world, were within one point of the three-time winners &hellip; But the All Blacks were in clinical mood in the second half, finishing with 11 tries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pre-match expectations of a New Zealand rout were initially confounded as Namibia, the lowest-ranked side in the tournament, showed no sign of being awed by the prospect of taking on the world number one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well as a fast defensive line and a determination to get involved in the breakdown, Namibia showed some slick hands and incisive lines to make regular incursions into the All Blacks defence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>New Zealand overcome early struggles to beat Namibia easily - by Joel Fitzpatrick of Kyodo News</p>
<p>&ldquo;For about 30 minutes on Sunday, Namibia looked very much New Zealand&rsquo;s equal, the African nation that has yet to win at the Rugby World Cup giving as good as they got until the inevitable talent gap allowed the Kiwis to run away with a 71-9 win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Namibia led the game early at Tokyo Stadium (Ajinomoto Stadium) for approximately three minutes and were a try-saving tackle away from going in front again in the 13th minute &hellip; The Welwitschias cut the deficit to just four with a 25th minute penalty and then to one with another kick four minutes later, despite having already given up two tries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that point on, however, New Zealand&rsquo;s class emerged and the All Blacks finished out the first half with two more tries, one to and the other to Ben Smith, to take the lead to 15 despite losing Nepo Laulala to a yellow card for a high tackle.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="who-would-want-to-kill-a-lion-inside-the-minds-of-trophy-hunters">&ldquo;Who would want to kill a lion? Inside the minds of trophy hunters&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13c02e3f146d8d686ded047ff986a384580015e2/0_39_2305_1383/master/2305.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=d7dbe326563272b96efee7c3b84fafc3" alt="img">
From the dentist who felled Cecil the lion to the woman who shot a goat on Islay, keen hunters are happy to fork out small fortunes to kill wildlife. But why do they do it – and what is the true cost of their obsession?</p>
<p>The most elephants that Ron Thomson has ever killed by himself, in one go, is 32. It took him about 15 minutes. Growing up in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, Thomson began hunting as a teenager and quickly became expert. From 1959, he worked as a national parks ranger and was regularly called on to kill animals that came into conflict with man. “It was a great thrill to me, to be very honest,” he says by phone from Kenton-on-Sea, the small coastal town in South Africa where he lives. “Some people enjoy hunting just as much as other people abhor it. I happened to enjoy it.”</p>
<p>Now 79, Thomson has not shot an elephant for decades, and he struggles to find an open-minded audience for his stories of having, in his own words, “by far hunted more than any other man alive”. Today there are people who hunt, and many more people who feel a deep-seated aversion to it; for whom the image of an animal slain by man – regardless of species, motive, legal status or even historical context – is nothing but repellent.</p>
<p>Today, these fault lines are most often exposed when a picture of a hunter grinning above their kill goes viral, as it did last month for the US hunter and television presenter Larysa Switlyk. Photographs of her posing with a goat and a sheep she had shot weeks earlier, and entirely legally, on the Scottish island of Islay went well beyond hunting circles on social media to be met with widespread disgust. Mike Russell, the local member of the Scottish parliament, told BBC Scotland it was unacceptable “to see people in camouflage … rejoicing at the killing of a goat”.</p>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon publicly sympathised with the outcry and said the law would be reviewed. Switlyk posted on Instagram that she would be heading out of internet access on her “next hunting adventure”. “Hopefully, that will give enough time for all the ignorant people out there sending me death threats to get educated on hunting and conservation.”</p>

<p>And that was a goat. In the case of species that people travel to glimpse in the wild, or just watch on the Discovery Channel, the outrage can reverberate around the world. What would possess someone to want to kill these animals, let alone pay tens of thousands of pounds for the opportunity to do so?</p>
<p>“If you ask 100 hunters, you will get 100 different answers,” says Jens Ulrik Høgh by phone from woodlands in Sweden, where he has been escorting groups on hunts of wild boar. Høgh, who works for Limpopo Travel &amp; Diana Hunting Tours, a Danish hunting travel company, compares the attraction to that of mountaineering, scuba diving or golf: a physical hobby through which you can see the world. Hunters travel to experience different challenges. Zebras, for example, are tricky because they gather in herds out in the open and are watchful for predators. “There are always eyes looking in every direction – it typically takes a couple of days to get one.” With baboons, numerous but intelligent primates, “you need to be a good hunter, a good stalker and a good shot”.</p>
<p>The demand is reflected in the price tag. It costs relatively little – about £3,000 – legally to hunt a giraffe because doing so is widely considered easy by hunters and therefore not desirable. “A giraffe is basically a very docile pile of meat. I could go shoot a cow in a field,” says Høgh. (For the same reason, he tells me, he is rolling his eyes at Switlyk, the self-styled “hardcore huntress”, posing with her trophies on Islay: “Who wants to kill a sheep?”)</p>
<p>Although Høgh has made about 30 trips to Africa, he has never killed a lion, elephant or much “super-big game” for a straightforward reason: it is very expensive, typically upwards of £20,000. (And rightly so, he adds.) “I simply cannot afford to go lion hunting. But if I could, I would.”</p>

<p>It is a tiny proportion of hunters who can, he says; he guesses fewer than 1%, although he is upfront about the distinction between hunting a wild lion and a “canned” one, an animal raised for slaughter. That comes much cheaper – but to hear Høgh tell it, it is a price no hunter with integrity would want to pay. “That’s basically a farmed animal. You wouldn’t even call it a hunt,” he says.</p>
<p>One name keeps cropping up in conversations about so-called trophy hunting: Cecil, the lion killed by Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer in Zimbabwe in 2015. Although it was legal to shoot him, he had been lured out of a national park where he was well-beloved, and Palmer, hunting with a bow and arrow, did not kill Cecil outright, meaning the animal suffered. “It was an outrageous and shabby thing,” says David Quammen, a US science writer who has written extensively about humanity’s relationship with predators. But, he adds, there is a skill, even nobility, to hunting when “old-fashioned” rules of fair chase are observed. “Anyone who is not vegetarian is ill-advised to condescend to the people who do that.”</p>
<p>It is undeniable that industrial meat production causes more global suffering than hunting. But even charges of hypocrisy do not deter opponents of hunting, even those who eat meat themselves, for whom the thrill of the chase could never justify taking a life.</p>
<p>This reflects the complexity of our often emotional, sometimes contradictory relationship with animals, which Quammen explores in his 2003 book, Monster of God. Hunting is an ancient impulse. From bringing down mammoths in the ice ages to the gladiatorial battles of Roman times, whether for food or sport, humans have always pitted themselves against animals. Large predators, such as big cats and bears, loom large in our collective consciousness, rendered either as “man-eaters” or charismatic and cuddly, like Simba and Pooh. And hunters argue sentiment is impeding our ability to protect them as a species.</p>
<p>“The ‘Hollywoodification’ of animals is, more than anything, the biggest threat to their survival,” says Loodt Büchner. As director of Tootabi Hunting Safaris, outfitting mostly US clients on legal hunts of “50-plus species” on ranch land in five southern African countries, he is now mostly deskbound. But, growing up poor in South Africa, he came to hunting as a valuable source of protein, joining his father hunting for antelope when he was as young as five or six. Today, the philanthropic arm of his business provides schoolchildren in Eastern Cape province with 3,400 meals of trophy-hunted meat each month.</p>
<p>Büchner says most of the backlash to hunting comes from “very fragile people” who conflate wildlife conservation – which can sometimes necessitate killing – with preservation, “shooting with a Canon camera, not a rifle”.</p>
<p>He makes no distinction between people who hunt for food and those who pay his company $13,500 (£10,400) for a package of 10 “trophy animals” in 10 days. Regardless of circumstance, no animal killed is ever wasted, with the meat either sold or consumed. In fact, he says, Tootabi has seen a 54% increase in revenue that he credits to the killing of Cecil because, before then, people didn’t know legal hunting was possible. Conversely, Høgh suggests the increase might instead be the result of the subsequent crackdown on canned lion hunting.</p>
<p>Much of the interest is from recent university graduates, says Büchner, which he ascribes to their generation’s desire to document unique experiences on social media. “It’s amazing to see the number of young people in Manhattan who all of a sudden realise there’s a world out there, that it’s not just shares and stocks: ‘We could actually go hunt animals, it sounds amazing.’”</p>

<p>The desire to hunt – especially for “ornaments” such as heads or horns – is often explained by detractors as being driven by male ego. Craig Packer, an ecologist now resident in Minneapolis after 35 years spent pushing back against unsustainable lion hunting in Tanzania, says many hunters model themselves on the Marlboro Man, the stereotypical picture of masculinity – or, more precisely, what he calls “toxic masculinity”.</p>
<p>He recalls his encounters with Steven Chancellor, a Republican fundraiser, who has shot about 50 lions and displays them in his home in Indiana: “He dresses up in black – he’s into that cowboy thing.” Chancellor is also one of many big-game hunters to sit on a new federal board tasked with advising on US import laws.</p>
<p>Packer says hunters often share Republican politics, a rural background and religion, leading them to reject evidence showing that species are under threat, because (Packer affects a redneck drawl), “only God can be getting rid of the wildlife”.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, hunters reject suggestions that they are motivated by their fragile masculinity. Høgh says it is an ill-informed stereotype. Büchner says it is sexist. “As an accredited dangerous game hunter, killing any animal isn’t fun, nor [about] boosting my ego,” he says. But earlier, he had said hunters were driven by the adrenaline rush – surely that is fun?</p>
<p>For Høgh, the trouble is that non-hunters see the act of killing an “innocent” animal as fundamentally dramatic or evil, as well as the primary goal of hunting. “It’s not about those 0.5 seconds,” he says. “I’ve met extremely few who took pleasure in killing animals, and the ones I have met, I wish they would actually stop hunting. It’s just perverse – they’re sadists.”</p>
<p>But it is entirely understandable people would assume otherwise, he adds, when that is what gets documented. “Hunters have been very poor at communicating the complexity of the experience. Often what we show the world is a picture of a dead animal and us sitting behind it with a big grin on our face.”</p>
<p>Høgh asks his groups not to post photos of their kills online, or at least to be mindful of how they might strike a non-hunter. But there are individuals – he assumes an American accent – who demand that it is “their right”. “And it is their right. But it’s still damn stupid.”</p>
<p>To add to the complexity of the debate, some point out that many of the people who most oppose the hunting of animals will never know the realities, and sometimes the costs, of living alongside them. “Wildlife is a problem for many people,” says Prof Adam Hart, a scientist at the University of Gloucestershire and host of the 2015 BBC Radio 4 documentary Big Game Theory. Elephants, for instance, raid crops and damage trees. Big cats kill livestock, while impala compete with them for food.</p>
<p>There is an important distinction, Gonçalves says, between an individual who kills an animal sensitively and skilfully for meat that they will consume themselves – “and hunting for a plaque on the wall and a selfie”.</p>
<p>Many, including Hart and Büchner, believe that hunting even big game can be not only sustainable but beneficial to species’ survival. They call it the “if it pays, it stays” approach, meaning that, by putting a monetary figure on animals, they become valuable and worthy of preservation. They say that if hunting and ranging is more lucrative than farming livestock or ecotourism, landowners are incentivised to buy more land – thereby conserving habitat – and ensure species’ long-term survival.</p>
<p>Hart says figures from Namibia and South Africa seem to bear this out, but cautions against oversimplification. “Is it good where we’ve got a system whereby the only way we can conserve wildlife is to actively use it? We [Britons] would say no, but we have a very privileged viewpoint. The biggest problem is that people don’t understand the complexities of the situation – there are different species, different habitats, different countries, different economies, different societies.”</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jens Ulrik Høgh with an ostrich he has shot: ‘Killing any animal isn’t fun.’ Photograph: Jens Ulrik Høgh</p>
<p>Not even Packer is against lion hunting in principle. But in Tanzania he found that the industry was resistant to reform and charging far too little per hunted animal to fund the conservation of their land. “What’s really infuriating to me is that they’re posing like they are the great saviours of wildlife, but they’re putting in pennies where they should be putting in pounds.”</p>
<p>A fair price, Packer says, would be about $1m a lion. “Steve Chancellor may be able to afford it. But there aren’t many Steve Chancellors.”</p>
<p>In Botswana, home to the world’s largest elephant population, Hart says that numbers have grown so great that their habitat cannot support them and they are causing lasting damage. The government there is considering lifting a 2014 ban on hunting elephants for sport, pointing to figures that say there are 237,000 animals in an area able to support 50,000.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Bill Oddie, Peter Egan, a cross-party group of MPs and a lifesize inflatable elephant delivered a 250,000-strong petition against the proposal to lift the ban to the Botswana high commission in London, saying that allowing hunting could push the species towards extinction. The protest marked the launch of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, founded by Eduardo Gonçalves, the former CEO of the League Against Animal Sports. He says elephant numbers in Botswana have only increased as a result of the 2014 ban, while populations in neighbouring countries have declined. “The ban on trophy hunting has been good for conservation – there’s no two ways about it,” he says.</p>
<p>He is scathing of the justification that hunting benefits communities or conservation, pointing out that if that was their motivation, hunters could donate direct to the cause. “They try to come up with rational arguments to justify their bloodlust,” he says. Moreover, he adds, there is an “indivisible line” between trophy hunting and poaching, with laws against poachers having an impact on poor African people while wealthy westerners lawfully carry out the same practice, for a price.</p>
<p>Thomson says many species suffer when there is an excess of elephants: arboreal snakes and chameleons, black hornbills, martial eagles, bush babies (“beautiful little monkey-like things”). Elephants’ lives have been valued above theirs by “purely human sentiment”, he says, now audibly angry. “The people who think like that don’t know anything about wildlife management. These are people who have never left their armchairs, in London or New York or wherever they live. They make these demands, and they haven’t a clue what is going on. We are the ones looking after the elephants in Africa. They are the ones that are causing all the problems.”</p>
<p>In 1971, Thomson and two other hunters were called on to halve the elephant population in Gonarezhou national park in Zimbabwe, killing 2,500 animals using semiautomatic rifles. “The three of us were able to kill between 30 and 50 elephants stone dead with brain shots in less than 60 seconds. In some cases, we were almost touching the elephants when we pulled the triggers. We did the job that had to be done, without any emotion and without any blood loss, and we did it exceptionally well.”</p>
<p>His own regret is that they hadn’t started sooner. The elephants’ numbers had already grown so great as to have caused permanent devastation to the park’s baobab trees – some so old, Thomson says, that they would have stood during Tutankhamun’s reign of Egypt. “To have these ancient trees wiped out before me – it broke my heart.”

<h3 id="from-the-biggest-to-the-longest-five-amazing-caves-to-visit">&ldquo;From the Biggest to the Longest, Five Amazing Caves To Visit&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/xQP8661azE4xxZzBRTcmNRpIbh8=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/54/94/5494bef0-defe-4e9d-bf18-76f1dba9d0ba/e1cvoiqixrtxl405gnwyzotlb7f3zoe48n2ngjbg9ewnsqksckpiornvrzpdnbruhsluhrdjaxzhusjpcmf1hu.jpg" alt="img">
Last weekend, cave explorers, scientists and geologists gathered at Hidden Earth, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s annual caving conference, to answer an important question: What&rsquo;s the largest cave in the world? Until then, the largest known cave chamber was thought to be Borneo&rsquo;s Sarawak Chamber, which is so large that it can fit multiple full-size airplanes inside. But after extensive laser scanning, cave explorers had a different cave to nominate: the Miao Room cavern, a chamber beneath China&rsquo;s Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park, accessible only by an underground stream. Precise laser measurements proved that Miao Room is the largest known cave chamber in the world by volume, measuring 380.7 million cubic feet (the Sarawak Chamber still has a larger surface area than the Miao Room chamber, however).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for non-professional cave explorers, the Miao Room cavern, located with the Gebihe cave system, isn&rsquo;t open to public visitors. But if you want to experience the amazing world beneath the Earth&rsquo;s surface, consider a trip to one of these five amazing caves instead.</p>
<p>Son Doong Cave, Vietnam</p>
<p>In 1991, Ho Khanh, a man living in the jungles of Vietnam, discovered the entrance to a cave, but the descent into the opening was steep—dropping more than 200 feet—and Khanh was unable to enter. His discovery drew the attention of explorers, who made it their mission to enter the cave. In 2009, spelunkers from the British Cave Research Association (BCRA) lead the first expedition into the Son Doong Cave. What they found was one of the largest caves known to man: Son Doong measures over 5.5 miles in length, and some of its caverns are large enough to hold a 40-story skyscraper.</p>
<p>Son Doong is also home to a virgin jungle growing more than 600 feet beneath the Earth&rsquo;s surface, in a portion of the cave where the roof has collapsed, allowing natural sunlight to filter down. Plants both small and large can thrive in the cave jungle—trees there can grow nearly 100 feet tall. The jungle&rsquo;s larger plants provide home to animals not normally found below the Earth, like monkeys. A river also flows within the Son Doong Cave—in English, Son Doong Cave means &ldquo;Mountain River Cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2013, Oxalis Adventures became the first (and only) licensed company to run tours into the caves. For $3,000, tourists were granted a six-day trip deep into the cave&rsquo;s interior. In 2015, Oxalis plans to offer eight trips a month into the cave, lead by BCRA experts who were all part of the original expedition into the cave.</p>
<p>Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, U.S.A.</p>
<p>On the surface, Mammoth National Park in central Kentucky encompasses around 80 square miles, but underneath lies a twisting labyrinth of limestone caves, creating a network that earns the title of the longest cave system in the world. 365 miles of the cave have been explored to date, but no one knows how far the cave system actually extends, as new caverns and recesses are continuously being discovered.</p>
<p>The first human to enter Mammoth Cave descended into its winding passages over 4,000 years ago. Today, the cave is a massive tourist attraction, with more than 390,000 visitors passing through its limestone halls each year. One of the cave&rsquo;s most remarkable features is the abundance of stalactite formations, which number in the thousands and were created from years of water seeping through the cave&rsquo;s limestone ceiling.</p>
<p>Mulu Caves, Borneo</p>
<p>The Mulu Caves, located in Gunung Mulu National Park on the island of Borneo, are home to the world&rsquo;s largest cave chamber by surface area, as well as one of the largest cave passages on Earth. The Sarawak Chamber, which measures 1.66 million square feet, is nearly 2,000 feet long and over 260 feet high—so large that it could hold 40 Boeing 747 airplanes. Deer Chamber, one of the largest cave passages on Earth, is so big that it could fit five cathedrals the size of Saint Paul&rsquo;s in London inside its cavernous walls. Thousands of bats live within the Mulu Caves, and exit every day around sunset in search for food, offering tourists a magnificent display of their exodus.</p>
<p>Sistema Sac Actun, Mexico</p>
<p>Located just miles from the Mexican village of Tulum, the Sistema Sac Actun is the second-longest known underwater cave system in the world; over 130 miles of it have been explored so far. The underwater cave is usually accessed through the Gran Cenote, a hugely popular destination for snorkelers and scuba divers alike. The cenote, or sinkhole, is one of hundreds that dot the expansive cave system. It is open all day to visitors, who can swim in its waters for a small fee.</p>
<p>New Athos Cave, Georgia</p>
<p>The country of Georgia is home to the world&rsquo;s deepest cave, the Krubera cave, which plummets 7,208 feet into the Earth. Unfortunately, the bathophobia-inducing locale isn&rsquo;t open to visitors, so those looking for an alternative will need to travel to the New Athos Cave (also called the Novy Afon Cave), located inside Georgia&rsquo;s Iverian Mountain.</p>
<p>In 1975, the town of New Athos decided to construct a railway within the cave for the purpose of luring tourists. The idea worked, and today, the New Athos Cave is one of Georgia&rsquo;s most popular attractions. The largest chamber in the cave is over 850 feet long and 160 feet high, and the cave itself is thought to be one of the largest in the world, though much of it remains unexplored.
