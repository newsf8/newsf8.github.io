He made his film debut with ‚ÄòKai Po Che!‚Äô in 2012 and was part of several hit films like PK and Kedarnath.</p>
<p>His biggest blockbuster was, however, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, which was biopic of the former Indian captain by the same name.

The 34-year-old was also preparing for his next movie ‚ÄòDil Bechara‚Äô slated to release late in 2020.</p>

Another one of his dialogues from Chhichore that can be used as life quote is &ldquo;Success Ke Baad Ka Plan Sabke Paas Hai &hellip; Lekin Agar Galti Se Fail Ho Gaye &hellip; Toh Failure Se Kaise Deal Karna Hai &hellip; Iski Koi Baat Hi Nahi Karna Chahta.&rdquo;</p>
