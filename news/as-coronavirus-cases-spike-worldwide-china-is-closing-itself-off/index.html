Hong Kong (CNN) China is closing its border to most foreigners amid fears of imported novel coronavirus cases causing a second outbreak in the country where the infection was first detected.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to enter the country will have to apply for a new visa at their local Chinese embassy or consulate. The announcement did not say how long this would take.</p>
<p>The decision to effectively seal off the country to foreigners is the latest in a series of moves intended to safeguard against infection from international travel, after more than 500 imported cases of the coronavirus were confirmed</p>
<p>The number of new domestic infections has slowed to a trickle in recent weeks. While Wuhan, the city previously at the epicenter of the outbreak, remains on lockdown, much of the rest of the country is returning to normal.</p>
<p>There are fears imported cases could lead to a renewed outbreak.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese city, already had to backtrack on relaxing restrictions after a spike in new infections, many of which were imported by international travelers.</p>
<p>Staff wear protective masks and visors as they walk in the arrivals area at Beijing Capital International Airport on March 24.</p>
<p>No &lsquo;foreign friends&rsquo;</p>
<p>Across China, reports have appeared in recent days of businesses banning foreign nationals from entering their premises. Accounts have even emerged of housing estates and office complexes barring non-Chinese from the premises.</p>
<p>All of that is despite the fact 90% of imported cases are linked to Chinese citizens returning from overseas, particularly the hundreds of thousands of students forced home by university closures</p>
<p>While the backlash against foreigners in China has not reached anything near the level of violence and open racism experienced by many Asians living in parts of Europe and the US, it appears to be part of a broader rise in xenophobia, seen in a number of Asian countries battling the outbreak.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Rodewald, an American working in Beijing, said she was stopped by her security guard from entering her own home this week. She said the guard asked if she was Russian and refused to let her pass even after she showed her residential ID card, even though Chinese residents continued to enter freely. She said she had to wait for the manager to arrive before she could go in.</p>
<p>At a Beijing gym popular with expats, managers posted a sign saying &ldquo;foreign friends&rdquo; would no longer be allowed to enter, &ldquo;because of (the) overseas epidemic threshold.&rdquo; CNN also saw doormen at a bar in Sanlitun, a popular Beijing nightlife area, refusing entry to non-Chinese-looking patrons.</p>
<p>These restrictions are not government backed and enforcement of them appears to not be rigorous.</p>
<p>At the bar in Sanlitun, for example, security staff did not check IDs, so ethnically Chinese foreign residents could enter. Jim Boyce, a Beijing resident who posted on Twitter about restrictions on foreigners, said that one barber shop which put up a sign barring non-Chinese still allowed at least one expat to get his hair cut there.</p>
<p>Called nine hotels in Beijing last week. None were accepting foreigners. Several said no foreigners, no matter how long they&rsquo;ve been in China. https://t.co/K21asyYLKV — Nathan VanderKlippe (@nvanderklippe) March 23, 2020</p>
<p>Some 900,000 foreigners live in China, according to state media, with the largest non-Chinese population in Shanghai. While the government has gradually made it easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residency, as it attempts to attract more overseas talent and investment, the number of foreigners who gain this status is still exceptionally small.</p>
<p>In 2010, when the last census was carried out, there were just 1,448 naturalized citizens in China, a nation of over 1.3 billion people.

<p>Israel&rsquo;s political deadlock may be coming to an end. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s political rival, Benny Gantz, has been elected speaker of the Israeli Parliament and voiced his desire to form an emergency national government . The surprise move suggests Gantz is willing to serve in a government led by Netanyahu, who has faced numerous political and legal challenges in the last few months. It has also prompted outrage from some of Gantz&rsquo;s followers, who feel betrayed. Israel has had three general elections in the span of a year, but attempts to form a majority government have all fallen short. But with Gantz&rsquo;s decision, there&rsquo;s a possibility his political following could unite with Netanyahu&rsquo;s Likud party to get the job done.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has taken sweeping actions against Venezuela&rsquo;s top leaders that are sure to mark a low point in relations between the US and the ailing socialist state. The Justice Department announced narco-terrorism and other criminal charges against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and senior leaders of his government, and the State Department designated Maduro and top current and former officials of Venezuela&rsquo;s military, parliament and judiciary under its Narcotics Rewards Program, offering multimillion-dollar bounties. US prosecutors say Venezuela&rsquo;s leaders enabled the trafficking of cocaine to the United States. Venezuelan leaders say the Trump administration&rsquo;s actions are a political distraction from the US coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>Mild tensions have been simmering on the high seas between Russia and the United Kingdom. The British Royal Navy said it&rsquo;s seen an unusual amount of activity from Russian warships in the English Channel and North Sea. In response, nine Royal Navy ships were charged with shadowing seven Russian ships for more than a week as they passed by the British Isles. This kind of thing happens occasionally, and British forces are sometimes forced to respond to Russian aircraft or ships as they get near the UK&rsquo;s borders.</p>

<h3 id="rapid-deterioration-in-global-investment-flows-as-coronavirus-spreads-un-trade-body">‘Rapid deterioration’ in global investment flows as Coronavirus spreads: UN trade body</h3>
<p><img src="https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2019/03/05-03-2019-NICA-782277-Sweden-Peacekeepers-MINUSMA.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg" alt="img">
Initial projections were based on data limited to February and expectations that East Asia would bear the brunt of the immediate economic impact - but with the virus spreading worldwide and with many countries in lockdown mode, a far greater shock on supply and demand looks inevitable, it said.</p>
<p>Many unknowns</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the decline will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic across different regions and countries, and the scope of containment measures that Governments are forced to put into place”, it said.</p>
<p>New UNCTAD estimates on how the #coronavirus pandemic will impact global investment show a dramatic 30% to 40% drop in #FDI flows during 2020-2021.</p>
<p>This is much more than our projections of 5% to 15% earlier this month. https://t.co/xxbiQNpM6E#COVID19 pic.twitter.com/EsO1D3yqpB — UNCTAD (@UNCTAD) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>“Importantly, it will also depend on the nature and scale of policy packages that most Governments are now putting together to support their economies”, the report added, “which will determine the duration of the recession and the speed of the recovery.”</p>
<p>Earnings guidance by companies that make up UNCTAD’s Top 100 list of transnational corporations – a bellwether of foreign direct investment trends – confirms a “rapid deterioration of prospects”, it said.</p>
<p>Supply chains and sales hit</p>
<p>Fifty-seven per cent of those companies which previously warned that the pandemic would upset their supply chains have since declared that it will drag down sales as well.</p>
<p>On average, the world’s top 5,000 multinational enterprises – which account for a significant share of global foreign direct investment – have revised their 2020 earnings estimates by an average of 30 per cent, UNCTAD said, adding that “the trend is likely to continue”.</p>
<p>Hardest hit are the energy and basic materials industries, airlines and the automotive industry. However, the number of other sectors that expect to be feel the blow of a global slump in demand is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>“Downward revisions of earnings estimates are now more serious in developed countries, contrary to the situation in early March”, UNCTAD said, with average revisions particularly strong in the United States due to the weighting of energy sector multinational enterprises.</p>
<p>Overall, it said, profit guidance from multinationals in developed countries have been revised downwards by 35 per cent since the start of the pandemic, compared to 20 per cent in developing countries. What’s more, downward revisions in Europe now exceed those issued in Asia.
