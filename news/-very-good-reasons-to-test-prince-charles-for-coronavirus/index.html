<p>There were &ldquo;very good reasons&rdquo; to test Prince Charles for coronavirus, Scotland&rsquo;s chief medical officer has insisted.</p>
<p>The heir to the throne is currently in isolation in Aberdeenshire after testing positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Questions have been raised over why he was eligible for a test from NHS Grampian while many frontline medical workers have been unable to get them.</p>
<p>Catherine Calderwood said the prince had been tested for &ldquo;clinical reasons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Clarence House announced on Wednesday that the Prince of Wales - who is known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland - had tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the 71-year-old prince had &ldquo;mild symptoms&rdquo; but was in good health and spirits, and was working from home from his residence at Birkhall, on the Balmoral estate.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Catherine Calderwood said she had spoken to NHS Grampian staff who looked after the Prince</p>
<p>His wife Camilla, 72, was also tested for the virus, but the result was negative.</p>
<p>Clarence House said the couple &ldquo;met the criteria required for testing&rdquo;, but the NHS Scotland website states that &ldquo;generally&rdquo; people are only tested if they have &ldquo;a serious illness that requires admission to hospital&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SNP MSP Joan McAlpine wished Prince Charles a speedy recovery, but added: &ldquo;Given that his symptoms are said to be mild, like many I wonder how he was tested when many NHS and social care workers cannot get tested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Calderwood defended the decision during an interview with the BBC&rsquo;s Good Morning Scotland programme.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;I have spoken to the team in Grampian who were looking after the individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My understanding is there were very good reasons for that person and his wife to be tested, and obviously I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to disclose anything else that I know because of patient confidentiality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @JoanMcAlpine I wish @Charles_HRH a speedy recovery. But given that his symptoms are said to be mild, like many I wonder how he was tested when many NHS and social care workers cannot get tested. My nephew, who has serious asthma and a chest infection was recently refused a test. .#coronavirus https://t.co/v79wbZq0ny — Joan McAlpine (@JoanMcAlpine) March 25, 2020 Report</p>
<p>BBC Scotland has spoken to a woman living in the same household as a frontline clinician at NHS Grampian. Both are isolating because she has been displaying symptoms - meaning the clinician is unable to go to work.</p>
<p>But they do not know whether they actually have coronavirus because they have not been able to have a test.</p>
<p>The woman said she knew of &ldquo;several other members of staff&rdquo; who were also in isolation for 14 days but had not be able to access any testing from NHS Grampian.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have a situation where staff are at home for 14 days in isolation and they may be negative. We need to get people tested so that if they are negative, they all need to get back to the front line where they are required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s shocking that NHS Grampian have been able to go out to Balmoral and test not only Prince Charles but Camilla, who is asymptomatic, when we have frontline medical, nursing and other key worker staff at home who are unable to access testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An NHS spokesperson said testing for key staff was &ldquo;being rolled out now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They said: &ldquo;Symptomatic household members who live with a critical member of staff will be offered testing for Covid-19 and influenza to inform a decision about lifting household isolation and allowing the critical staff member to return to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We appreciate this process has taken longer to put into practice than we would have liked, but it needed to be absolutely fit for widespread demand and risk prioritised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questions have also been raised about why the Prince was allowed to travel to Scotland after he had started to show mild symptoms.</p>
<p>People have been urged not to use second homes or holiday lets in remote parts of Scotland for self-isolation, as this can add extra pressure to local health services.</p>
<p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not want to comment on the specific case of the Prince, but added: &ldquo;We want people to behave responsibly, we don&rsquo;t want people to see the Highlands and islands of our country as places where they can outrun the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously there are places where people have homes in Scotland and people will choose to go to their homes, but we should all be responsible.&rdquo;

LONDON—Calling it the “nation’s foremost duty” to protect their 71-year-old heir apparent, the British royal family ordered 67 million citizens Wednesday to evacuate the United Kingdom until Prince Charles recovered from the novel coronavirus. “Starting immediately, all residents are hereby instructed to gather their necessary belongings, cross the border into nearby Europe, and allow Charles at least 14 days to self isolate in his country,” said royal spokeswoman Evelyn Robinson, adding that citizens should quickly board planes, trains, and boats to create a safe distance of 2,000 miles between the Prince of Wales and the nearest commoner. “In the wake of this country’s devastating Covid-19 outbreak, we want to remind all English, Scottish, and Irish nationals that choosing to remain quarantined places Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, for that matter, at an extremely high risk. To the Kingdom of Great Britain, we ask: What would you rather do? Simply take a few days to wade out into the English Channel? Or remain in the country, knowing that if a member of the royal family dies, there will be blood on your hands?” At press time, Robinson ordered all U.K. citizens to be as silent as possible when leaving the country, so as not to awaken Prince Charles from his afternoon nap.</p>

<p>Camilla, 72, tested negative for the virus, with the couple now self-isolating at their home in Balmoral, Scotland.</p>
<p>It is believed he suffered mild symptoms over the weekend while at Highgrove House in Gloucester and flew privately to Scotland on Sunday night where he was tested on Monday.</p>
<p>It is understood he is in good spirits and remains up and about.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace has since confirmed the Queen remains in &ldquo;good health&rdquo; after heading to Windsor last Thursday with Prince Philip a week earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Charles most recently saw the Queen &ldquo;briefly&rdquo; on March 12.</p>
<p>Medical experts believe the earliest Charles would have been contagious was March 13.</p>
<p>Charles has also spoken to both of his sons, Prince William, 37, in Norfolk and Prince Harry, 35, in Canada after the news.</p>
<p>Confirming the news today, Clarence House said: &ldquo;The Prince of Wales has tested positive for Coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another six members of staff now isolating with them.</p>
<p>Clarence House added: &ldquo;In accordance with Government and medical advice, the Prince and the Duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire where they met the criteria required for testing.</p>
<p>“It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HIGH ALERT</p>
<p>The royal met with Prince Albert of Monaco, who later tested positive for coronavirus, on March 10.</p>
<p>Charles saw the Queen &ldquo;briefly&rdquo; two days later on March 12, before his last public appearance at an event for the bushfires affected Australia.</p>
<p>A source said: &ldquo;He has displayed mild symptoms he is in good spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is working and continuing to work for the last few days as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medical advice is that it is unlikely that his condition will not escalate into a more serious case here on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince had been avoiding shaking hands with members of the public at a number of events recently, instead choosing to use the namaste gesture.</p>
<p>He last appeared in public with the Queen, along with princes William and Harry and other senior royals, at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 9.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: &ldquo;Her Majesty the Queen remains in good health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen last saw the Prince of Wales briefly after the investiture on the morning of the 12th March and is following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They will not comment on whether the Queen has been tested for coronavirus.</p>

<p>It comes as the UK death toll hit 422 yesterday in the biggest daily leap of fatalities.</p>
<p>There are now fears that half of the UK population may have already contracted the virus.</p>
<p>University of Oxford research suggested the disease could have become prevalent in the country two months before the first case was diagnosed.</p>
<p>Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford, led the study and says the UK must now increase testing to discover the true stage of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need immediately to begin large-scale serological surveys - antibody testing - to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in now,&rdquo; he told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The global death toll from the deadly bug has already hit more than 18,000 across the globe.</p>
