MINNEAPOLIS (AP) &ndash; The Minnesota Legislature is poised to pass a package to aid in the state&rsquo;s fight against COVID-19 on a day when the state recorded its second death from the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>State health officials said Thursday that the latest resident to die of the disease was from Ramsey County and was in their 80s.</p>
<p>Leading lawmakers negotiated the bill via private conference calls to minimize the risk of catching the disease.</p>
<p>Minnesota state, local and tribal governments are expected to get nearly $2.2 billion under the $2.2 trillion aid bill the U.S. Senate passed late Wednesday.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2020/03/724/407/covid-test-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="img">
A second person in Minnesota has died from the coronavirus in Minnesota as the number of people hospitalized with the illness continues to spike.</p>
<p>The latest death was a Ramsey County resident in their 80s, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. The state’s first death, also a Ramsey County resident in their 80s, was reported on March 21.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Minnesota jumped to 346 Thursday, up from 287 the day before, although state health officials say that number is still an undercount due to a lack of testing. The number of hospitalizations is now up to 41, compared to 26 on Wednesday. Thirty-one people are currently hospitalized with the virus.</p>
<p>Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday the ages of Minnesota&rsquo;s coronavirus patients range from five months to 104 years.</p>
<p>There are now 36 counties with confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Hennepin County has the most number of cases with 128, followed by Ramsey with 32 and Olmsted with 29.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that counties that do not have confirmed cases of COVID-19 are safe. Many of Minnesota&rsquo;s cases are the result of community transmission. Community transmission cases occur when the individual who tested positive did not travel or have any known contact with someone with COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should assume it [the coronavirus] is in all of our communities,&rdquo; Malcolm said.</p>

<p>Gov. Tim Walz said that based on his work with health department, he predicts that 40 to 80 percent of Minnesotans will get the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. MDH confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in Minnesota on March 6.</p>
<p>As the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state climbs, state officials have begun enacting drastic measures to reduce the number of places the coronavirus can be spread.</p>
<p>Gov. Walz issued a statewide stay-at-home order for two weeks, effective Friday, March 27 until April 10. He also extended the closure of bars, restaurants, salons, fitness centers and other businesses until May 1 and schools until May 4. Students will participate in distance learning during that time.</p>
<p>RELATED: Minnesota stay-at-home order: What you&rsquo;re allowed to do, what&rsquo;s staying open</p>
<p>The governor said ordering Minnesotans to stay home pushes the peak of the pandemic in the state out 14 weeks, until around June 28, with hospitals reaching peak capacity around June 7. This will buy the state&rsquo;s health care system more time to expand bed capacity and acquire more ventilators, he said.</p>
<p>Since March 6, Gov. Walz has declared a peacetime state of emergency, canceled or postponed all gatherings of 250 or more people, closed all schools, closed public gathering spaces such as theaters, gyms and bars and limited restaurants to carry-out and delivery orders. Walz is expanding unemployment benefits to employees impacted by the pandemic.</p>

<p>The governor also ordered hospitals to stop all elective surgeries and procedures, anything that can be delayed without risking a patient’s health. The order took effect on Monday, March 23 and could last weeks.</p>
<p>COVID-19 HOTLINES</p>
<p>MDH has two hotlines for questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The hotline for community mitigation (schools, childcare, business) questions is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The number to call is 651-297-1304 or 1-800-657-3504.</p>
<p>The hotline for health questions is also open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The number to call is 651-201-3920 or 1-800-657-3903.</p>
<p>WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE SICK</p>
<p>MDH says if you have symptoms of a respiratory disease (such as fever, coughing, muscle aches, sore threat and headache) you should stay home for at least seven days and at least three days with without a fever (without fever-reducing medicine).</p>
<p>If you have symptoms and can manage those symptoms at home, MDH said you do not have to seek health care or be tested for COVID-19. Just stay home if you are sick. If your symptoms worsen, if possible, call ahead before going into your health care provider.</p>
<p>RELATED: Minnesota Dept. of Health narrowing testing criteria amid national shortage of COVID-19 tests</p>
<p>&ldquo;People do not need to be tested for COVID-19 if they&rsquo;re in a situation where they&rsquo;d be able to manage their symptoms at home; since there is no treatment for mild cases, there is no clinical decision that would be made based on the test result,&rdquo; MDH Director of Infectious Disease Kris Ehresmann said.</p>
<p>MDH has restricted the criteria to test for COVID-19 due to a limited supply of testing materials. They are giving priority to hospitalized patients as well as ill health care workers and ill persons living in congregate living settings such as long-term care. The new restrictions on testing will remain in place indefinitely until more tests are provided to Minnesota.</p>
<p>ABOUT COVID-19</p>
<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is spread primarily by respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza is spread. It can also spread when people touch surfaces that have been contaminated by an infected person and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, patients with confirmed COVID-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some patients have had other symptoms including muscle aches, headache, sore throat or diarrhea.</p>
<p>Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.</p>
<p>The CDC and MDH recommend Minnesotans do the following to protect themselves and others and limit the spread of COVID-19:

<h3 id="coronavirus-in-minnesota-positive-covid-19-cases-in-state-increase-to-346-2nd-death-reported">Coronavirus In Minnesota: Positive COVID-19 Cases In State Increase To 346; 2nd Death Reported</h3>
<p><img src="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909630/2020/03/coronavirus-COVID-19-1.jpg?w=1500" alt="img"></p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — State health officials announced Thursday that the number of positive coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Minnesota has risen to 346, up from 287 on Wednesday. A second person has also died.</p>
<p>According to a map from the Minnesota Department of Health, most of the positive cases so far are in the Twin Cities metro. Hennepin County alone has 128 positive cases.</p>
<p>Still, the virus appears to be spreading across greater Minnesota, from St. Louis and Clay counties up north to Fillmore and Blue Earth counties in southern Minnesota.</p>
<p>Approximately 12,950 people have completed tests in the state’s Public Health Lab and external laboratories, health officials say. Of them, more than 30 are currently being hospitalized.</p>
<p>In a daily update with health officials Thursday afternoon, Gov. Tim Walz says the age range of those infected with COVID-19 is 5 months old to 104 years old.</p>
<p>“So, the COVID-19 virus as we know spans the spectrum,” Walz said.</p>
<p>So far, two people have died from the disease. Both deaths involve a Ramsey County resident in their 80s.</p>
<p>MDH released a statement acknowledging the death:</p>
<p>We are saddened to report that a second Minnesotan has died from a confirmed case of COVID-19. As with the first death announced March 21, this second death involved a resident of Ramsey County in their 80s. We will provide any additional information that is available on this death during the afternoon media briefing call. We share our condolences with the family and friends of the deceased person, and we will continue to work hard to prevent additional illnesses and deaths in Minnesota. All Minnesotans can help us in this work by following the state’s guidance to stay at home, practice social distancing and be diligent about washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than 134 people have recovered and no longer are required to be in isolation.</p>
<p>Walz issued an executive “stay at home” order that will be implemented Friday at 11:59 p.m. People are being asked to limit movement outside to essential services.</p>
<p>Walz stressed that the order “does not mean we are going to ask you to show your papers”, and that the goal is social distancing. He said he is not declaring martial law.</p>
<p>In the daily update, Walz also said Asian Americans and Pacific Island Minnesotans are reporting racist comments and discrimination because some call it “Chinese Virus.”</p>
<p>“We cannot tolerate discrimination against our neighbors,” he said.</p>
<p>In response to President Donald Trump’s comments about trying to get America back to work by Easter (April 12), Walz said the state will “base everything we do on the facts of science.”</p>
<p>Walz’s final comment was to compliment Minnesota’s response and abiding by social distancing.</p>
<p>“The cooperation of Minnesotans has been absolutely spectacular. I’m not surprised by it, but I think it always lifts your heart,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Minnesota Legislature is meeting Thursday to pass a second emergency COVID-19 rescue bill.</p>
<p>Follow detailed updates on Pat Kessler’s Twitter page.</p>
<p>For most people, COVID-19 symptoms are mild. However, the disease can be deadly for the elderly and those with sensitive lungs. Even so, the vast majority of people who contract the virus recover.</p>
<p>Health officials say those with questions about COVID-19 can call the Minnesota Department of Health hotline at 651-201-3920.
