With the shadow of coronavirus looming large, here are a few ways to have a safe Holi. By Team Viva

Usually, at this time bright colours fill the air and people miss no opportunity to be playful. But this time around, the must-haves to celebrate Holi are not gulaal and pichkaari, and rather masks and sanitisers. Be it metros, local markets or malls, there are indications that the awareness about coronavirus is spiking as more and more people are staying at home and avoiding huge gatherings. The government has taken several steps to ensure that the spread of the disease can be arrested. This will naturally play the spoiler for the big Holi bash that is the norm.

Here are a few ways to celebrate the festival under the threat of coronavirus.

More of a family affair

Asymptomatic people can also spread the infection, which is why social distancing and personal hygiene is important. So, if you have a large Holi gathering and go from house to house, the risk of getting the infection increases. This is the reason many societies and offices are cancelling Holi celebrations and keeping it to their closed groups. Rakesh Sheth, founder of

& Stirred, said, “The best way to play safe Holi is to avoid concerts and public gatherings and stick to small catch-up with closed ones.”

Not only Delhiites, it’s the same even for Bollywood celebrities. For actor Urvashi Rautela, the celebrations this time will be an intimate affair with family and friends. “I am celebrating with my friends and family this year at home because of the coronavirus scare. It is going to be an intimate affair with lots of food and fun,” said Urvashi.

Even the shoot of actor C Joseph Vijay’s forthcoming release, Master, has been wrapped. It was announced yesterday that a grand audio launch would take place on March 15. However, unlike the time when a huge stadium would be booked to accommodate fans for such an event, the makers have decided to avoid making it a big-crowd event owing to the fear of coronavirus.

Garden and terrace parties with dry and herbal colours

This time, Holi on terrace with a close circle is a great idea for many as they are avoiding social gatherings and society parties. Recently, a coronavirus case was suspected in Raj Nagar Extension of Ghaziabad. Not surprisingly, it had a ripple effect. Deepa Garg, resident, Anandam Villas, which is in the same area, said that the society called off the Holi party this time and people are organising garden and terrace parties. “There are a bunch of parties on terrace that have already started. One can match steps with loud Bollywood numbers and throw dry, herbal colours at each other,” she added.

More focus on music and food

Food and music form the essence of this festival with its own signature delights and Bollywood hits like Balam Pichkari, Badri Ki Dulhania, Rang Barse, Let’s Play Holi and more. Though traditional dishes are made and consumed every time but this time it can take the centre stage of the celebration. A student from Dehradun who is in town to celebrate the festival, Harsh Shahi, said, “Along with parties, I wait for Holi to get treated with Gujiyas, Dahi vada, Aloo chaat, Malpua, Thandai and more. But this time the virus has left me only with this option. No public parties or pichkari (water guns) waali Holi.”

Flower petals replacing colours

In the recent years, there have been awareness drives on water conservation and impact of harmful colours on our skin. As a result, people have mostly been using herbal and dry colours. But this time in the wake of the virus, the emphasis is more on flower petals. Recently, a case of coronavirus was suspected in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad. A resident of Vardaan Apartments in the area, Abhay Sharma, said that most of the people in his society will play with flower petals this time and avoid the use of colours. He said, “We play with eco-friendly colours every year but this time due to the virus outbreak, we are planning to avoid colours and only play with rose, lotus, and marigold petals.”

Is alcohol high on agenda?

Holi is synonymous with rang aur bhang. Bhang lassi is the most popular form of bhang consumed in the country, especially on this festival. Served in the form of thandai, pakoda and gujiya, it is an integral part of the colourful celebrations. But this time, people seem to ditch this tradition and load their homes with fancy bottles as they want to relax and enjoy it indoors.

Keep sanitiser at doorstep

If you decide to play Holi this time, ensure that everyone you play with is not displaying any symptoms for the virus. Also, make sure that you follow some precautionary measures and ask your guests too to do the same. Keep a sanitiser at the doorstep so that guests can use it before entering the home. “If you are currently showing any sign of respiratory tract infection (cough, frequent sneezing, runny nose etc) even mild, it’s better to avoid playing and attending any parties. Don’t forget the mask. It will help you recover faster and also protect others from getting exposed,” said Dr Chhavi Kiran Gupta, assistant professor at department of preventive and social medicine, Subharti Medical College.
