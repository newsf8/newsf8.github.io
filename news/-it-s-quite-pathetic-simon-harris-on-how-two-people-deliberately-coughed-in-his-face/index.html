<p>Simon Harris has announced that student nurses and midwives will get fulltime wages during the Coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The Minister for Health said that he is opening the wallet to pay the frontline workers to show the whole country’s appreciation for their unbelievable dedication and commitment at this special time.</p>
<p>The nurses qualify for the pay if they sign-up to the HSE’s official call for staff.</p>
<p>Mr Harris said: “This is an offer and not an obligation.</p>
<p>“But I know so many of our student nurses want to play their role as we navigate our way through these difficult times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our healthcare professionals have shown immense leadership and I will do everything I can to support them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The move has been widely welcomed.</p>
<p>Labour health spokesman, Alan Kelly, said: “I welcome the decision by the Government to pay student nurses as healthcare assistants during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>“Student nurses like many healthcare professionals are putting themselves out on the frontline working to protect us from the spread of COVID-19, but unlike many of their colleagues in our hospitals up until now they were not being paid.</p>
<p>“The decision to pay student nurses at this time is absolutely the right decision.</p>
<p>“Student nurses have already paid over €3,000 in fees for the academic year, which has been cut short, many have had to give up part-time jobs in other health-care settings to scrub up and join the fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Paying them as healthcare assistants will go some way to help them with their living expenses.&rdquo;

<h3 id="simon-harris-thanks-irish-people-for-huge-sacrifice-ahead-of-new-restrictions">Simon Harris thanks Irish people for huge sacrifice ahead of new restrictions</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/9ecef/39071620.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/bpanews_5a57e369-9a41-424c-8edc-bc7224ce5a3e_1" alt="img">
Health Minister Simon Harris has thanked Irish people for their sacrifices ahead of new restrictions expected to be announced on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) met on Tuesday morning to consider issuing further advice on restricting public gatherings.</p>
<p>It is expected non-essential businesses such as cafes, restaurants and other sectors regarded as non-essential may be asked to close with further restrictions on public outside gatherings.</p>
<p>It comes after large numbers of people gathered at beaches and parks over the weekend and county councils closed areas as people were not complying with social distancing.</p>
<p>I just want to say thank you to everyone working so hard in our health service &amp; public service to keep us safe &amp; well. Thanks to everyone trying so hard. We are a great country with brilliant people &amp; together we will prevail. Public Health Team will meet tomorrow #coronavirus — Simon Harris TD (@SimonHarrisTD) March 23, 2020</p>
<p>Mr Harris said: “The public health emergency team has just concluded and they made a series of recommendations and I will be bringing them to the cabinet meeting this morning and Government will make announcements accordingly later.</p>
<p>“There is a massive national effort under way in our country to keep our people safe and to keep our people well.</p>
<p>“Irish people are making huge sacrifices in communities right across the country and I want to thank them for that.</p>
<p>“What Government wants to do is support them in their efforts and to make sure we can keep our people safe and well.”</p>
<p>Education Minister Joe McHugh said schools are due to remain closed until at least March 29, but will not be opening immediately after that.</p>
<p>Some really helpful advice for students and their families. It is a time of great stress for all of us so please take a look at what you can do to reduce that&hellip; https://t.co/uZIi6yMsze — Joe McHugh (@McHughJoeTD) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>He said there should be further confirmation on Tuesday or Wednesday of the extension of the school closures.</p>
<p>Speaking on Galway Bay FM on Tuesday morning, he added: “My commitment to the students and for the students who are maybe having their breakfast this morning and maybe getting ready to study and really, really putting in such an effort – my commitment to them, and the department’s commitment is: we want to make those exams happen.</p>
<p>“Obviously we are going to be influenced and directed by the health experts. We don’t know where we are going to be in terms of the peak of this virus.</p>
<p>“I think we owe it to those young people who are studying and putting in the effort to see this through to try to have these exams this year. When I say this year, I mean the dates that are defined for this year. That’s what we are working towards.”</p>
<p>The chief executive of the HSE warned that the health system will come under stress “like we have never seen before” as the Covid-19 crisis deepens.</p>
<p>What we have to do now, to protect everyone, is connect socially, disconnect physically. Itâs vital that we keep #COVID19 at a distance. Thanks to our generous colleagues in @failte_ireland for creating this campaign on behalf of @HSELive and @roinnslainte #ItsInOurHands pic.twitter.com/P5XvPO4O6b — HSE Ireland (@HSELive) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>Ireland has recorded two more deaths among people who tested positive for Covid-19. They were males in the east of the country.</p>
<p>There have been six fatalities related to the infection in the Republic, the Department of Health said. The total number of confirmed cases is 1,125.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, HSE boss Paul Reid tweeted: “Soon, our health system will be under stress like we have never seen before.</p>
<p>“We’ve been preparing 24 x 7. This involves using hotels, temporary &amp; private hospitals &amp; other locations.</p>
<p>“The less sick wont need a hospital. We do care, so please stick with us.”</p>
<p>Soon, our health system will be under stress like we have never seen before. We&rsquo;ve been preparing 24 x 7. This involves using hotels, temporary &amp; private hospitals &amp; other locations.

<p>The cabinet will meet on Tuesday to consider updated recommendations on tackling Covid-19 from the National Public Health Emergency Team.</p>
<p>On Monday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that while some members of the public had not been complying with social distancing measures, he would not bow to political pressure to tighten restrictions and would only act on expert advice.</p>
<p>He has been facing calls from the leaders of opposition parties to tighten restrictions.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald called for all non-essential businesses to close, while Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said more “severe restrictions” needed to be imposed for social distancing.</p>
<p>The current measures, which include the closure of schools and colleges, creches and pubs, are due to expire on March 29 but may be extended.</p>
