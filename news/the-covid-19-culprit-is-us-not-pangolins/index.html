Dr. Robert Breiman is an MD and a professor of Global Health and Infectious Diseases at Emory University. He was previously based in Bangladesh and Kenya with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and led investigations and response to a number of major outbreaks. Dr. Breiman is a member of the National Academy of Medicine. The opinions expressed in the commentary are those of the author. View more opinions on CNN.</p>
<p>(CNN) Early in the SARS outbreak, some 17 years ago, I was in Beijing and Guangzhou with an international team of scientists assembled by the World Health Organization. In live animal markets, the civet cat was a commodity.</p>
<p>The mammal, which resembles a mongoose more than a cat, is a culinary delicacy in China and was believed to have health benefits. Civets are shy animals and avoid humans and other animals. Urbanization and deforestation had threatened civets and put them in closer contact with the horseshoe bat, which was shown to carry the SARS virus.</p>
<p>After a long investigation, civets were determined to have caused the SARS outbreak . As the intermediate host, civets spilled the virus over to one or more humans while the horseshoe bat was believed to have harbored the virus strains, serving as the virus reservoir.</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate that there may be parallels between SARS and the current pandemic. Scientists have found coronaviruses, genetically similar to the Covid19 virus, in pangolins , leading to a hypothesis that they served as an intermediate host, much like civet cats did with SARS.</p>
<p>But if pangolins or civet cats could talk, they would claim no responsibility for the outbreaks they have been associated with. And I would agree. The culprits in both coronavirus outbreaks that began in China are not the pangolin, horseshoe bat or civet cat. We have met the enemy: It is us.</p>
<p>Pangolins are critically endangered anteaters that resemble armadillos. While they are a protected species, they are often smuggled from African and Asian countries into China where they are sold for their meat and scales. In local folklore and traditional medicine, the pangolin&rsquo;s scales are thought to provide a variety of benefits. Since it is illegally poached, purchase of a pangolin in animal markets and under-the-table settings is rumored to be up to $600 per kilogram.</p>
<p>We have affected these creatures in more ways than poaching them. As human populations grow, our incursion into a variety of habitats expands even as our appetite for certain animals remains unabated. As it has with civets, deforestation has dramatically affected the areas available for pangolins&rsquo; foraging, putting them in closer contact with other animals including bats, which are reservoirs for other dangerous viruses like Nipah virus, and possibly Ebola. This may have facilitated the spread of disease.</p>
<p>Our behaviors — interactions with these animals and their environments — are responsible for the dangers that increasingly threaten not just animal species, but also perhaps our own. If we do nothing, outbreaks like Covid-19 will continue to occur, and likely accelerate in number.</p>
<p>Given our unprecedented mobility, a single &ldquo;spillover&rdquo; event, a virus jumping from animal to human, in a remote location can rapidly result in a global calamity like what we are experiencing now. Clearing land for human activities leads to contact with (and between) animals and their secretions at an unparalleled intensity. Some animals may be tolerant of organisms to which we have not previously been exposed, and to which we do not have protective immune responses.</p>
<p>Occasionally, as in the case of Covid-19, genetic characteristics make it harmful for humans. Hunting and marketing of exotic, environmentally threatened animals have often been the final blow, providing a path for pathogens to be transmitted to susceptible humans. If, as in the case of SARS and Covid-19, the virus can then be passed from human to human, it may only take a single spillover event to lead to a global pandemic given the degree of human mobility in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Our behaviors play an immense role with what dangers we face — and will face in the future.</p>
<p>So, we have a couple of choices. We can accept that outbreaks like Covid-19 will continue to occur, and likely accelerate in number, as human populations grow, as our incursions into a variety of habitats expand and as our penchant for certain animals continues.</p>
<p>Or, we can decide that the threat to humans (and potentially other animal species) is too great and we must be intentional about changing the path we are on. For instance, environmental experts and public servants should deliberate and decide the best way governments could tightly control the harvesting of trees and expand use of land while considering the impacts on animal habitats. They can do this with a particular eye towards reducing the risk of animal-to-human pathogen-spillover events (among other considerations) when granting permits.</p>

<p>Smuggled pangolins have been found to carry viruses closely related to the one sweeping the world.</p>
<p>Scientists say the sale of the animals in wildlife markets should be strictly prohibited to minimise the risk of future outbreaks.</p>
<p>Pangolins are the most-commonly illegally trafficked mammal, used both as food and in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>In research published in the journal Nature, researchers say handling these animals requires &ldquo;caution&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And they say further surveillance of wild pangolins is needed to understand their role in the risk of future transmission to humans.</p>
<p>Two groups of coronaviruses related to the virus behind the human pandemic have been identified in Malayan pangolins smuggled into China, said lead researcher Dr Tommy Lam of The University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although their role as the intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remains to be confirmed, sale of these wild animals in wet markets should be strictly prohibited to avoid future zoonotic [animal to human] transmission,&rdquo; he told BBC News.</p>
<p>Bats also contain coronaviruses, which are closer still to the human virus, except in one key area - the part that helps the virus invade cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This tells us that viruses that look pretty adapted to humans are present in wildlife,&rdquo; said co-researcher, Prof Edward Holmes of the University of Sydney. &ldquo;Bats are certainly involved, pangolins may be, but it is very possible that other animal species are involved as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronaviruses under the microscope</p>
<p>Exactly how the virus jumped from a wild animal, presumably a bat, to another animal and then humans remains a mystery. The horseshoe bat and the pangolin have both been implicated, but the precise sequence of events is unknown.</p>
<p>Finding the virus in smuggled Malayan pangolins raised the question of where they contracted the virus, said Dr Lam. Was it from bats along the trafficking route to China or in their native habitats in Southeast Asia?</p>
<p>Calls to end illegal wildlife trade</p>
<p>Conservationists say it would be devastating if the discovery led to further persecution of the endangered mammal. The animal&rsquo;s scales are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicine, while pangolin meat is considered a delicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the time for the international community to pressure their governments to end illegal wildlife trade,&rdquo; said Elisa Panjang of Cardiff University, a pangolin conservation officer at the Danau Girang Field Centre in Malaysia.</p>
<p>China has moved to ban the consumption of meat from wild animals in the wake of the outbreak. Similar moves are being considered in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Prof Andrew Cunningham of Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said it was important not to jump to conclusions from the paper. &ldquo;The source of the detected coronavirus really is unknown - it might have been a natural pangolin virus or have jumped from another species between capture and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dr Dan Challender, of the University of Oxford, said pangolins are known to host various strains of coronaviruses. &ldquo;Identifying the source of SARS-CoV-2 is important to understand the emergence of the current pandemic, and in preventing similar events in the future,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h3 id="coronaviruses-similar-to-the-covid-19-one-have-just-been-found-in-pangolins">Coronaviruses Similar to The COVID-19 One Have Just Been Found in Pangolins</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2020-03/processed/tree_pangolin_inaturalist_congo_republic_1024.jpg" alt="img">
A search for the &lsquo;missing link&rsquo; in the chain of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has uncovered two close cousins of the new coronavirus in shipments of pangolins being smuggled into China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the discovery by researchers from across Hong Kong and China falls well short of identifying these precious mammals as the source of the current pandemic. However, the similarity of the strains does suggest the nation&rsquo;s pangolin market is a time bomb that needs to be defused.</p>
<p>Ever since the nexus for the outbreak of COVID-19 was traced back to a wet market in Hubei province, the search has been on to determine the virus&rsquo;s heritage. Initial studies of SARS-CoV-2&rsquo;s genome suggest it&rsquo;s highly possible that the virus emerged in a colony of horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a province that borders the south-east Asian country of Myanmar.</p>
<p>But if that is the case, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how a bat became a source of infection in a densely populated city more than 1,000 kilometres to the north of its colony.</p>
<p>Granted, stalls in these Chinese wet markets sell a wide variety of live animals for food and traditional medicine, many of them sourced from Asia&rsquo;s tropics. Whether bats of any kind might have been present isn&rsquo;t clear, since the market was cleared long before the first indications of an outbreak were known.</p>
<p>Unlike horseshoe bats, though, the pangolin is almost guaranteed to have been on sale there.</p>
<p>The illicit sale of the endangered mammal - prized as a delicacy and a health tonic - is an &lsquo;open secret&rsquo; throughout much of the nation, and a good place to start hunting for an intermediate host of the zoonotic virus currently wreaking havoc across the globe.</p>
<p>Frozen tissues from 18 Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) were obtained from anti-smuggling operations carried out by Guangxi Customs during 2017 and early 2018.</p>
<p>Coronavirus RNA was found in six of the 43 organ samples, linking the virus with five individual animals. Techniques for reading and filling in missing sequences soon provided the team with half a dozen detailed genomes of the pangolin&rsquo;s strains of the virus.</p>
<p>None were dead ringers for SARS-CoV-2, but there were a number of overlapping sequences that suggest these viruses were fairly closely related.</p>
<p>A second hunt through another batch of pangolin tissues taken from an operation later in 2018 followed, based on the newly acquired genomes. This analysis revealed a further three positive results out of 12 animals.</p>
<p>In addition to these specimens from the Guangxi operation, the team analysed pangolin scales, skin swabs, and unspecified tissues from a separate customs centre in Guangzhou, picked up in early 2019.</p>
<p>Taken together, the mix of newly sequenced coronavirus genomes are all 85.5 to 92.4 percent similar to SARS-CoV-2, and represent two lines of related virus. One of those lines even has a &lsquo;haircut&rsquo; that resembles that of the COVID-19 virus, with remarkably similar receptor-binding spikes jutting from their surfaces.</p>
<p>The results might not be the smoking gun we&rsquo;re hoping for, as the search for the connection between the coronavirus&rsquo;s reservoir and the first humans to be infected continues.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a wake-up call we desperately need. All those animals seized by customs were destined for live animal markets somewhere in China.</p>
<p>As impossible as it is to predict whether those particular lines of coronavirus could have made a leap into the human population, the current pandemic emerged from just such a branch of that family tree.</p>
<p>The sale of pangolins in China is already far from legal, but without the political will to provide the resources necessary to enforce the law, their sale will almost certainly continue to flourish, in spite of recent widespread bans of the sale and distribution of wild meats.</p>
<p>A global pandemic is a tragic incentive to act. But with mounting evidence that pangolins play a strong role in the ecology of such a potential threat, perhaps it&rsquo;s the push China needs to finally get a handle on its illegal animal trade.</p>
<p>This research was published in Nature.
