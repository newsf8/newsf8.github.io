<p>Updated: Jun 24, 2020 18:30 IST</p>
<p>A week after the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) announced that exams for all medical and dental courses will take place between July and August, they released another circular late on Tuesday stating that exams remain postponed until further notice. Authorities at MUHS highlighted how the decision was taken due to the status of Covid-19 cases in the state.</p>
<p>“The decision on exams remain suspended until we hear from the state authorities about the status of Covid-19. Students and colleges will be informed about the same,” stated the circular.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, medical and dental students had requested MUHS that exams be cancelled, especially since many students are already involved in Covid-19 related duties in several hospitals across the state. After authorities refused to accept their request, students sought an extension to the Rs 5 lakh Covid-19 insurance to appear for exams. MUHS had agreed to take this matter with state government, but has not responded on this as yet.</p>
<p>Last week, the university announced that exams will be held but students will have the option of choosing an exam centre closer home since many students are not back at their institutes.</p>
<p>While students and parents are happy with news of the postponement, many have demanded that examinations be cancelled. “These students are risking their own lives and that of their family members by working on Covid-19 relief work. The state should not insist on an exam now. Since all other university exams have been called off, professional courses can also follow the same keeping in mind the health and safety of students,” said Anant Sharma, parent of MBBS student.

<p><img src="https://medicaldialogues.in/h-upload/2020/06/08/130013-exam-instructions.jpg" alt="img">
Nashik: Through a recent notice, the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has instructed its medical colleges for the conduct of pending Internal Assessment examination for Summer 2O2O examinations.</p>
<p>The internal assessment examinations, which are pending due to the present situation during the lockdown , can be conducted as per the simplified procedure (if required) as information attached below.</p>
<p>The simplified procedure has been proposed so that the students are not disturbed during the lockdown period. The students can attend the tests from their places of residence without any additional requirements of computer hardware (laptops, desktops, printers, etc) or software.</p>
<p>All colleges must complete pending internal assessment examinations before 15th June 2O2O.</p>
<p>If lockdown ends in between the ongoing internal assessment examination, institutes have the discretion to shift to routine physical mode, if all students can physically join. The simplified methodology is illustrative. Institutes can change it (Question paper sending, Answer sheet receiving mode, etc) as per their convenience. If any student misses the internal assessment examinations due to any reason, colleges are advised to conduct their examinations after the lockdown period is over, before the final examinations.</p>
<p>All colleges shall send the internal assessment marks of this examination and final internal assessment marks to the University by 30th June 2O2O. The software for submission of internal assessment marks shall be made available from the 15th of June 2O2O. The above circular should be brought to the notice of all students and concerned teachers.</p>
<p>Simplified Procedure for Conducting Summer -2020 Internal Assessment Examinations</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Detailed subject-wise schedule of pending internal assessment examination should be prepared and communicated to concerned students, at least 7 days before the start of the examination. The schedule should be sent by E-mail / SMS / Whats App message. If possible, students may be contacted on their / parents&rsquo; mobile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the colleges may create a separate email lD for each subject/ department for communication with students. For example, the anatomy department in BJ Medical College can create email like <a href="mailto:bjmc_anatomy_ia@abc.com">bjmc_anatomy_ia@abc.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pattern of this internal assessment examination should be similar to the university examination as far as possible. The question paper is set for the marks as per the guidelines. As students are expected to write the answers at their places of residence, so as far as possible, questions are to be framed, which are suitable for open book examination pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may be difficult to conduct a bed-side internal assessment practical examination in the present situation. Also, to conduct the online viva of students has many technical constraints. So same pattern/ methodology can be followed for practical examination. The practical oriented questions can be framed and sent on E-mail / SMS / Whats App. Both the question papers (theory and practical) may be sent at a time by E-mail / SMS / Whats App etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As far as possible, the questions related to the practical session of internal assessment should be framed with intent to assess the practical skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the scheduled date of examination, the question paper is sent to all the students by E-mail / SMS / Whats App group at the time of the scheduled start of the examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will write the answer sheets (theory and practical) and at the end, students shall scan the answer sheets into a pdf file. Such a scanned pdf file shall be sent to the respective E-mail / SMS / Whats App, from which the question paper was sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty in the respective department will complete the assessment and send the marks to MUHS, as per the existing rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before sending the marks to MUHS, students should be informed about the marks. If there is any grievance, it should be sorted out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students can submit the hard copy of (handwritten and matching with the soft copy sent earlier) answer book of Theory and Practical separately to the concerned department and then sign the internal assessment mark sheet, once they report the college after the lockdown period is over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During this lockdown period, the students should remain stress-free. This is a simplified internal assessment examination. If Laptop, Computer, Tablet, and Scanner are not available, then students can take a photograph of their answer page/s on their mobile phone and send it to the concerned teacher for evaluation. Students should write their Roll Number, Subject, Page Number on every page of the answer book and should write all the answers as per the sequence of the question paper and should submit serially. Answers to a new question should be written on a fresh page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This simplified procedure for conduction of Internal Assessment Examinations is a one time measure for the current Summer-2020 examinations in view of the prevailing COVID-I9 pandemic.</p>
