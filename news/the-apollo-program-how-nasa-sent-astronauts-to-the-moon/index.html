<p>In this Apollo 17 onboard photo, Mission Commander Eugene A. Cernan adjusts the U.S. flag deployed upon the Moon during the December 1972 lunar landing mission, which marked the last of NASA&rsquo;s Apollo Moon landings.</p>
<p>The Apollo program was the name of NASA&rsquo;s project to land humans on the moon in the 1960s and early 1970s. With the success of Apollo 11 in 1969, which put astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time in history, the U.S. was able to declare victory in the space race against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1961, the Apollo program consisted of 11 total spaceflights; four of those tested equipment, and six of the other seven flights landed people on the moon, according to NASA. The first crewed flight occurred in 1968, and the final mission occurred in 1972.</p>
<p>By the time the Apollo missions came to an end, 12 astronauts had walked on or driven over the moon&rsquo;s surface, conducting scientific research and snagging rocks to bring back to researchers on Earth. These samples are still being used to make new discoveries more than 50 years after they were collected.</p>
<p>Related: The Moon on Earth: Where are NASA&rsquo;s Apollo lunar rocks now?</p>
<p>The Apollo program grew out of the space race, a contest that began in 1957 between the capitalist U.S. and communist Soviet Union over superiority in space. With the Russians ahead during the start of the race, U.S. President John F. Kennedy challenged the newly created NASA to land men on the moon and return them safely in his famous 1961 &ldquo;Moon Speech&rdquo; at Rice University in Texas.</p>
<p>Preparation for Apollo came from NASA&rsquo;s Mercury program, which ran from 1959 to 1963 and sent one-person crews into orbit to see if humans could survive and work in space. That was followed by the agency&rsquo;s Gemini program, which ran from 1962 to 1966 and included two-person missions that tested many maneuvers and components critical for landing on the moon.</p>
<p>The Apollo program required a monumental effort, employing roughly half a million people in the United States, according to SpaceFlight Insider. The program cost a total of $28 billion over its lifetime, or approximately $283 billion when adjusted for inflation, according to the Planetary Society.</p>

<p>NASA developed several novel vehicles specifically for Apollo, most famously the Saturn V rocket. One of the biggest launch vehicles ever flown, the Saturn V was as tall as a 36-story building and consisted of three stages.</p>
<p>Atop the rocket sat the Apollo command module, a three-person capsule that held the astronauts traveling to the moon and back. The inside of the vessel had about as much room as the interior of a car, making for fairly cramped traveling conditions during the roughly week-long lunar voyages.</p>
<p>Finally, there was the lunar module, which carried two astronauts down to the lunar surface and landed on spindly legs. Once surface excursions were over and astronauts had climbed back inside, the lunar module&rsquo;s top portion fired its engine and ascended to the command module for the return to Earth.</p>

<p>The first Apollo tests took place using the Saturn I rocket, a smaller version of the Saturn V that was used to test out the engines and necessary hardware for the program. The first astronauts were set to fly on Apollo 1, but during a launch rehearsal a wiring spark generated a fire that blazed throughout the command module, which resulted in the tragic deaths of the three-person crew.</p>
<p>The failure was a turning point for the program, resulting in extensive redesigns to the command module. It was more than 18 months before NASA tried to send more humans into space again. During that time, the agency launched six uncrewed missions to investigate the performance of the Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>The first successful crewed launch during Apollo 7 marked the next milestone in the program’s history. Though astronauts remained in Earth orbit for its duration, the mission validated the safety of sending people to space using the Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>Apollo 8 was the first mission to send astronauts all the way to the moon, though the crew did not land on its surface, only circled it. During the event, which occurred on Christmas Eve in 1968, the crew took turns reading from the Book of Genesis and snapped the iconic photo of our planet known as &ldquo;Earthrise,&rdquo; which is credited with helping inspire the environmental movement.</p>
<p>The culmination of Apollo was the Apollo 11 mission, when the first astronauts set foot on the moon. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins flew the command module Columbia over it. Armstrong uttered his iconic words, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,&rdquo; as he stepped onto the moon. The astronauts spent 21 hours and 36 minutes on the surface before returning to the command module.</p>

<p>Apollo 13 is remembered as the flight that was saved from near disaster through hard work and clever engineering workarounds. Though the crew never landed on the moon, their travails were dramatized in the award-winning movie &ldquo;Apollo 13&rdquo; about their misadventure.</p>
<p>By the early 1970s, the high price of the Apollo program and waning public interest led to its cancellation. President Richard Nixon and legislators in Congress decided to redirect Apollo&rsquo;s funding elsewhere, like the Vietnam War. Apollo 17 was the final mission of the program, and the first to include a scientist, geologist Harrison &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Smith, who helped identify important rock specimens to bring home.</p>
<p>NASA is currently planning its Artemis program, which is intended to bring people — including female crew members — to the moon for the first time since the end of Apollo. Artemis aims to have its first landing in 2024 and build toward a sustained human presence on the moon by 2028.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief summary of each Apollo mission:</p>
<p>Apollo 1 — Jan. 27, 1967. Astronauts Virgil &ldquo;Gus&rdquo; Grissom, Edward White and Roger B. Chaffee had all been veterans of NASA&rsquo;s Mercury or Gemini programs. A disaster involving the highly oxygenated air inside their capsule and a stray spark, along with the vessel&rsquo;s hatch being difficult to open from the inside, resulted in the death of all three men.</p>
<p>Apollo 4 — Nov. 9, 1967. Uncrewed first launch of NASA&rsquo;s enormous Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>Apollo 5 — Jan. 22, 1968. Uncrewed mission that brought the lunar module to space for the first time.</p>
<p>Apollo 6 — April 4, 1968. Final uncrewed mission of the Apollo program. The launch was designed to test the ability of the Saturn V to inject astronauts into a lunar trajectory. Severe vibrations of the rocket during launch caused the mission to be only partially successful.</p>
<p>Apollo 7 — Oct. 11, 1968. Astronauts Walter M. Schirra, Donn Eisele and R. Walter Cunningham were the first Apollo crew to go into space. Rather than head toward the moon, the astronauts spent 11 days in Earth orbit testing various components of their command module.</p>
<p>Apollo 8 — Dec. 21, 1968. Astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders became the first humans to leave low-Earth orbit, heading on a trajectory that took them around the moon and back to our planet. Their historic flight happened on an accelerated schedule. NASA officials made a last-minute decision to head toward the moon after only a single crewed mission around the Earth in order to quickly demonstrate technological superiority over the Soviet Russians.</p>

<p>Apollo 9 — March 3, 1969. Astronauts James McDivitt, David Scott and Russell &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Schweickart remained in Earth orbit during their 10-day mission, testing out procedures to dock their command module with the lunar module that would be critical for landing on the moon.</p>
<p>Apollo 10 — May 18, 1969. Astronauts Thomas Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan got extremely close to landing on the moon. Their mission involved flying to our natural satellite and bringing the lunar module to within about 50,000 feet (15,000 meters) of the moon&rsquo;s surface, a mission that served as a dress rehearsal for Apollo 11.</p>
<p>Apollo 11 — July 16, 1969. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin E. &ldquo;Buzz&rdquo; Aldrin and Michael Collins did what no humans had ever done before: reach the moon and have two people walk over its surface. Armstrong and Aldrin left historic boot-prints that still remain in the lunar regolith.</p>
<p>Apollo 12 — Nov. 14, 1969. Astronauts Charles &ldquo;Pete&rdquo; Conrad, Alan Bean and Richard Gordon survived two lightning strikes during liftoff and reached a different spot on the moon than Apollo 11, touching down in a place called the Ocean of Storms. Moonwalkers Conrad and Bean visited NASA&rsquo;s Surveyor 3 probe, which had landed on the moon two years prior.</p>
<p>Apollo 13 — April 11, 1970. Astronauts James Lovell, Fred Haise and John Swigert suffered after an oxygen tank exploded 56 hours into their flight to the moon, crippling the mission. The crew was forced to scramble into the lunar module and use it as a lifeboat, circling the moon without landing and then returning safely to Earth. This was Lovell&rsquo;s second time around the moon, the first being on Apollo 8.</p>

<p>Apollo 14 — Jan. 31, 1971. Astronauts Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell and Stuart Roosa are best remembered for having hit golf balls on the moon. Shepard was the first American in space but he and his co-pilots collectively had some of the least flight experience of all the Apollo astronauts, leading them to be lovingly dubbed &ldquo;the three rookies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apollo 15 — July 26, 1971. Astronauts David Scott, James Irwin and Alfred Worden were part of the mission that carried the lunar roving vehicle, often known as the moon buggy, for the first time to the moon. Their mission emphasized geological work, and the crew was trained to identify different rocks and formations that would help scientists on Earth piece together the history of our planet and its natural satellite.</p>
<p>Apollo 16 — April 16, 1972. Astronauts John Young, Charles M. Duke and Thomas Mattingly landed at the Descartes highlands and searched for volcanic rocks during their mission. Confounding scientists&rsquo; expectations, they found few volcanic samples, indicating that the area had not been formed through volcanic action.</p>
<p>Apollo 17 — Dec. 7, 1972. Astronauts Eugene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt and Ronald Evans became the final people yet to ever reach the moon. Their mission continued the focus on science, with the astronauts spending the most time on the lunar surface and picking up the largest samples of any in the program.</p>

<h3 id="flight-controls-used-by-neil-armstrong-and-buzz-aldrin-to-land-on-the-moon-go-up-for-auction">&ldquo;Flight controls used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to land on the Moon go up for auction&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/02/12/30310788-0-image-a-33_1593689181027.jpg" alt="img">
The flight controls used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon have gone up for auction in America, where they are expected to fetch up to £160,000 ($200,000) each.</p>
<p>The controls, which look like joysticks from a games console, were used to move the Columbia Command Service Module up, down, left and right as it carried the astronauts to and from the Moon in 1969.</p>
<p>They formed an integral part of the Apollo 11 mission, which marked the first time humans landed on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>The rare artefacts will go under the hammer during the Legends &amp; Explorers auction by Beverly Hills-based Julien&rsquo;s Auctions, set to take place on July 17 and 18.</p>
<p>A trio of controllers will go under the hammer between July 17 and 18 in the US. It includes this rotational hand control</p>
<p>The controls were on the Columbia Command Service Module which and were used to move it up, down, left and right as it made its way to the Moon. The landing was made by the Eagle</p>
<p>Two rotational hand controls (RHC) from the flight stations of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and a translation hand control (THC) from Armstrong&rsquo;s station are in the sale.</p>
<p>Each stands about four and a half inches tall and is mounted in a wooden display case with an Apollo 11 badge and official NASA removal tag.</p>
<p>Their purpose was to override the Columbia&rsquo;s autopilot, allowing the crew to carry out precise manoeuvres such as docking.</p>
<p>The RHCs used by Aldrin and Armstrong are expected to sell for up to £160,000 ($200,000), while the THC used by Armstrong is expected to be purchased for up to £80,000 ($100,000).</p>
<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s and Aldrin&rsquo;s RHCs are also fitted with a trigger switch for activating his headset&rsquo;s microphone.</p>
<p>Armstrong&rsquo;s THC also had the capability to abort the Apollo 11 mission during the initial launch phase if the crew encountered a problem, by turning it counter clockwise.</p>
<p>This is a translation hand control used by Neil Armstrong during the crafts manoeuvres</p>
<p>The controls are to be sold by Julien&rsquo;s Auctions and were an integral part of the Apollo mission</p>
<p>An official NASA audit report has corroborated the authenticity of all three items.</p>
<p>Although the Columbia took the astronauts into orbit around the Moon, they touched down on its surface using the Eagle Lunar Module.</p>
<p>During the mission, the astronauts first blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on the Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p>This then detached to allow the Columbia to fly to the Moon, which took three days, before the Eagle headed for its surface.</p>
<p>Baseballs signed by the Apollo 11 crew and original photographs from the mission will also go under the hammer during the auction.

<h3 id="spacexs-1st-astronaut-launch-was-nasas-most-watched-online-event-ever">&ldquo;SpaceX&rsquo;s 1st astronaut launch was NASA&rsquo;s most-watched online event ever&rdquo;</h3>

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, on May 30, 2020, at NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Launch America&rdquo; drew much of the nation in.</p>
<p>On Saturday (May 30), SpaceX launched its first-ever crewed mission , a test flight called Demo-2 that sent NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
<p>The liftoff was the first orbital crewed launch to depart from American soil since NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011. And a record number of people tuned in to watch the milestone online, agency officials said.</p>
<p>Related: SpaceX&rsquo;s historic Demo-2 astronaut mission: Full coverage</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re still collecting the data, but some of our metrics are saying that peak viewership for the joint NASA-SpaceX launch broadcast across all of our platforms was at least 10.3 million concurrent viewers — the most-watched event we’ve ever tracked,&rdquo; NASA Associate Administrator for Communications Bettina Inclán said during a news conference on Sunday (May 31), shortly after Behnken and Hurley&rsquo;s Crew Dragon capsule arrived at the ISS .</p>
<p>To be clear: The record Demo-2 just broke is for internet traffic, not viewership of all kinds. For example, it&rsquo;s estimated that about 600 million people — one-sixth the global population at the time — watched the Apollo 11 moon landing on TV on July 20, 1969.</p>
<p>Several high-ranking American officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, have drawn parallels between the famed Apollo missions and Demo-2, noting that both took place in times of extreme turmoil and division in the United States.</p>
<p>Apollo&rsquo;s backdrop included protests against the Vietnam War and widespread civil-rights abuses. And today the nation is beset by the coronavirus pandemic and social unrest stemming from the tragic May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>The Saturn V rockets that launched the Apollo missions &ldquo;rose above the tumult and the clamor of their times. They were a symbol of national strength and unity,&rdquo; Pence said on Saturday shortly after Demo-2&rsquo;s liftoff. &ldquo;I believe with all my heart that millions of Americans today will find the same inspiration and unity of purpose that we found in those days in the 1960s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SpaceX holds a $2.6 billion contract to conduct six operational crewed flights to the orbiting lab for NASA. If Demo-2 is successful all the way through, Elon Musk&rsquo;s company will be clear to start conducting those contracted missions.

<h3 id="the-false-hope-of-an-american-rocket-launch">&ldquo;The False Hope of an American Rocket Launch&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/prgom6ZArUlLy5QrXuLyE-woJaM=/0x249:2340x1468/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/06/spacetravel/original.jpg" alt="img">
But for most of the 1960s, the majority of Americans consistently believed that the Apollo program wasn’t worth the cost, according to the space historian Roger Launius. On the eve of the Apollo 11 launch, the Reverend Ralph Abernathy, King’s closest friend and second in command, led a group of demonstrators to Cape Canaveral to tell the NASA administrator that the country should focus on taking care of its poor instead of sending people to the moon.</p>
<p>The moon landing in July 1969 certainly captured Americans’ attention, and even, for a brief moment, felt worth the trouble; according to Launius, one poll taken at the time of the landing showed, for the first time, that a majority of Americans supported the effort. The broadcast from the lunar surface drew the largest TV audience in history to date. But the accomplishment didn’t leave the same mark on the American imagination. Where the moon landing took humankind’s exploration of the cosmos to new heights and sparked a generation of engineers, it inspired the poet and soul musician Gil Scott-Heron to write “Whitey on the Moon,” a song that captured the disparate experiences of white and black Americans.</p>
<p>It’s Neil Armstrong’s famous “one small step” line, however, that has impressed itself in the national conscience—and so too the image of a man in a spacesuit next to the American flag. Only many decades later did the public learn of the stories of Ed Dwight, the black man who almost became a NASA astronaut in 1962, or of Katherine Johnson and other black female mathematicians who contributed to the Apollo project, calculating the trajectories of the country’s most important flights beyond Earth.</p>
<p>Read: What will the moon landing mean to the future?</p>
<p>Polls show that support for the moon landing has actually risen over the years; 77 percent of people in 1989 thought the Apollo program was worth it, compared with just 47 percent a decade earlier. It is easy, now, to look back and pull from that moment the glossiest view of America, a pretty lie that sounds better in the history books than the real story. It is easy to say that humanity’s desire to explore the cosmos managed to bring together a divided nation.</p>
<p>Why not now?</p>
<p>On the day of the recent launch, Trump was at Cape Canaveral, vamping from behind a lectern about the state of the space program under his leadership. “When Americans are united, there is nothing we cannot do,” he said.</p>
<p>The threat of white police officers and vigilantes to black communities long predates Trump, to be sure, and platitudes such as this would have felt hollow under the previous administration too. But Trump’s divisive rhetoric has been stoking the unrest. The morning of the launch, before he flew to Florida, Trump had alluded to deploying “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen” against protesters outside the White House. By then, he had already called demonstrators in Minneapolis, where police had killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, “thugs.” Trump had also tweeted that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”—a phrase that dates back to the 1960s, when it was used by a segregationist politician and a white police chief. He was still a few days from threatening the use of military force to “dominate” protesters and staging a bizarre photo op on a sidewalk that law enforcement cleared by teargassing demonstrators.

<h3 id="the-most-amazing-photos-of-spacexs-historic-1st-astronaut-launch-for-nasa">&ldquo;The most amazing photos of SpaceX&rsquo;s historic 1st astronaut launch for NASA&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MqwCiG49rTh5RJxMQYLrH-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
The successful launch of two astronauts on a SpaceX Crew Dragon did not only make history May 30. It also gave us truly spectacular views of SpaceX&rsquo;s Falcon 9 rocket as it launched a crew for the first time.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most iconic shots of the historic launch and mission, which was the first human space mission from NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011.</p>
<p>In photos: SpaceX&rsquo;s historic Demo-2 test flight with astronauts</p>
<p>A distant storm</p>

<p>The weather, as is often the case in Florida, was a concern in the hours before the SpaceX launch. NASA has firmly established protocols about when it is safe (or not safe) to launch, depending on the weather. Here you can see distant storms in the night sky behind the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket the night before launch, on May 29.</p>
<p>Bad weather had already plagued the mission once. Storms delayed a launch attempt days earlier , on My May 27.</p>
<p>A goodbye, with care</p>
<p>(Image credit: Joe Raedle/Getty)</p>
<p>NASA astronauts Bob Behnken (R) and Doug Hurley said a careful goodbye to their families after walking out of NASA&rsquo;s operations and checkout building on their way to the launch pad. Behnken is married to NASA astronaut Megan McArthur and has a young son. Hurley is married to retired astronaut Karen Nyberg and also has a son.</p>
<p>The two astronauts were launching during the novel coronavirus pandemic, necessitating a few extra physical distancing precautions on top of the usual quarantine to keep astronauts safe from viruses.</p>
<p>Tiny people, mighty rocket</p>

<p>Demo-2 astronauts Behnken and Hurley are just barely visible in their white spacesuits at left, inside the fixed service structure servicing their SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket (at right).</p>
<p>The astronauts are shown here on their final walk-up to the rocket in the hours before the launch on May 30. The Falcon 9 rocket stood atop Pad 39A of NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center. It&rsquo;s a historic launch pad that also saw NASA&rsquo;s Apollo 11 moon landing mission launch, as well as many space shuttle flights.</p>
<p>A stormy liftoff</p>

<p>Backdropped by dramatic but non-threatening storm clouds, astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken successfully blast off May 30 en route to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Their launch continued flawlessly, marking the first time the SpaceX Crew Dragon has carried astronauts into space, and the third time SpaceX spacesuits have been used in space (after two missions with dummies.)</p>
<p>The power of Merlin</p>

<p>The nine Merlin engines of the Falcon 9 rocket&rsquo;s first stage spit flame as they launch the Crew Dragon carrying astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on a Crew Dragon spacecraft for NASA.</p>
<p>The rocket would later make a smooth landing on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You. It&rsquo;s black landing legs can be seen folded against its booster hull.</p>
<p>Dignitary viewing</p>
<p>(Image credit: Bill Ingalls/NASA)</p>
<p>In a rare visit from senior politicians, President Donald Trump (right), Vice-President Mike Pence (center) and Second Lady Karen Pence watched the Demo-2 mission make its successful launch May 30. Trump became only the third sitting U.S. president to watch astronauts launch into space from the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p>He follows President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s viewing of Apollo 12 in 1969, and President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s viewing of STS-95 on space shuttle Discovery in 1998. That mission carried John Glenn , one of NASA&rsquo;s first astroanuts, back into space at age 77.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is hoping to get NASA astronauts back on the moon by 2024.</p>
<p>Rocket touchdown</p>
<p>(Image credit: SpaceX)</p>
<p>The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket carrying NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley finished the last part of its mission successfully, by touching down on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You just minutes after launch May 30.</p>
<p>SpaceX touts rocket reusability as a long-term approach to make space exploration cheaper and more sustainable, since launching costs usually gobble a large share of a mission&rsquo;s budget.</p>
<p>Thumbs-up in Crew Dragon</p>
<p>With glowing touchscreens within arm&rsquo;s reach at left, NASA astronauts Doug Hurley (left) and Bob Behnken give thumbs-up while sitting inside the Crew Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p>The astronauts experienced a flawless launch during the first human mission of the SpaceX spacecraft May 30.</p>
<p>Flying over Turkey</p>

<p>In a spectacular example of the new being backdropped by the old, the Crew Dragon spacecraft ( named Endeavour ) approaches the International Space Station on May 31 while being backdropped by coastal Turkey, including the city of Demre and an overall region important to the ancient Roman empire for shipping and trade.</p>
<p>The spacecraft docking took place above the border of China and Mongolia.</p>
<p>A close approach</p>

<p>As the SpaceX Crew Dragon (far right) makes its approach to the International Space Station, at foreground is some of the vital infrastructure used to keep the orbiting complex running. Visible is the Japanese robotic arm attached to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Kibo laboratory module.</p>
<p>The astronauts docked at the Harmony module that connects laboratory modules from the United States, Japan and Europe.</p>
<p>Opening up</p>

<p>The nose of the Crew Dragon spacecraft opens up in preparation for docking May 31, showing the mechanism that would connect it directly to the international docking adapter at the International Space Station&rsquo;s Harmony module.</p>
<p>Inside, NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken monitored the progress of the docking procedure.</p>
<p>Celebrating with SpaceX</p>
<p>(Image credit: NASA TV/Youtube)</p>
<p>A screenshot shows the crew hosting an in-flight event with SpaceX employees (on the ground) on June 1.</p>
<p>Along with the astronauts, stars of the event included a Class of 2020 mosaic honoring students around the world in elementary, middle school, high school and college who were graduating in 2020. It is made up of photos of those graduates submitted to SpaceX and assembled into a mosaic of Earth. They also showed &ldquo;Tremor,&rdquo; a sequined dinosaur toy made by Ty that flew on Demo-2 and &ldquo;Earthie,&rdquo; a plush Celestial Buddy toy that flew on the Demo-1 uncrewed test flight in March 2019 and stayed aboard the station.</p>
<p>A rocket returns</p>
<p>(Image credit: SpaceX via Twitter)</p>
<p>The drone ship Of Course I Still Love You made a triumphant return to Florida&rsquo;s Port Canaveral on June 2 , carrying the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that launched the Demo-2 mission three days before.</p>
<p>As of this writing, it is unclear if SpaceX plans to reuse the rocket once again, or to preserve it as a historical artifact.</p>
<p>Correction: This story was updated on June 9 to reflect that the Class of 2020 mosaic carried by the Demo-2 crew honored the student graduates of 2020 in elementary, middle and high school and college.
