Maduro threatens ‘cowboy’ Trump after drug charges</p>
<p>AP, MIAMI</p>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday stood defiant in the face of a US$15 million bounty issued by the US for him to face drug trafficking charges, calling US President Donald Trump a “racist cowboy,” and warning that he is ready to fight by whatever means necessary should the US and Colombia dare to invade.</p>
<p>Maduro’s bellicose remarks came hours after the US announced sweeping indictments against him and several members of his inner circle, for allegedly converting Venezuela into a criminal enterprise at the service of drug traffickers and terrorist groups.</p>
<p>One indictment by prosecutors in New York accused Maduro and Venezuela Constituent Assembly President Diosdado Cabello of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the military “to flood the United States with cocaine,” and use the drug trade as a “weapon against America.”</p>

<p>The charges are politically motivated, Maduro said, adding that they ignore Colombia’s role as the main source of the world’s cocaine, and his own role in facilitating peace talks between the Colombian government and that nation’s rebels over the past decade.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump, you are a miserable human being,” Maduro said during a televised address. “You manage international relations like the New York mafia extortion artist you once were as a real-estate boss.”</p>
<p>What was some of Maduro’s most venomous rhetoric against Trump also came with a threat of military force.</p>
<p>“If one day the imperialists and Colombian oligarchy dare to touch even a single hair, they will face the Bolivarian fury of an entire nation that will wipe them all out,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Venezuela’s head prosecutor opened an investigation into opposition leader and National Assembly President Juan Guaido for allegedly plotting a coup with retired army general Cliver Alcala, who after being named in the US indictments said that he had stockpiled assault weapons in Colombia for a cross-border incursion.</p>
<p>Without offering evidence, Maduro said that the US Drug Enforcement Administration was behind a plan by Alcala to assassinate him and other political leaders.</p>
<p>The indictment of a functioning head of state is highly unusual and is likely to ratchet up tensions with Washington as the spread of COVID-19 threatens to collapse Venezuela’s shortage-plagued healthcare system.</p>
<p>Maduro has ordered people to stay home in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which officials say has infected 107 people and claimed its first death on Thursday.</p>
<p>Criminal acts to advance a drug and weapons conspiracy that date back to the start of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez’s revolution in 1999 occurred as far afield as Syria, Mexico, Honduras and Iran, the indictment alleges.</p>
<p>US Attorney General William Barr estimated that the conspiracy helped smuggle as much as 250 tonnes of cocaine a year out of South America.</p>
<p>“The Maduro regime is awash in corruption and criminality,” Barr said at an online news conference in Washington. “While the Venezuelan people suffer, this cabal lines their pockets with drug money, and the proceeds of their corruption, and this has to come to an end.”

<h3 id="venezuela-says-us-drug-charges-against-maduro-show-desperation">Venezuela says US drug charges against Maduro show &lsquo;desperation&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/2/14/92055526f7c74db0a33acc3b9e3a1671_18.jpg" alt="img">
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said on Thursday that drug trafficking charges by the United States against President Nicolas Maduro announced earlier in the day showed the &ldquo;desperation&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Washington elite&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Arreaza said the decision by the administration of US President Donald Trump to offer rewards for the capture of Maduro and other high-ranking officials accused of drug trafficking show the administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;obsession&rdquo; with Venezuela, which he said was due to its desire to reap &ldquo;electoral returns&rdquo; in the US state of Florida.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>Trump was &ldquo;once more attacking the Venezuelan people and its democratic institutions, using a new form of coup d&rsquo;etat based on miserable, vulgar and unfounded accusations,&rdquo; Arreaza added.</p>
<p>In an extremely rare criminal case against a foreign head of state, the US Department of Justice indicted Maduro and several of his top ministers after accusing him of leading a cocaine-trafficking group called &ldquo;The Cartel of the Suns&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The US Department of State offered a reward of up to $15m for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Maduro, whose country has been convulsed by years of a deep economic crisis and political upheaval.</p>
<p>The indictment marks a serious new phase against Maduro by Washington at a time when some US officials have privately said Trump is increasingly frustrated with the results of his Venezuela policy.</p>
<p>US Attorney General William Barr, announcing charges that include narco-terrorism conspiracy, corruption, and drug trafficking, accused Maduro and his associates of colluding with a dissident faction of the demobilised Colombian armed group, the FARC, &ldquo;to flood the United States with cocaine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the Venezuelan people suffer, this cabal lines their pockets with drug money and the proceeds of their corruption,&rdquo; Barr said of Maduro and the others who were indicted.</p>
<p>Maduro is already under US sanctions and has been the target of a US effort aimed at pushing him from power. He took office in 2013 after the death of his mentor President Hugo Chavez, a staunch foe of the US.</p>
<p>Other Venezuelan officials whose indictments were announced on Thursday include Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, senior socialist leader Diosdado Cabello, and the chief justice of the country&rsquo;s supreme court, Maikel Jose Moreno Perez, who was charged with money laundering. The US government is offering $10m for information leading to Cabello&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>The US and dozens of other countries have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela&rsquo;s legitimate president, regarding Maduro&rsquo;s 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country&rsquo;s military and by Russia, China and Cuba.</p>
<p>US officials have long accused Maduro and his associates or running a &ldquo;narco-state,&rdquo; saying they have used proceeds from drugs shipped from neighbouring Colombia to make up for lost revenue from a Venezuelan oil sector hit by heavy sanctions by the US.

<h3 id="us-charges-nicolás-maduro-and-other-venezuelan-officials-with-narcotrafficking">U.S. Charges Nicolás Maduro And Other Venezuelan Officials With Narcotrafficking</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400" alt="img">
U.S. Charges Nicolás Maduro And Other Venezuelan Officials With Narcotrafficking</p>
<p>The U.S. government has charged Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro and 14 other current or former Venezuelan officials with narcotrafficking and has offered a $15 million reward for Maduro&rsquo;s capture.</p>
<p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:</p>
<p>The Justice Department unveiled criminal charges today against Venezuela&rsquo;s president, Nicolas Maduro. Here&rsquo;s Attorney General William Barr making the announcement.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>WILLIAM BARR: The indictment of Nicolas Maduro and his co-defendants alleges a conspiracy involving an extremely violent terrorist organization known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the FARC, and an effort to flood the United States with cocaine.</p>
<p>SHAPIRO: Of course, Maduro has driven his country into an economic nosedive over the last few years. The U.S. and other Western countries don&rsquo;t actually recognize him as Venezuela&rsquo;s legitimate president.</p>
<p>NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is here with the latest. Hi, Ryan.</p>
<p>RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.</p>
<p>SHAPIRO: Tell us more about what Maduro is being charged with.</p>
<p>LUCAS: So there are four counts in this indictment, the most serious of which are narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to import cocaine. The Justice Department alleges that for the better part of two decades, Maduro helped run and then lead a drug trafficking cartel made up of high-ranking Venezuelan officials. Court papers say that these officials worked with the Colombian rebel group FARC to move tons of cocaine to the United States, making huge sums of money, of course, for themselves along the way.</p>
<p>This indictment against Maduro came out of the Southern District of New York. Here&rsquo;s how the U.S. attorney there, Geoffrey Berman, put it.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>GEOFFREY BERMAN: Maduro and the other defendants expressly intended to flood the United States with cocaine in order to undermine the health and well-being of our nation. Maduro very deliberately deployed cocaine as a weapon.</p>
<p>LUCAS: Now prosecutors allege that Maduro&rsquo;s operation basically turned a part of western Venezuela into a safe haven of sort, a jumping-off point for drug shipments to the U.S. And Berman said the scope and scale of this trafficking was possible only because Maduro and his co-conspirators used Venezuela&rsquo;s state institutions to provide protection for it all.</p>
<p>SHAPIRO: So who else in the Venezuelan government does the U.S. say was involved in this?</p>
<p>LUCAS: So Maduro is certainly the biggest name here as Venezuela&rsquo;s president, but he&rsquo;s not the only one. There are several senior Venezuelan officials or former officials who have also been indicted. That includes the head of the country&rsquo;s constituent assembly, the former director of military intelligence, another former high-ranking military official. The country&rsquo;s defense minister also has been charged with involvement in drug trafficking. And in a separate case, the chief justice of Venezuela&rsquo;s Supreme Court was charged with money laundering.</p>
<p>Now we know that the U.S. has long had an adversarial relationship with the Venezuelan government. That dates back even before Maduro took power in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez. As you said at the top, the U.S. doesn&rsquo;t recognize Maduro as Venezuela&rsquo;s legitimate leader. Still, Attorney General Barr summed up Maduro&rsquo;s regime this way. He said it is, quote, &ldquo;awash in corruption and criminality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SHAPIRO: The U.S. has been trying to get Maduro out of power for years, leveling sanctions against his administration, supporting Venezuela&rsquo;s opposition. All of that has been unsuccessful. Do you think this move by the Justice Department is likely to produce any different results?</p>
<p>LUCAS: It&rsquo;s hard to see how this would drastically alter the state of play. Maduro, as you said, is still very much in power despite all of the other things that the U.S. government has done to try to help show him the exit. This indictment certainly adds another element to the Trump administration&rsquo;s pressure on Maduro.</p>
<p>But yes, the question of whether this is largely symbolic or whether any of these folks will ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom hangs over all of this. Barr said the U.S. does expect to get its hands on these folks eventually. He wouldn&rsquo;t discuss any possible future steps to try to make that happen, but he did point to the $15 million reward that the U.S. announced today for information leading to Maduro&rsquo;s capture.</p>
<p>SHAPIRO: NPR&rsquo;s Ryan Lucas, thank you.</p>
<p>LUCAS: Thank you.</p>
