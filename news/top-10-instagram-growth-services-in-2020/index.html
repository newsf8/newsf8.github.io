Shares

Whether you’re an influencer, a marketer, or an entrepreneur, you cannot neglect the importance of numbers when it comes to social media.

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms with more than 1 billion monthly users from all over the world. However, not all these accounts are successful since success on Instagram is gauged by the number of followers one has.

The average person has only 100-300 followers, which is not enough for a business. If you want to be successful and reach a wider audience, you will need more followers. This is where growth services come into play.

In this article, we’ll talk about Instagram growth services and help you pick the best one.

Let’s get started:

What Are Instagram Growth Services

Instagram growth services are tools designed to attract more followers. Different tools work in different ways, some give you access to deep analytics to help you understand your audience, some provide tips on hashtags and captions, some allow you to buy fake followers, and offer professional services.

These tools can be both paid and free. It is important that you choose a service that aligns well with your goals and helps you grow organically. Services that offer fake followers aren’t reliable and will not result in real benefits. Fake followers are often deleted by Instagram, as they are against its community guidelines. Buying fake followers can also hurt your account because it breaks Instagrams rules of use.

We’ve covered some of the best Instagram growth services to help you pick the best one. The growth services offer organic, natural looking growth over time to improve your account.

Best Instagram Growth Services

Let’s have a look at the ten best Instagram growth tools for both businesses and individuals. Compare them to pick what suits you the most:

#1 Social Buddy

Social Buddy is a reliable Instagram growth service that offers businesses a chance to increase followers organically. You can start as low as $79 per month and enjoy features such as location and gender targeting, following & unfollowing.

What we like the most about this tool is its ability to target your competitor’s followers. This can give you traction since users who follow your competitors are more likely to be interested in what you offer.

In addition to this, it also offers location features that make it perfect for local businesses. New users can sign up without worries as there are no commitments, you can cancel anytime.

The company offers no fake followers or bots and works quite like a virtual assistant. It targets users who are more likely to convert. A case study from Social Buddy shows impressive growth:

#2 ViralRace

ViralRace can be suitable for users who are in a hurry to reach the finish line. It is easy to set up and you will begin to receive likes, follows, and views within a few minutes of activation.

While it is quite popular among users, it may not be the best option if you want to enjoy organic growth since this platform only lets you buy followers. The good thing is that most followers are real and not bots, however they may not always be interested in what you have to offer.

If you want to test the service, you can start as low as $2. The company offers bundles and individual likes, views, or followers packages as well.

#3 SocialCaptain

With SocialCaptain, you will know exactly what you are opting for as the company offers live demonstrations. The company excels when it comes to customer support, hence you will always have someone to answer your questions.

It works by converting your target audience into followers. You can use locations, hashtags, and even usernames to target users. One of its defining features is niche filtering.

The entire process after this is automated. You will begin to see results in a few days. Plus, since the company offers real-time analytics, you’ll be able to keep an eye on it.

#4 Combin

Combin offers more than just growth. It can also manage your account and improve engagement by using a combination of services including search analysis.

It can be a great pick for social media marketers or individuals who look after a number of accounts since it lets you manage up to15 accounts at a time. Plus, you can even monitor incoming and outgoing activity thanks to detailed activity tracking options.

In addition to this, it has a scheduler that can let you schedule posts in advance. This feature can be of great help when you’re busy but want your page to remain active.

The platform is trusted with more than 60,000 users. It has been mentioned on the likes of Forbes and Search Engine Journal. Plus, it is free to try.

#5 Instazood

When you look at it, you will find that Instazood is like any other service as there’s nothing on paper that sets it apart from other Instagram growth services out there. However, once you start to use it, you will see that it’s better than most similar options due to great customer service and easy to use functions.

You can start for only $2 per month. Each package comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee and 3 day trial. There isn’t much information on how the platform works but we can see that the company automates several functions yet still giving users some control.

It uses bots that can follow, unfollow, and like on your behalf. While using bots can be risky, we’ve found that Instazood works within limits and is secure.

#6 Stellation Media

Here is another botting service but it isn’t like our previous pick. It does not solely count on follow and unfollow tactics to gain followers. This is very important because such tactics are both and old. Instagram does not appreciate spam and accounts that indulge in such activities can get suspended and even terminated in some cases.

Fortunately, there are no such risks when it comes to Stellation Media as it works by utilizing a newly-introduced feature called Mass Story Viewing. Stellation Media is the only company that offers this feature at such a large scale and it appears to be working for the firm.

However, you will have to spend a lot to get access to this feature as their cheapest package costs $199 per month. It comes with analytics and reporting, targeted audience, and email support. According to the company, this package offers moderate growth. Get ready to spend $299 per month if you want fast and advanced results.

#7 HashtagsForLikes

If you have been looking for an option that offers organic growth then consider HashtagsForLikes. This is different from other options on this list as the only aim of this company is to help you identify hashtags to improve your reach and get more likes and followers.

Hashtags can improve engagement by about 12.6%. Plus, longer hashtags appear to offer more benefits but more is not always merrier as engagement begins to decline after 11 hashtags.

Almost all brands use hashtags on Insta as they can help build loyalty and improve brand awareness. About 70% of all hashtags on the platform are branded.

With this tool, you will know which hashtags to use and when. They can help other users find you. Plus, since hashtags work on other platforms as well, you can use this tool to excel on Twitter and Facebook, too.

You can start as low as $15 per week or save money by signing up for $38 per month. In addition to hashtags, the company offers live analytics, performance reports, and tracking.

The platform is easy to use. Open the dashboard, enter your niche, and select from a number of relevant hashtags depending on your requirements. There are several similar services out there, but this one takes the cake as it emphasizes knowing your business and offers targeted hashtags.

#8 Upleap

We know that this is the era of automation yet you will find companies like Upleap that still offer manual growth tools. The company uses real people to get the job done and they appear to be doing quite well. There are several companies that offer manual work but this is one of the few names that give results.

You will get a dedicated account manager to work with you. The platform is easy to set up and offer pretty good results that may take a while to show but the overall ROI is good thanks to excellent targeting.

We’ve found that this option is more suitable for personal accounts and users who want to be influencers. It may not be suitable for big companies or those who have millions of followers.

It is important to be clear about your requirements when working with this company as your manager will work according to your brief. Once you sign up, you will not have to worry about anything as your manager will not only select hashtags on your behalf but can also post to ensure your page remains active.

You will be able to target users and track progress. The company offers a 3 day free trial for users who want to know how the system works.

There are three packages to select from. The cheapest one comes for $39 per month but offers limited features. Get ready to spend $99 per month if you wish to enjoy all the features.

#9 Ingramer

If you want guaranteed results then try Ingramer Instagram growth service. The company promises to double your engagement within a short period of time. According to the company, most users gain about 20,000 likes and 2,000 new followers within a month, however we couldn’t verify these figures.

Ingramer uses a bot to give results. The bot can perform a variety of tasks including auto follow and unfollow, auto likes, and direct messages.

The platform can be a little tricky to set up if you have never used Instagram hacking services in the past. You will need to link it to your account or sign up using your email. The next step involves setting up your campaign that involves setting daily limits, enabling filters, and defining your target audience.

The cheapest package starts for as low as $19 per 2 weeks. You can save money by signing up for a longer time period. However, remember that the cost is for one account only.

#10 Jarvee

Jarvee comes with a free trial and promises to help you post 10 times faster, thus saving you time. It is one of the few options out there that work with almost all major platforms including Tumblr, YouTube, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, Facebook, and Instagram.

While it works, this option has some drawbacks as it needs to run continuously in order to work. The company suggests to install it on a VPS or virtual machine for this purpose, which can add to the cost.

The cheapest package supports 10 social accounts and costs $29.95 per month. If you want more, you can start with a more expensive package.

The best thing about this platform is the tutorials designed for novice users. They explain online marketing and its importance. Go through these resources as they’re worth your time.
