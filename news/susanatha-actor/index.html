<p>June 14, 2020</p>
<p>Mumbai: Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide at his home in Mumbai. The actor was 34. He debuted in Bollywood with ‘Kai Po Che’ and was last seen in ‘Chhichhore’.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home earlier this morning. Some of his friends were also at home when his body was discovered. The door to his room was broken and he was found hanging. Initial reports from the Police say that he was suffering from depression for the past six months. His friends also said that the reason behind this extreme step is depression. A suicide note has not been recovered yet.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had hosted a close group of friends at his home last night, according to sources. This, however, has not been confirmed by any of his friends. He had gone to bed really late and the house help was not surprised that he was not up and about in the morning.</p>
<p>But when he tried to knock on Sushant’s bedroom door around noon, he received no response. That’s when the help called Sushant’s friends, who forced open the door to discover him hanging. A pall of gloom descended upon Bollywood on Sunday afternoon, as soon as the news of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death broke.</p>
<p>Sushant made a name for himself on the small screen, especially with ‘Pavitra Rishta’, where he played the lead role, before jumping to the big screen. Sushant broke on to the big screen with Abhishek Kapoor’s ‘Kai Po Che’, based on Chetan Bhagat’s bestselling book ‘The Three Mistakes of My Life’.</p>
<p>‘Kai Po Che’ catapulted Sushant Singh Rajput, a small-town boy, into almost overnight fame. After 2013’s ‘Kai Po Che’, Sushant worked in ‘Shuddh Desi Romance’ with Parineeti Chopra, and then went on to do several films. He was last seen in ‘Chhichhore’ opposite Shraddha Kapoor. It was a film directed by Nitesh Tiwari, which dealt with college life and the frustrations of the later years.</p>
<p>The actor’s former manager Disha Salian was found dead a few days ago. Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna. His brother Neeraj Kumar Bablu is an MLA. His sister-in-law is an MLC in the Bihar Legislative Council. He is survived by his elder brother, two sisters and father Dr. K.K. Singh. Sushant lost his mother in 2002, when he was only 16 years old.</p>
<p>In several interviews over the years, Sushant had always spoken of the loss of his mother as a huge blow to him. In fact, his last social media post, from June 3, was also a tribute to his late mother. Sushant wrote, “Blurred past evaporating from teardrops / Unending dreams carving an arc of smile / And a fleeting life, / negotiating between the two… Ma.”

Along with the pictures, he wrote, &ldquo;Happy anniversary Amma &amp; Nanna! Thank You for this life Was going through your wedding album &amp; found so many priceless pictures! Will post a few every year.&ldquo;He shared a strip of throwback pictures from his parents&rsquo; wedding in which the couple can be seen standing next to each other along with other family members.
