Google classroom falters, students lose connection</p>

<p>Google Suite, used by many school districts for online learning, experienced a service disruption in some areas, several school districts reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>It is unclear how widespread or long the outage lasted, but the Google Outage Map showed problems along the Northeast on Thursday.</p>
<p>In Trumbull, history teacher Katie Boland said the platform was down for about a half hour around lunch time. Fairfield schools Superintendent Michael Cummings reported the service was back up in his district at 3:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Beside Google Classroom, the outage also included Google Drive, Gmail and YouTube.</p>
<p>Google could not be reached for comment, but a Google spokesman told Business Insider the problem was a router failure in Atlanta, not because of increased traffic due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Cummings and Christopher Cipriano, principal at Notre Dame High School in Fairfield, both use the system to help advance distance learning efforts while students are home during the coronavirus quarantine. They both reported their systems were affected.</p>
<p>Google Classroom is a free web-based service that allows teachers to post, collect and grade assignments, and make announcements. Students can use it to pose questions and make comments.</p>
<p>Students are invited to join a class through a private code.</p>
<p>Jared Ferrari, parent of Liam, a Holland Hill fifth grader in Fairfield, said the system went down for his 11-year-old around noontime, just as he was wrapping up for the day.</p>
<p>“This is probably going to happen more as more kids try to sign on nationwide,” Ferrari said. “It’s kind of going to get crushing.”</p>
<p>Ferrari said his son spends his whole school day on the program, from home room at 9 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. most days. He even has band on the program, and records and uploads music so the teacher could hear it.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Department of Education, on Thursday, said it was not immediately aware of the situation and could not say how many districts used Google Classroom or were impacted by the service interruption.

CLEVELAND, Ohio &ndash; Kids are learning from home while schools are closed for the coronavirus pandemic. That means parents are suddenly teachers. And you may not have the technical training for the job.</p>
<p>As the shutdown stretches, schools are transitioning lessons into online platforms, using Zoom meetings and Google Classroom.</p>
<p>So how do you navigate your child’s virtual Google Classroom?</p>
<p>On Google Classroom, teachers can post videos and assignments, which kids can complete and turn in with the click of a mousepad.</p>
<p>Cleveland.com’s John Pana has a video explaining step-by-step how it works.</p>

WITH schools across the country closed until further notice, the task of homeschooling your kids can be a daunting one.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>3 Parents can use Google Classroom to help make homeschooling easier Credit: EPA</p>
<p>Google Classroom is designed to improve the home learning experience for both parents and children.</p>
<p>Here Fabulous Digital guides you through how to use the VERY simple app.</p>
<p>What is Google classroom?</p>
<p>Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate and stay organised.</p>
<p>3 You can create your own classes in the app where you can upload assignments and lesson material Credit: EPA</p>
<p>You create projects and assignments within the app and can then share them with your kids over email with deadlines.</p>
<p>Google Classroom uses Google Docs meaning that you can go completely paperless with your learning.</p>
<p>How do I use Google Classroom?</p>
<p>The app is completely free and can be downloaded from the Google Play app store.</p>
<p>It can be used on a laptop, smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Simply create dedicated folders for each of your child’s subjects and you can upload worksheets and tasks to each of these folders for your kids to complete.</p>

<p>This means that you can monitor what work has been completed - and chase up any late submissions.</p>
<p>If you want to put your kids knowledge to the test you can create your own quizzes on the Google Forum</p>
<p>How can I set Google Classroom up?</p>
<p>Begin by visiting the website classroom.google.com.</p>
<p>There you can set up a free account using your email address.</p>
<p>Create classes by clicking the “+” button in the top right hand corner and selecting “create a class.” Fill in the details according to the subject.</p>
<p>You can add assignments to each “class” by clicking “updates” and then the “+” button.</p>
<p>Add lesson material using your Google Drive - this could be worksheets, or a YouTube video.</p>
<p>You can then invite your kids to your class by getting them to sign into the classroom with the unique code you have shared with them.</p>
<p>Google Classroom creates a Drive folder for each new class you make - the folders appear as “class tiles”.</p>
<p>All of your assignments and lesson material will be saved to each tile with any work your kids complete being saved there too.</p>
<p>Is Google Classroom any good?</p>
<p>Parents who have used the app have praised its structure when it comes to home learning.</p>
<p>Reviewing the app, one mum wrote: “If you don’t have Google Classroom, you really do need it. It helps you keep up with all of your work.”</p>
<p>Agreeing a second said: “Allows my daughter to connect with school and allows her to catch up with missing work.”</p>
