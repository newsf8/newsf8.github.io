Questions linger on how the Internal Revenue Service will process and distribute relief checks approved as part of the massive economic stimulus package that the House is expected to pass Friday and President Trump is expected to sign.</p>
<p>The $2 trillion stimulus package the Senate passed late Wednesday will give checks to Americans to help alleviate the financial burden from business closures aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said during a White House briefing on Wednesday night that he would like to distribute the checks within three weeks for those who have deposit information on file with the IRS.</p>
<p>“This is the kind of thing that the IRS does this really well, in the sense that you give it this challenge and it drops everything and it marshals its forces around it,” said Center for Taxpayer Rights Executive Director Nina Olson, who was the head of the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent organization within the IRS that helps people resolve tax problems, for 18 years. Additionally, the agency has “had the experience” of giving out stimulus checks in 2001 and 2008.</p>
<p>However, unlike 2008, the agency is trying to get the checks out immediately, so the IRS is allowing individuals to use their fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2019 tax return information. Olson said this will make it “a lot simpler&hellip;[because] it’s data that they’ve got.” However, a challenge could be that if the IRS uses 2018 information, individuals’ bank accounts or addresses could be outdated.</p>
<p>Similarly, Olson said while it’s good that the bill has a provision saying the IRS can use Social Security or retirement benefits forms to find where to send checks, it could be a challenge to find current addresses and bank accounts for those who work and don’t make enough to file tax returns and/or aren’t receiving such benefits. In addition to the text of the bill, “they’re going to have to put out more guidance because of these pockets of taxpayers that we don’t have information on or they have old information on.”</p>
<p>Also, the modified operations due to the coronavirus are “ a huge challenge” because the IRS suspended in-person visits, has reduced phone service and is encouraging people to use online services, which may be difficult for older people. “In 2008, there were something like almost 30 million calls that came in to the dedicated economic stimulus payment line,” Olson said. “That really caused the phones to not be answered even when the IRS was staffed. So when you’re looking at the budget cuts since 2008 plus the fact that so much of your workforce is not going to be answering the phones because they’re not set up to answer them from home, you’re not going to be able to get through.”</p>
<p>Lastly, she added the IRS is dealing with a “difficult tax season,” as it was extended to July 15. The IRS is also only in the second year of the president’s tax system overhaul and has faced severe staffing and budget cuts. The National Taxpayer Advocate stated in its 2019 annual report to Congress that since fiscal 2010, the agency&rsquo;s budget had decreased by about 20% and there were about 20% fewer employees. Meanwhile the number of tax returns the agency received increased by 9%.</p>
<p>The $250 million in the stimulus package for the IRS is “helpful” to compensate for the cuts, but Olson noted the agency does difficult work and future hiring could be complicated by the logistics of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In response to Government Executive’s questions on how the agency will distribute the checks, an IRS spokesperson pointed to a website that will have updates on the stimulus payments as they become available. The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The check amounts the IRS will distribute depend on how much individuals make and how many children they have. Those who made less than $75,000 in fiscal 2019 will be eligible for the full payment of $1,200 and for every child will receive $500. For salaries above $75,000, The Washington Post created a calculator to estimate what you will receive.</p>
<p>“For the vast majority of individuals, the IRS has to figure out how to put households together and then figure out a way to get money to them,” Mark Mazur, a former IRS and Treasury official, told Bloomberg News. “The idea that IRS has this all-knowing view of what your family looks like is just not true.” The outlet reported it could take weeks, not months, for checks to process.</p>
<p>In addition to former officials, the National Treasury Employees Union (whose 150,000 members include about 47% IRS employees) addressed the situation the IRS is facing in commending the Senate for passing the legislation.</p>
<p>“We urge Americans to think of the IRS employees who will process these stimulus checks–and others across the federal government–who are still on the job providing necessary services to protect our public health, the economy and our security,” NTEU President Tony Reardon said in a press release on Thursday. “Many federal workers are able to telework during this crisis and continue providing services that American taxpayers depend on.”

Stimulus Payments</p>
<p>How large would the payments be?</p>
<p>Most adults would get $1,200, although some would get less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment would be an additional $500.</p>
<p>How many payments would there be?</p>
<p>Just one. Future bills could order up additional payments, though.</p>
<p>How do I know if I will get the full amount?</p>
<p>It depends on your income. Single adults with Social Security numbers who are United States residents and have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less would get the full amount. Married couples with no children earning $150,000 or less would receive a total of $2,400. And taxpayers filing as head of household would get the full payment if they earned $112,500 or less.</p>
<p>Above those income figures, the payment decreases until it stops altogether for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. According to the Senate Finance Committee, a family with two children would no longer be eligible for any payments if its income surpassed $218,000.</p>
<p>You can’t get a payment if someone claims you as a dependent, even if you’re an adult. In any given family and in most instances, everyone must have a valid Social Security number in order to be eligible. There is an exception for members of the military.

<h3 id="stimulus-checks-wont-go-to-these-taxpayers-thats-unjust-opinion">Stimulus checks won&rsquo;t go to these taxpayers. That&rsquo;s unjust (opinion)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200326093948-woman-walking-0324-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
Tim Breene is the CEO of World Relief, a global Christian humanitarian organization that serves refugees and other immigrants in the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.</p>
<p>In the midst of this economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, there is broad bipartisan support in Congress to provide payments to American taxpayers to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus. Among other components of the nearly-$2 trillion relief package negotiated in the US Senate, the agreement announced Wednesday morning reportedly will include checks of $1,200 to most American adults. These funds are supposed to help those who are out of work to pay for food and lodging and to stimulate the contracting US economy, encouraging people to spend even while they are stuck at home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Senate proposal does not include all taxpayers. Those who file their taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) instead of a Social Security number have been left out , according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Omitting these taxpayers will exclude many of the American taxpayers who are most vulnerable in the current crisis: undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Failing to aid these workers will be disastrous to them and their families and will have a significant negative impact on the economy.</p>
<p>If the Senate bill is passed without amendment by the House and signed by the president, it will not be the first time that taxpayers who file their taxes with an ITIN will not receive stimulus checks. In 2008 , when our country issued similar checks, not only were taxpayers who filed with ITINs excluded &ndash; so were those with a valid Social Security Number who jointly filed a return with a spouse with an ITIN (with a limited exception for military families).</p>
<p>In hindsight, it&rsquo;s clear immigrants suffered disproportionately as a result of the Great Recession. For example, in 2008 alone, Hispanic immigrants&rsquo; unemployment rate jumped from 5.1% to 8% , a significantly greater increase than among other American workers.</p>
<p>Since 1996, ITINs have been issued by the IRS to individuals ineligible for a Social Security Number &ndash; mostly (though not exclusively) because they are immigrants who are undocumented.</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage these undocumented immigrants to file and pay their taxes, the IRS has long highlighted that it maintains a wall of separation from the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for immigration enforcement. &ldquo;We want your money whether you are here legally or not and whether you earned it legally or not,&rdquo; IRS Commissioner Mark Everson said in 2007 . Even in an era of increased rhetoric about immigration enforcement, federal tax law continues to prevent these taxpayers&rsquo; information from being shared for immigration enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>These unauthorized immigrants are concentrated in the industries likely to be most immediately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Though only about 5% of the US labor force overall is undocumented, they make up 10% or more of those working in the accommodation and food preparation and service sectors. The women and men who clean hotel rooms are either being laid off or are having their hours dramatically reduced . In addition, servers, cooks and dishwashers are all among those likely to be let go due to this crisis. They need economic relief urgently.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, I know that lower-income people &ndash; including most who would pay their taxes with an ITIN &ndash; are the most likely to quickly spend a stimulus check, precisely because they do not have the financial margin to save. If $2,200 was sent to a single parent with two children who was previously earning $12 per hour, they would likely use the funds to buy groceries, pay a cell phone bill or cover a car, rent or mortgage payment. This is the money which continues to circulate in the US economy.</p>
<p>Unlike those with significantly higher earnings, hourly workers generally are not in a position to simply save those funds for a rainy day &ndash; that rainy day has come and the water is up to their necks.</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants &ndash; who are contributing taxes yet are generally ineligible for social safety net programs, such as food stamps, subsidized housing or Medicaid &ndash; are among those most at risk of hunger or eviction from their homes in the current crisis. Given that many lack medical insurance , they are also least likely to seek and receive health care if they contract COVID-19. Roughly 5 million US-born children of undocumented immigrants will also bear the weight of these impacts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dismissing the reality that these immigrants have violated US immigration law, either by entering the country unlawfully or overstaying a temporary visa. Like other evangelical leaders at World Relief, I have opposed calls for amnesty, arguing instead for a restitution-based immigration reform , that establishes a process by which undocumented immigrants could get right with the law if they pay a penalty for their violation of law.</p>
<p>Were Congress to take up such reforms, our experience at World Relief providing legal services to tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants suggests most would be eager to pay such a fine and make amends. But in the midst of this crisis, congressional action on immigration reform is not likely to happen quickly.</p>
<p>What can happen is that Congress can acknowledge that these undocumented immigrants have complied with IRS requirements to file and pay their taxes utilizing an ITIN. We should be fair to these American taxpayers, among the most vulnerable at all times but more so now. Congress should move quickly to send stimulus checks &ndash; and send them, in particular, to these uniquely vulnerable taxpayers.
