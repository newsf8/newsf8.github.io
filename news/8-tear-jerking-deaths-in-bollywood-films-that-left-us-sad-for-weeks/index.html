<p>Bollywood films are popular across the world for their nail-biting action and musicals. However, some films are definitely known for so much more - from being critically acclaimed to being made on a unique subject. However, another thing Bollywood is great at delivering is bad news in the shape of shocking deaths of characters in films we so often get attached to.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 8 films with characters that were killed off in an intense and yet deeply saddening turn of events.</p>
<ol>
<li>Movie: Ghajini</li>

His back story reveals his erstwhile life and his meeting with Kalpana. The two fall for each other despite initial rifts, however, Sanjay does not reveal his true identity to Kalpana. In the end, when she&rsquo;s killed by the mafia ringleader Ghajini, she dies without knowing Sanjay&rsquo;s true identity. The scene was incredibly sad and one can easily remember the spine-chilling background score Kaise Mujhe as Sanjay remembers Kalpana at the end of the film.</p>

<h3 id="abhishek-bachchan-says-he-struggled-to-get-his-debut-film-i-forget-how-many-producers-and-directors-i-met-and-requested">&ldquo;Abhishek Bachchan says he struggled to get his debut film: ‘I forget how many producers and directors I met and requested’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/01af0dd4-b468-11ea-b8d7-dab47869eae4.jpg" alt="img">
Abhishek Bachchan, who has completed two decades in Bollywood, has been chronicling his journey on social media. In his new Instagram post, he revealed that he struggled to get his debut film, ‘despite trying very hard’. He said that he approached many producers and directors but nothing worked out.</p>
<p>In the post, Abhishek said that he was supposed to start his career with filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra in 1998. “Many don’t know that in 1998 @rakeyshommehra and I wanted to start our film careers together. Him directing me in a script we both worked on called “Samjhauta Express”. Both not able to get anyone to launch us despite trying very hard. I forget how many producers and directors I met and requested to give me an opportunity to act. But to no avail! We both were friends and decided that we would develop something that Rakeysh could direct and I would act in and that’s how Samjhauta Express was conceived,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Samjhauta Express got shelved but Abhishek’s look for the film helped him land the lead role in JP Dutta’s Refugee, which marked his big screen debut. “Rakeysh went on to make Aks with my father and I was luckily spotted by JP saab. He liked my ‘look’, I had grown my hair long and a beard for SE. JP saab was thinking of making Akhri Mughal ( a historical ) and was on the lookout for a young fresh face… I got lucky. He never made Akhri Mughal but made Refugee instead,” the actor said.</p>
<p>Abhishek and Rakeysh finally got a chance to work together in Delhi-6, which also starred Sonam Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman and Rishi Kapoor. “Such a beautiful cast. We were all like one big family, always together even after wrap. Great senior actors that I could have only dreamt of acting with. Such a special experience,” he said.</p>

<p>Abhishek also talked about his other release in 2009 – R Balki’s Paa. He shared screen space with his father Amitabh Bachchan, who incidentally played his son in the film. “Paa, saw me reunite with my Pa! Our 6th film together. My first with Balki and second with @balanvidya also my first film as a Producer. It was such a unique concept and so sensitively handled. Only by the quirky mind of Balki! The film went on to great box-office success and won several awards for everyone,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Paa also won Abhishek his first National Award, as a producer. “We also managed to win 3 National Film awards. @amitabhbachchan for best actor, Arundhati Ji for supporting actress and yours truly, as producer, for best film (Hindi) all of it entirely due to Balki. None of it would have been possible without his vision and conviction. I’m told dad and I even hold a Guinness book of world record for our film,” he added.</p>

<h3 id="sushant-singh-rajput--ankita-lokhandes-most-romantic-scenes-from-pavitra-rishta">&ldquo;Sushant Singh Rajput &amp; Ankita Lokhande&rsquo;s Most Romantic Scenes From &lsquo;Pavitra Rishta&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/dr375nh8d9iinqzh_1592302100.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg" alt="img">
The internet was taken aback after the tragic news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death broke. The Chhichhore actor reportedly died by suicide in his Bandra residence on June 14, 2020, which has left the entire film fraternity aghast. Soon after the news of his demise broke the internet, deepest condolences from fans, friends and his colleagues started pouring in on social media, mourning the death of the gem of an actor.</p>

<p>Taking a look back at Sushant Singh Rajput career trajectory, the actor shot to fame and went on to become a household name across the country after starring in one of Zee TV&rsquo;s most popular soap opera&rsquo;s Pavitra Rishta, produced by the TV Czarina Ekta Kapoor.</p>
<p>Sushant starred alongside her then-ladylove and television actor Ankita Lokhande in the lead role in Pavitra Rishta. The daily soap was an adaptation of the South Indian Tamil TV show, Thirumathi Selvam. Alongside Sushant and Ankita, Pavitra Rishta&rsquo;s cast comprised other famous television actors too, including Rithvik Dhanjani, Asha Negi and Karan Veer Mehra to name a few.</p>
<p>Sushant essayed the role of Manav Deshmukh and Ankita Lokhande essayed the role of his wife Archana Deshmukh in the soap opera. While the Kedarnath actor was a part of Pavitra Rishta for three years, i.e. 2009-2011 and was later replaced by Hiten Tejwani, Ankita Lokhande has been a part of the show from its inception to its conclusion.</p>
<p>However, the on-screen chemistry of the then off-screen lovebirds Sushant and Ankita had the entire country swooning over their stellar camaraderie. Thus, for cherishing the good old Pavitra Rishta days and to commemorate late Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s impeccable performance as an actor, here are some of the best romantic scenes of Manav and Archana from the daily soap.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s last film will be the coming-of-age romantic film titled Dil Bechara. The Mukesh Chhabra directorial is based on John Green&rsquo;s popular novel, The Fault in Our Stars which released in 2012. Alongside late Sushant Singh Rajput, the film also stars Saif Ali Khan and debutante Sanjana Sanghi in the lead roles.</p>
<p>The film was earlier slated to release at the box office on May 8, 2020, but its release got pushed due to the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the new release date of the film has not been announced by the makers yet.</p>

<p>Since few days, Ekta Kapoor has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Her web show ‘XXX Uncensored’ Season 2 landed into controversy. It all started with YouTuber and ex-‘Bigg Boss 13′ contestant Hindustani Bhau who took to his Instagram handle to slam her for allegedly disrespecting the Indian Army. He even filed a police complaint against Ekta and also asked her to apologise. Apart from Bhau, there were others who felt that Ekta demeaned the army with obscenity and offensive content.</p>
<p>Now, Mukesh Khanna has lashed out at Ekta on his YouTube channel. He said in his video that Ekta’s web-series showed the Indian Army in a bad light. He said that from big makers to others, everyone is silent when one maker has disrespected our Indian Army and National Anthem and we can’t do anything. “We should feel ashamed of this content,” he said.</p>
<p>Mukesh also questioned the government and censor board as to why there are no rules or laws on this content. He also slammed the shows on OTT platforms that have no restrictions. He said, “I am with Hindustani Bhau and others who have raised their voice against such content. Who has given you permission to disrespect Indian Army?”</p>
<p>You can watch the full video here.</p>
<p>The scene for which this entire controversy started was of actors Ribbhu Mehra and Aaditi Kohli. In the episode, it is shown that in the absence of Aaditi’s husband, she invites Ribbhu, makes him wear her Army officer husband’s uniform and they have sex.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mukesh Khanna slammed Ekta for ruining ‘Mahabharat’ that was produced by her.</p>

After reaching his home in the National Capital Region (NCR), Karanveer shared his experience of boarding a flight amidst the health scare. “Mumbai airport had thermal screening and a self declaration of good health on the Indigo app. Arogya Setu app is a must, which should say you are in good health. Self boarding passes from kiosks, 7kg-hand baggage to be carried in the craft, 8 and above to be checked it, proper social distancing, followed even while waiting for the flight and while boarding (with) 5-6 feet gap maintained. PPE kits given by staff at boarding gates (shield and cloves),” he wrote.

The actor also thanked all the staff members for “taking care and doing their job so diligently”. He also mentioned about the changes in exit.

By the way lots of flights (were) cancelled at both the airports (Delhi and Mumbai), so just please do a web check in before,” Karanveer shared. “Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata” fame actor Rohan Mehra is also back with his family in Amritsar, and that too after six months.
