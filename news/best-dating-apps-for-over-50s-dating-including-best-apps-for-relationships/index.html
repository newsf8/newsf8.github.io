<p>If you’re looking for the best mature dating apps for relationships or just to reconnect, we’ve rounded up a few that can help you find love</p>
<p>Dating at any stage of life can be daunting, but perhaps mature dating is particularly tricky for those who’ve been out of the game for years, if not decades. But there are apps that offer over 50s dating, and over 60s dating, that will help you meet like-minded people your age without having to sift through countless profiles.</p>
<p>Once you’ve tried some of the best mature dating apps and found a friendly face to talk to virtually, or even meet face-to-face, how do you date successfully and safely in the current climate? “Being unable to meet may actually be a blessing in disguise for daters hoping to forge a stronger foundation and deeper connection,” says Nadia Deen co-founder of Intimology Institute. “We can’t just rely on physical feelings, which can be distracting.”</p>
<p>“It also gives you the opportunity to focus on deal breakers [such as living arrangements and finances] and what you want and need – this will dictate the app you use,” says Nia Williams, founder of Miss Date Doctor relationship counselling service.</p>
<p>Here, our experts show you how to navigate senior dating apps with confidence, and offer advice on whether you should pay for dating apps, as well as tips on safety and how to present yourself. Then, when you’re go to go, browse our selection of mature dating apps.</p>
<p>How to date successfully</p>
<p>“The current climate provides a great opportunity for you to spring clean your online dating profile,” says Match’s dating coach Hayley Quinn. “Profile pictures make a big difference to success so have at least three good photos. If you don’t have a great selection get your phone on a timer, or ask a friend for help. Ideally, pictures should be shot in natural light and show you clearly – no hiding behind sunglasses or artistic photo angles!”</p>
<p>Hayley also recommends writing an attractive profile that isn’t too generic. “Make sure your online dating profile is specific. For instance, instead of saying you love travel, say what your favourite travel experience has been.”</p>
<p>How to date safely</p>
<p>Safety is key – don’t think because you’re older you won’t be catfished (deceived) or even assaulted. “When the time is right remember to meet in a public place and keep friends and family updated,” says Hayley. “If someone is pushy when it comes to meeting beware! Any serious, and respectful, potential partner will be happy to get to know you online first.”</p>
<p>Audrey Lindt, author of the memoir Misadventures in Mature Dating (read about Audrey’s success, below) recommends that you’re mindful. “Don’t share anything sensitive with someone you’ve just met online – even if you think you can trust them. Sharing bank details, credit card pictures or your signature is a big NO. You’re not a bank, and if your beau asks for money to bail them out refuse. This is when you will see who you’re really dealing with.” Audrey also suggests using sites where “friends or people you know have met their match”, to be wary if a suitor refuses video calls or if their conversation “feels scripted” or “too good to be true”, and to check they have “normal jobs and lives”. And while digital intimacy “can be thrilling and something you’ve missed, unless you completely trust him save this for when you’ve met.”</p>
<p>How to date virtually</p>
<p>“Video dates can be a great way to build a connection online,” says Hayley. “Having a longer period of courtship where you spend time getting to know someone, as opposed to making a decision based on first impressions, is very helpful when it comes to making better choices.”</p>
<p>There’s no rush, though. Nadia suggests you only video call when you’re ready “and you’ve spent some time getting to know them [by messaging and phone calls] and feel ready to take it to the next level, then use the opportunity to feel out whether you’re attracted to them and if there’s a vibe.”</p>
<p>So, what makes for a successful video call? “This is the equivalent of a real first date so make an effort,” says Nadia. “Schedule a date and time and don’t be late – just like a physical date. Wear something you feel attractive and comfortable in, consider your surroundings – is your background neat and tidy? – and have a list of conversation topics.”</p>
<p>Don’t think you have to go down the conventional route, either. “You could conduct a virtual cocktail hour, play a game of charades, or cook dinner ‘together’ online,” says Hayley. “Set your laptop or device up at eye level, and make sure there’s a flattering light source!”</p>
<p>Signs that they’re looking for a relationship</p>
<p>While all dating apps can lead to companionship, sex or marriage, if you’re looking for love over 50, or an enduring relationship, Hayley recommends you “prioritise using dating apps that ask detailed user questions as opposed to swiping style apps.” Once you’ve signed up she advises you to “look out for profiles that are complete, and first messages that show the person has read your profile. Weed out any copy and paste ‘Hey, great picture, how are you?’ messages in favour of people who comment on something specific. The most valuable way someone shows they’re interested is that they consistently send you high quality messages that ask sincere questions and show a real desire to get to know you.”</p>
<p>While it’s easy to be put off by poor photography, Hayley suggests not judging too soon. “Sometimes people, particularly single men, can be a lot better in real life but are somewhat camera shy with a limited selection of pictures!”</p>
<p>Is it worth paying for dating apps?</p>
<p>One question that regularly arises is whether people are more serious about finding somone to settle down with if they pay for a dating app. “In theory, it’s worth paying – you pay for things that you really want, right?” says Nadia. “However, I tend to expect more when I’ve paid, a better quality of daters and some magic way of guaranteeing that I’ll find the love of my life. This is unrealistic. People on dating apps are only as good as their intentions. If I’m serious about looking for love and someone else is serious about looking for sex then it’s not going to work.”</p>
<p>“There’s a saying that people don’t appreciate what they get for free,” says Duchess Iphie, sex coach at Duchess’ Secrets. “This may be true in the dating world but we can find love anywhere and on any dating app. I’d recommend using a mixture of paid and free dating apps – you may decide you don’t want a serious relationship and would like to indulge in something more casual; having access to a variety enables you fully to decide what you are truly looking for.”</p>
<p>What to consider before using dating apps</p>
<p>Joan Price, senior sexpert for Hot Octopuss Senior Sex Hub offers these dating tips for mature daters.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what you’re looking for, you won’t find it.</p>
<p>If you don’t ask for what you want, the answer is no.</p>
<p>The first date isn’t an audition for the rest of your life, it’s an audition for the second date.</p>
<p>There’s no such thing as a bad date – only good stories.</p>
<p>Every person who isn’t right for you gets you one step closer to someone who is.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the most important thing to remember when dating even when you are over 50 is to be safe, comfortable and your authentic self!” says Iphie.</p>
<p>Which dating apps are best for over 50s and over 60s dating?</p>
<p>“Dating in your 50s isn’t as challenging as some think,” says Nia. “When it comes to dating apps approach them in the same way you would an interview. Present yourself in the best way you can, research your date, and don’t give up at the first hurdle. Age should be no barrier to finding love and happiness.”</p>
<p>“It’s a brave new world for most seniors looking for love/sex/companionship after decades of being in a relationship,” says Joan. “They find themselves widowed or divorced, or their partner dumped them, or they did the dumping.” Watch Joan’s webinar How the Heck Do I Date at This Age? for tips.</p>

<ol>
<li>Best for offering a broad reach: Match</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest online dating websites, Match is great for all ages. You can be specific and find matches using the criteria search, browse through members’ profiles, or opt for ‘zen mode’ – which means you’ll only be contacted by those who meet your criteria. “It’s important that any platform you use has enough potential matches so you can attract a broad dating pool. Over 1.6 million people have already met their partners on Match, and this is a great dating app for people living in regional areas,” says Hayley. “They also moderate all their profiles making it a really safe site to use.”</p>
<p>“A highly recommended starter for anybody over 50 – when you’re using dating apps older people tend to be less tech-savvy so some platforms don’t enough options, but Match eradicates this issue,” says Nia.</p>
<p>How much does Match cost?</p>
<p>It’s free to register so you can browse members, but a subscription enables users to read messages and chat with other singles. One month costs £29.99 a month; three months costs £19.99 a month; six months costs £9.99 a month.</p>

<li>Best for an entirely 50+ audience: Lumen</li>
</ol>
<p>Lumen is the first dating app specifically designed for over 50s. Combining the technology and ease of modern dating apps like Tinder with features that over 50s find important, the app is designed to help you meet like-minded singles. Lumen’s focus is on safety and quality; every user is verified and must have at least three photos on their profile. Quality conversations are encouraged with longer icebreakers and detailed dating profiles. And to make it easier for those less technologically savvy, the platform verifies every single photo of a person to ensure its authenticity. “Lumen is great option for over 50s – it’s modern and free to use. They also have a great blog offering advice for over 50s dating.” says Nia.</p>
<p>How much does Lumen cost?</p>
<p>Free membership allows you to start six conversations per day or upgrade to 12 conversations per day if you subscribe for £24.99 per month.</p>
<p>Number of users</p>
<p>More than 1.3 million users.</p>

<li>Best for those looking for a serious relationship: eharmony</li>
</ol>
<p>More than two million people have found love through eharmony, which proudly claims it’s certified as the ‘No.1 trusted dating site’. On the whole, it’s great for those looking something long-term. Anyone who signs up needs to fill in an in-depth questionnaire to determine their personality traits, then the eharmony team will send you compatible matches daily, based on your profile, eliminating the need to trawl through masses of members.</p>
<p>How much does eharmony cost?</p>
<p>Basic membership is free, but you’ll need to sign up to premium membership for unlimited access to matched profiles and customised messages. Subscription costs between £44.95 for one month, down to £7.95 per month for 24 months depending on how many months you subscribe to. Premium members also have access to its new Video Date feature.</p>
<p>Number of users</p>
<p>More than 3.5 million members.</p>
<p>How to cancel</p>
<p>You can terminate basic membership at any time. To cancel premium membership via the website go to ‘manage profile’ then ‘amend subscription’. You’ll have access until the end of the agreed minimum term but won’t be refunded. If you don’t want to renew membership, tell eharmony before the renewal date or it automatically renews. If you’ve subscribed via the app, go to your subscription page in the App Store (Apple) or Google Play Store (Android) to cancel.</p>
<p>SIGN UP TO EHARMONY via the eharmony website; on an Android device; or on an Apple device.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Best for those after a divorce or bereavement: Silver Singles</li>
</ol>
<p>Whereas Match and eharmony are for all ages, this dating platform is designed for those over 50 and above who are looking for love. New sign-ups complete a questionnaire that assesses their preferences, personality, and lifestyle in great detail, which allows the site’s matching algorithm to make intelligent pairings, giving users a better match. This set-up is designed to take the stress out of matchmaking and – as your photos can only be viewed by paying members – more privacy. It also has an international reach, with users in Europe, Australia, USA and Canada.</p>
<p>How much does Silver Singles cost?</p>
<p>Basic membership is free and gives limited access to features and profiles. Premium membership costs from £44.95 a month for three months; £34.95 a month for six months; and £24.95 a month for 12 months.</p>
<p>Number of users</p>
<p>50,000 monthly paying members globally.</p>
<p>How to cancel</p>
<p>You can cancel free membership at any time. Premium members who cancel their automatic renewal will have access until the end of the agreed minimum term but won’t be refunded.</p>
<p>SIGN UP TO SILVER SINGLES via the Silver Singles website. Download the app, which is only available to premium members, on an Android device; or on an Apple device.</p>

<p>Case study: Audrey Lindt, 63, author of Misadventures in Mature Dating</p>
<p>“I hadn’t given much thought to dating apps, my divorce came through and I was immersed in my work. It was my daughter who set me up on one. The first guy I met seemed lovely, and after a few weeks we arranged to meet, but as I was due to fly he called saying he was stuck at the airport and needed money to be released. It was then I realised I’d been catfished. I continued on that dating app but unfortunately each suitor turned out the same; they’d get your attention, flatter you, build a relationship and then ask for money. When I refused, they’d try to make me feel guilty or get aggressive.</p>
<p>“I decided to try my luck on Tinder. A colleague of mine had friends who’d met their partners there. My line of questioning was always ‘where do you live and what do you do?’ This cut the chancers out. If the conversation continued, I’d ask to meet on video, as a test. If they had broken phones or couldn’t and I pushed the issue I never heard from them again.</p>
<p>“I had all but given up meeting a nice person and deleted the other apps but Adrian seemed nice and normal. I liked him and in minutes he asked if he could call. We chatted on FaceTime and it turned out we had a shared passion – golf. We met that afternoon then he called me every day and we got to know each other. As the weeks passed we found we could talk about anything and everything and, if I didn’t agree with something, he’d listen. We’re very much going with the flow and have both agreed we’re at the age that we shouldn’t do anything we don’t love. The minute we don’t enjoy it anymore we will stop and that was a year and half ago.”

<h3 id="dear-annie-are-there-any-real-people-on-dating-sites">&ldquo;Dear Annie: Are there any ‘real’ people on dating sites?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/CI_DI9cMXK8XxR05dAOnL5NJpYs=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/6PWAWGTKTFHOZF4VJALHFHE3VU.png" alt="img">
Dear Annie: Would you happen to know a dating site that isn&rsquo;t crazy expensive and that would allow me to find someone who&rsquo;s not fake? I&rsquo;m looking to meet someone real, preferably someone who loves animals like I do. I&rsquo;d appreciate any help you can offer. &ndash; Just Me in Germany</p>
<p>Dear Just Me: There are plenty of dating websites that offer free basic memberships and affordable premium memberships, such as OkCupid (which is free to join, and $5.95 per month for six-month premium subscription) and Plenty of Fish (also free to join, with premium memberships available for $5 to $10 a month). Though it&rsquo;s not a dating site, MeetUp.com offers opportunities to meet people who share similar interests, and you might consider volunteering somewhere that allows you to work with animals and meet like-minded folks.</p>
<p>As for verifying whether someone&rsquo;s the real deal, a few practical tips: Look them up on social media; FaceTime, Skype or Zoom with them rather than just messaging; and, of course, always, always meet in a public place.</p>
<p>Dear Annie: I am a 92-year-old lady, and have outlived my child, immediate family and many dear friends. Sadly, I&rsquo;m writing you after hearing of a 90-year-old friend who tried to commit suicide but was saved.</p>
<p>This friend no longer has family. She has a lot of back pain and age-related problems that most of us get in later years. We are all isolating ourselves due to the pandemic, and sometimes our loneliness is more than we can bear. I&rsquo;m writing to let people know to please, please remember to call often to these lonely souls or stop by to say, &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; or send over a few cookies or a flower from your yard. Just keep in touch to give them a sense of worthiness. I&rsquo;ve talked to other elderly persons going through this, and some have admitted crying themselves to sleep at night or just sitting all day doing nothing. Please remind folks to check on the elderly, especially those living alone. &ndash; Soon to Be 93</p>
<p>Dear Soon to be 93: This is heartbreaking. I am so sorry to hear that your friend felt such despair that she tried to take her own life. And I&rsquo;m deeply sorry to hear that you&rsquo;ve lost so many, including your child, over the years. Your letter is a powerful reminder to check up on older relatives, friends and neighbors, even if just to say, as the great John Prine put it, &ldquo;Hello in there.&rdquo; It takes so little effort to pick up the phone, and yet it can mean so much.</p>
<p>Call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for guidance and resources to help your friend.</p>
<p>Dear Annie: I donated my $1,200 to our local museum. All museums have been closed for the past months with no income but still have utilities to pay and usually at least one staff member.</p>
<p>Not being considered essential, museums have been ignored. But saving history is important, too. We will regret it if the museums have to close forever. &ndash; Shirley in Rochester, IN</p>
<p>Dear Shirley: According to MarketWatch, 90% of museums around the world closed during the pandemic, and 1 in 8 may never reopen. We should all consider financially supporting museums in our communities if possible. As artist and writer Maira Kalman said: &ldquo;A visit to a museum is a search for beauty, truth, and meaning in our lives. Go to museums as often as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="the-best-dating-apps-for-2020">&ldquo;The Best Dating Apps for 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_in/guide/t/the-best-d/the-best-dating-apps-for-2020_12bk.1200.jpg" alt="img">
Bottom Line: From its clunky user experience to its confusing economy, Zoosk is a basic, surface-deep dating app that offers nothing its superior competitors don&rsquo;t do better.</p>
<p>How to Choose the Right Dating</p>
<p>Looking for Love?</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a long-term relationship or a quick booty call, there&rsquo;s a dating app out there for everyone. From the hyper-specific—FarmersOnly, JDate, 3Fun—to the ones we review here, which cast a wider net, what do you need to know to find the love of your life…or just your love for the night? Bars, nightclubs, and other traditional meeting places may be starting to reopen, but how safe are they? Dating sites and apps are the way to go these days, and many even have special video services they&rsquo;ve introduced specifically to deal with dating in the time of the coronavirus, as we&rsquo;ll explain later.</p>
<p>Getting Started With Dating Apps</p>
<p>The first thing you need to decide is how committed you are. As in, how much do you want to pay to make your heart go pitter-patter? Some apps, like Plenty of Fish, let you view profiles and send messages for free. Most of the others let you view your potential matches without charging, but they make you pony up and subscribe if you want to actually reach out to them without limits—especially if the interest is one-sided. While the monthly charges for the apps we review here range in price from $10 to more than $40, most offer a discount if you commit to a long-term subscription such as six months or a year. (You&rsquo;re not afraid of commitment, are you?)</p>
<p>Then there are all the add-ons. Options—letting you pay to boost your ranking in search results, letting someone know that you are really, really interested in him or her or them, or undoing a dreaded left-swipe that was supposed to be a right-swipe—will cost you extra. While some apps may advertise themselves as free, all of them will try to get a buck from you in the end. Only Facebook Dating is totally free, and that’s only if you don’t consider your existing personal Facebook profile data to be currency.</p>
<p>Selling Yourself</p>
<p>When it comes down to actually putting yourself out there and creating a profile, all apps ask for the basics: name, age, location, a photo, a short blurb about yourself, and (usually) if you can stand a person who smokes. Beyond that, it can be a bit of a crapshoot. Some apps, like Tinder, value photos over personality. Others, like eharmony, make you fill out an endless questionnaire before you can even think about browsing for your match. Still others, like Zoosk, ask so little that you&rsquo;re left to wonder what&rsquo;s being used to actually match you with like-minded love-seekers.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t fall into the cis-hetero dating pool, most of the apps reviewed here are inclusive. Even eharmony now finally allows for same-gender couples. However, some are friendlier to the LGBTQ community than others. For example, OkCupid goes beyond forcing users to choose between being a male or female, including options like Hijra, genderfluid, and two-spirit.</p>
<p>Time to Connect</p>
<p>Once you pick that perfect selfie and write paragraphs to sell all your best attributes to your future mate, it&rsquo;s time to start browsing. This is where the big differences between these apps are apparent. For instance, Tinder, with its famous hot-or-not swiping interface, makes it quick and easy to find your next date. Bumble, on the other hand, puts all the power in women&rsquo;s hands; men can&rsquo;t even contact a woman unless she&rsquo;s expressed interest first. Others, like Match and OkCupid, have robust profiles that let you dive deep into a user&rsquo;s personality (or at least the one he or she has decided to present to you), before you decide to go on the pursuit. Hinge lets users create profiles that are a beautiful blend of visuals and text.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve perused the dating pool and have your eyes on that special someone, it&rsquo;s time to bite the bullet and actually reach out to them. Each app offers different ways of showing your interest. Match will let you Wink at a fellow member for free, and Plenty of Fish doesn&rsquo;t charge for messaging. In most apps, messaging is also typically free when both users like each other. However, free users only get so many likes per day, with Hinge being especially limited. In other instances, you&rsquo;re going to get charged for the reach-out. If you&rsquo;re not ready to express your feelings in words, Bumble lets you send Bumble Coins to prospective matches, for $2 a pop. Zoosk offers the slightly creepy option of giving Coins to other users to express your interest (for an additional fee, of course).</p>
<p>Staying in Touch</p>
<p>As this is 2020, all of these services, even the decades-old Match, offer both iPhone apps and Android apps. Most also have desktop counterparts for when you&rsquo;re at work and want to take a break from your spreadsheet to set up a weekend tryst. Just be aware that the functionality can vary substantially between the app and desktop interfaces. For example, there&rsquo;s no swiping on Tinder&rsquo;s browser version. Facebook Dating and Hinge are only available as mobile apps.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed these apps and signed up for the services, get ready for a barrage of notifications and email. Some, like daily match suggestions, are helpful, while others, like alerts that tell you every new &ldquo;like&rdquo; you get, can just be annoying. The good thing is you can easily tweak these alerts by drilling down into the settings menus in each of the apps.</p>
<p>Any activity that involves meeting strangers from the internet carries some safety risks. If you find yourself in a toxic situation and need to cut off contact, all of these apps let you block and report users who haven’t taken the hint. These services try to vet their profiles and keep unwanted inappropriate material from appearing. Bumble blurs nudes with AI. Tinder lets you secretly alert emergency services if you’re on a particularly bad date. There are even third-party solutions. UrSafe is a hands-free, voice-activated personal safety app with features for offline and online dating. Not having to use your hands is especially appealing during a viral pandemic, which brings us to our next section.</p>
<p>Dating While Social Distancing</p>
<p>In case dating wasn’t difficult enough, right now our social lives have all been upended by the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. Ideally, online dating should lead to meeting up in real life. However, right now the responsible thing for everyone to do is to stay home, and that’s creating quite a dilemma for dating apps. Fairytrail, a dating app for connecting via shared travel destination dreams, has seen a bittersweet increase in use.</p>
<p>The most straightforward virtual dating solution is video chatting, allowing users to at least see each other face to face instead of just through texting. Bumble, eharmony, Match, and Plenty of Fish all offer video chat. Apps with more specific target audiences are also adopting this feature, including the mobile-only Muslim dating app Muzmatch.</p>
<p>Even apps without video chat acknowledge the crisis in their own way, though. Hinge lets users set up a video chat, just on a different app. Tinder lets you match with college classmates or people in other countries for free for a limited time. OkCupid added personality questions about how you’re coping with the pandemic. Facebook Dating users can choose to use other Facebook communications apps such as Messenger or the experimental Tuned, an app specifically for quarantined couples.</p>
<p>Which Dating App Should You Use?</p>
<p>Dating is hard work, so we did some of the legwork for you by taking a deep dive into nine of the most popular apps. We weren’t popular enough to get into The League, the dating app for celebrities. Everyone&rsquo;s needs and wants are different, so not every app will be a great fit for you. Match and Tinder are both Editors’ Choice picks because they excel in their respective lanes, lasting relationships and fast hookups. Other apps have strengths too, and you can learn more by reading our in-depth reviews. If we can help play a part in uniting you with your forever person or your Friday-night fling, we&rsquo;re here to help. Just don&rsquo;t forget to invite us to the wedding. (With a +1.)</p>
<p>For more takes on dating, check out our sister sites, AskMen and Mashable. AskMen has plenty of slices of the dating pie, including the best sites for men and women, but also sites specifically for teens, hooking up, and finding relationships. Mashable also offers its own takes the best dating sites for men and for women, but it also adds tons of narrower slices, including the best for geeks and nerds and the best for LGBTQ people—and plenty more, too.

<h3 id="soulmates-changed-our-lives-couples-look-back-at-the-guardians-dating-service">&ldquo;Soulmates changed our lives: couples look back at the Guardian&rsquo;s dating service&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792a112c06b8cd76ad9aaefcb2c9b1190ffbc1b0/0_90_2146_1288/master/2146.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=aabdb1337b8717f0d6cdae4896ed694a" alt="img">
Soulmates has closed down. But its legacy lives on, as these now married couples can testify</p>
<p>After more than 15 years of online dating, Guardian Soulmates has come to an end.</p>
<p>The service, providing a means for single Guardian readers to meet like-minded individuals, started as a lonely hearts column in the Noticeboard in the early 1990s. Here are some of the couples who came together through the platform over the years.</p>
<p>Claire and Jon Blakeway</p>
<p>“After a bad start with a bloke who put his rollerblades on the table and talked about only having 10% body fat, I was ready to drop the date I had lined up with Jon,” said Claire Blakeway from Cheltenham.</p>
<p>Forty-four-year-old communications worker Claire met Jon, also 44, who works in advertising, in December 2011 on the South Bank in London. Fortunately, this date worked out a bit better: “We had a fun evening and I was quite smitten,” said Claire. “He walked me back to Waterloo station at the end of the evening and we had a kiss under the big clock.”</p>
<p>Their relationship progressed and the couple were married in April 2015. They now have a three-year-old daughter named Lois. “I feel lucky to have found Jon,” said Claire. “He had set his parameters on Soulmates to finding a woman within a half a mile radius of his flat – I was fortunate to be living in his tight catchment area.”</p>
<p>Jane Tyndall and James Simcock</p>
<p>“Online dating wasn’t something I thought I would ever do,” said Jane Tyndall, 62, a retired deputy headteacher from Liverpool. “But at the time it was a sad part of my life – I had lost my father and my mum had a serious accident and didn’t know who I was – so I thought I would do something different.”</p>

<p>Jane met James Simcock, 63, a retired lecturer in June 2010. “I agreed to meet him for a coffee in Waterstones,” recalled Jane. “I figured it was a safe place, but also I thought that a man who likes books can’t be all bad. I drove home later that day thinking there was every possibility we would have a second date.”</p>
<p>When James first saw Jane’s profile, he thought she had a wonderful smile. “Having been a Guardian reader for 40-odd years, I thought the only way I was ever going to really find that special person was on Guardian Soulmates,” he said. They both later discovered that they had been living within three miles of each other for 20 years.</p>
<p>“We were sad to read of Soulmates’ demise,” said Jane. “Neither of us would’ve assumed we would try online dating, but it was the best thing to happen to us. Were it not for the Guardian, we would never have met and our lives would not be as wonderful as they are now. We’re still in the honeymoon period of our relationship, but we are definitely soul mates.”</p>
<p>Jessica and Chris Treen</p>
<p>“I’m tight and didn’t want to pay the £25 to join up, so I guess I owe the Guardian now,” said Jessica Treen from Stretford, who only got as far as a free trial.</p>

<p>Jessica, 37, met Chris, 39, a writer, in 2009 after a friend suggested she try Soulmates. “I had just moved back to Manchester after four years in London and was feeling like my whole life had shifted backwards. I put only slightly more than zero effort into my profile and the only photo I thought was acceptable was one of me scowling by a water cooler.”</p>
<p>However, soon after, she received a message from Chris. “He told me he was idly scrolling through the site and joined up because he liked my photo,” recalled Jessica who works in radio. “Because I hadn’t paid, I could only choose from one of six pre-written replies. We tried to arrange a date, but the process was long-winded. In the end I Googled him and managed to find his blog and email address.”</p>
<p>The couple have been together for 11 years and married in 2014. “Back in 2009 there was still a bit of stigma surrounding online dating, and we didn’t really want to tell people how we met. However, now Guardian Soulmates is going, it seems awfully romantic – a badge of honour somehow.”</p>
<p>Neha and Simon</p>
<p>“I wasn’t very impressed at the time,” said Londoner Neha, 34, speaking about the first time she met Simon on a rainy in day in north London.</p>

<p>“It was the end of a working week and Simon was a bit grumpy on our date. I left thinking I was never going to meet him again,” she said.</p>
<p>Simon, 36, a psychotherapist, felt very differently about their 2014 meeting. “I knew from the first moment that she was the one I’d been looking for.”</p>
<p>Neha said: “It’s been an interesting relationship as I’m Indian and he’s British, and during our time together Simon’s come to recognise his privilege as a white man. He’s known about how other people can be affected, but it’s not really impacted him before. This is especially felt because of our experience with the Home Office and me applying for a spouse visa – one time they wanted proof that I spoke English even though I studied for my PhD in the UK.</p>
<p>“We’ve learned a lot about what it means to live as an interracial couple. I never wanted to live here, but I’m here now and we’re really happy.”</p>
<p>Helen and Annie Marshall-Cole</p>
<p>“I could only have half a pint as I was driving, but we talked for about four hours,” said swimming teacher Helen Marshall-Cole about her first date with her now wife, Annie.</p>

<p>Helen, 42, from Brighton, met Annie, 49, an employment lawyer, at a local pub in 2011. “I was living in a converted Bedford horse box on a farm in Sussex, while studying and working part-time,” said Helen. “Annie was staying in a friend’s spare room while job hunting. I kept chickens at the time and told Annie how I had found one of them in bed with my lurcher dog. We laughed all evening.”</p>
<p>The couple got married in 2016 in Hawaii. “We were in love very quickly,” said Helen. “Our families were very supportive, but some friends took against the relationship because I was known as a ‘new age traveller’, someone who lived in vehicles, and she came from a privileged background – but we proved them all wrong.”</p>
<p>Helen and Annie, who have adopted two children, were sad to hear Soulmates was going. “It allowed us to meet as we had similar beliefs and interests despite our very different backgrounds,” said Helen. “Neither of us would have used any of the new dating apps. Soulmates changed our lives for the better.”

<h3 id="its-not-a-good-time-to-be-an-nhl-free-agent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a good time to be an NHL free agent&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thetelegram.com/media/photologue/photos/cache/milan_lucic10259_46468445-e1593640240289-20200701190011jpg_medium" alt="img">
A A</p>
<p>There was no free-agent frenzy on this Canada Day.</p>
<p>Player agents weren’t talking to general managers to finalize signings, Sportsnet and TSN didn’t have 101 commentators talking about unrestricted free-agent centre Derek Grant giving it another whirl with Anaheim Ducks and PR people weren’t lining up calls with Oilers GM Ken Holland.</p>
<p>It was all quiet on July 1 because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Free-agency starting date will now be in October — or maybe Nov. 1, a few days after the NHL draft — accompanied by the usual speed-dating process with some of the 300 UFAs to see if any are interested in a relationship, all of them knowing there’s only so much food on the table. The salary cap will be $81.5 million US for the next two seasons. It is not a good time to be a free agent, a big name or a smaller one, although we’ll see with Alex Pietrangelo and Taylor Hall.</p>
<p>“From what I understand, all player contracts (that normally ended June 30) will be rolled over until Nov. 1 so that’ll be the old July 1,” said Rick Valette, whose Octagon agency represents Oilers’ Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Leon Draisaitl.</p>
<p>Until COVID-19, most thought the salary-cap ceiling would be around $84 million or so for 2020-21.</p>
<p>Then the new TV deal (U.S. rights) could have added another $6 million to $8 million to the cap, so about $92 million in a few years.</p>
<p>Not now. Unrestricted Oilers free agents Mike Smith (signed last July 1), Riley Sheahan and Tyler Ennis could have been signing here or elsewhere July 1, but not now.</p>
<p>Instead of the free-agent doors swinging open July 1, players such as Connor McDavid ($13 million) and Draisaitl ($7 million) were due huge signing bonuses. McDavid’s base salary is $2 million for the 2020-21 season, same as Draisaitl’s. The owners haven’t been making any money for over three months, but it was expected the bonus payouts (also $1 million for Zack Kassian and Kris Russell, too) wouldn’t be delayed.</p>
<p>“Some players may want the (signing bonus) money in their hands and other may want to defer it because of escrow (20% next season),” said a prominent agent.</p>
<p>“Right now,” added Milan Lucic’s Edmonton-based agent Gerry Johannson, “we’re just giving our players guidance that it could be a tough year (negotiating). We’re telling them that this is the year to take a deal even if it’s not the one you might want. It’s like musical chairs. There are 100 players and only 75 chairs.”</p>
<p>Because of the NHL’s work stoppage on March 12, there was no draft a week ago. No July 1 raft of player signings. In 2013, it was pushed back to July 5 after the lockout season, but that was only four days later. This will be three months or more.</p>
<p>“Usually by July 1, most deals with teams are either done or wrapping up stuff and on July 3 and July 4, we’re calling teams and saying: ‘Please sign our guys,’” said The Sports Corporation’s Johannson with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Then after that, you’re going with hat in hand saying: ‘Any chance you might want to sign my guy?’ I always say we’re heroes on July 1. It’s fun, and on July 5 we’re lined up at the doors like everyone else.”</p>
<p>Before, teams were allowed a public romancing period with UFAs after the draft, where they could go and visit a few cities, agents and managers were doing the framework of deals quietly. But four years ago, Johannson was finalizing Lucic signing his seven-year, $42-million July 1 contract.</p>
<p>“Milan had visited cities. He spoke to Vancouver and Montreal. Wayne Gretzky had called him (coming to Oilers). He picked the Oilers because he had a relationship with Peter (former GM Peter Chiarelli),” said Johannson.</p>
<p>“Right now, we don’t have many unrestricted free agents. It’s about getting extensions for guys like Ryan Getzlaf and Brendan Gallagher, coming up to the last year of their contracts,” he said.</p>
<p>Same with Valette and Nugent-Hopkins. The Oilers forward has another season on his seven-year deal at $6 million per, but as of July 1, the team and the agent are normally allowed to start talking a new deal.</p>
<p>“Edmonton is the only team that can sign Nuge as of July 1, 2020, under the old rules if life was normal. So he’d be eligible for an extension and we’d be talking about that,” said Valette.</p>
<p>“As agents, this is all new to us. We should have been coming home from Montreal (for the draft), and the teams should have sent out qualifying offers for their restricted free-agents to keep their rights. But that’s been put off. July 1 for me usually means getting to my office at 7:30 a.m., and talking on the telephone all day long.”</p>
<p>Johansson spent June 30 in Vancouver doing the CHL import draft with his junior expert Scott Bonner, taking his first trip in three months. He wasn’t talking to NHL GMs. Same with Newport Sports agent Pat Morris.</p>
<p>“This is the first time in 35 years I’m not working on July 1,” said Morris, who represents Oilers’ Alex Chiasson and Canucks goalie Jakob Markstrom, one of the prized 2020 UFAs.</p>
<p>“Normally on July 1, I’m making calls to GMs. Now I can make them, but I’ll see if anybody answers. They’ll be on the golf course.”</p>

<h3 id="a-rate-reduction-or-lower-monthly-payment-alone-may-not-be-reason-to-refinance">&ldquo;A rate reduction or lower monthly payment alone may not be reason to refinance&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6OQH5RVUZMI6VLFF5O3D2J7B74.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Both the 20-year loan and 15-year loan offer significant interest savings. Closing costs will be rolled into the loan. Which would be the best option for us?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>A: It seems to us that you have made it a priority to live mortgage-free. It’s a terrific choice for many homeowners, even at today&rsquo;s historic low interest rates.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Given your preferences to pay down your mortgage as fast as you can, we suggest you move forward with the 15-year loan. With the 15-year loan, you’ll be mortgage-free by at least 2035, or perhaps even a few years earlier if you continue to make an extra payment per year. With your current loan, you’ll be mortgage-free no later than 2041. And on your current path, you will save at least six years of interest payments.</p>
<p>We generally think a home-run refinancing is when you can lower your monthly payments (excluding real estate taxes and homeowner’s insurance), lower your overall interest rate, reduce the time it will take to pay off the mortgage, and start enjoying the benefit of the savings within six to nine months of the loan closing.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>A rate reduction alone may not be sufficient for us to recommend that you refinance your loan. Frequently, the loan closing fees can be greater than the savings you&rsquo;d achieve with a loan refinancing and in that case, the rate reduction is not enough.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>A lower monthly payment alone is also insufficient to justify refinancing a loan. Let’s say you’re 10 years into your 30-year loan. If you refinance now to lower your monthly payments, but add 10 more years to your loan, those additional 10 years may cause you to pay much more than the savings you are getting from the monthly payments. (If you’re going through a cash crunch, lowering your payments may be enough of a reason to refinance.)</p>
<p>If you find a refinance opportunity that gives you a lower interest rate and lower monthly payments, and you can pay off the loan on or before the time your original loan payoff date would occur, you might be golden.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The one exception has to do with loan closing fees. Those expenses can mount quickly, which is why it’s important to watch how much you’re being charged. For example, if your loan closing fees are $1,000 and your monthly payment goes down by $100, it will take 10 months until your “savings” equals the out-of-pocket costs for the refinance. If, however, your loan closing costs are $6,000, it will take you five years to end up even. We’d rather see you recoup any out-of-pocket closing costs within the first year after a refinance.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Don’t confuse closing costs with other out-of-pocket expenses you’ll have to pay upfront, such as taxes, insurance escrows and other costs in the decision about whether to refinance. That’s not the right way to think about it. You’ll pay those costs no matter what. We know that many borrowers will say that their monthly payment is $1,000 and include in that amount the principal repayment, interest, tax escrow and insurance. But when you’re trying to figure out what you want to do, you shouldn’t factor in the tax and insurance escrows. Just look at the principal and interest part of the payment so your comparison is apples to apples.</p>
<p>We also know that many of our readers believe you should take out as big a loan as possible and for as long as you can and use that money to invest in the stock market.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Let’s say you borrowed the money at about 3 percent and you can use that cash to invest in stocks and earn 8 percent. That would be neat, right? But some of our readers can’t stomach any sort of risk when it comes to their homes. These readers would prefer to know that they have paid off their mortgages, that no longer have to deal with a mortgage lender and that they own their homes free and clear.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>We also have plenty of readers who will take out a mortgage and never prepay that loan. They will feel that they’ve borrowed money at a cheap interest rate and use the extra cash to either save for retirement or invest in or perhaps buy another property. They hope that by leveraging historically low interest rates, they’ll make their money work harder for them.</p>
<p>How much risk are you willing to take? Will you sleep at night if you invest the difference and the stock market declines by 30 percent, as it did at the start of the coronavirus pandemic? Or, will you sleep better knowing your home is paid off?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Only you can decide what&rsquo;s right for your financial and personal life.</p>
