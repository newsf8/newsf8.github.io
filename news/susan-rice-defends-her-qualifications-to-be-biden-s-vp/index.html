<p>Former White House national security adviser Susan Rice on Sunday defended her qualifications to become presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, arguing she had accumulated substantial campaign experience despite never having held elected office.</p>
<p>The remarks from Rice, Biden’s former Obama administration colleague, came on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” after host Andrea Mitchell asked her how Americans should feel about potentially supporting a vice presidential candidate with no background in electoral politics who had not previously run a national campaign.</p>

<p>“Well, Andrea, let’s not get ahead of ourselves here, right?” Rice replied. “Joe Biden needs to make the decision as to who he thinks will be his best running mate. And I will do my utmost, drawing on my experience of years in government, years of making the bureaucracy work.”

Former national security adviser Susan Rice on Sunday said the Trump administration&rsquo;s narrative on the Russia bounty plot doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t buy this story that [Trump] was never briefed,&rdquo; Rice, who served as former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s adviser from 2013–2017, said in an interview with Andrea Mitchell on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meet the Press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a president who is doing our arch-adversary&rsquo;s bidding,&rdquo; Rice said. &ldquo;And he is surrounded by sycophants and weaklings who aren&rsquo;t doing their jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Russia allegedly paid bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill US troops in Afghanistan. The White House has claimed Trump was never briefed on the intelligence, but recent reporting suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>Former national security adviser Susan Rice on Sunday excoriated the Trump administration over the Russia bounty plot, accusing President Donald Trump of doing &ldquo;our arch-adversary&rsquo;s bidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former Obama administration adviser rejected the White House&rsquo;s assertion that President Donald Trump was never briefed on the intelligence suggesting Russia was paying bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill US troops in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t buy this story that [Trump] was never briefed,&rdquo; Rice said in an interview with Andrea Mitchell on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meet the Press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that over a year ago &hellip; my successor John Bolton would have walked straight into the Oval Office, as I would have, and informed the president of this intelligence,&rdquo; Rice added.</p>
<p>—Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) July 5, 2020</p>
<p>Trump was briefed on the intelligence by Bolton in March 2019, according to a recent Associated Press report, and the intel on the suspected Russian bounty plot was also reportedly included in the president&rsquo;s written daily briefing in late February this year.</p>
<p>The intelligence on the plot was gleaned from interrogations of captured Afghan militants and criminals, according to reporting from The New York Times, which was bolstered by electronic data intercepted by American officials showing large financial transfers between Russia&rsquo;s military intelligence agency and a Taliban-linked account. The White House has not taken any known responses to the alleged Russian plot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None of this adds up&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Trump administration has downplayed the intelligence, rejected reports on the intel as unsubstantiated, and repeatedly said the president was never briefed on it.</p>
<p>Trump has suggested the intelligence is &ldquo;Fake News,&rdquo; even though the White House last week said the president has now been &ldquo;fully briefed&rdquo; on the matter. The administration has also been briefing members of Congress on the intelligence.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has a photo-op at St. John&rsquo;s Episcopal Church with Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Adviser Robert O&rsquo;Brien, and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany during ongoing protests over racial inequality on June 1, 2020. Tom Brenner/Reuters</p>
<p>Trump has garnered a reputation as a president who&rsquo;s averse to details and doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to or read briefings. He&rsquo;s also been accused by critics of behaving in a subservient manner to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and CNN recently reported that Trump&rsquo;s angry reactions to intelligence warnings on Russia led his national security team to brief him less and less on Russia-related threats to the US.</p>
<p>Along these lines, Mitchell on Sunday asked Rice why Trump did not raise the matter with Putin during six phone calls that took place after February 27, when the intelligence was reportedly included in the president&rsquo;s daily written briefing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of this adds up,&rdquo; Rice said. &ldquo;We have a president who is doing our arch adversary&rsquo;s bidding, it would seem. And he is surrounded by sycophants and weaklings who aren&rsquo;t doing their jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rice said the president&rsquo;s advisers don&rsquo;t have the confidence to &ldquo;bring the president the tough messages he needs to hear.&rdquo;

Then Rice called and explained, in a patient and genial way, how frustrating this “urban legend” has been for her. She recounted her thinking, assured me that colleagues from the Brookings Institution, where she worked at the time, would back her up, and said, with a laugh, “I’ll swear on a stack of Bibles!” Unsure what to think, and with the deadline for the Tribune’s print edition looming, I deleted the reference.

<h3 id="steve-chapman-no-susan-rice-did-not-support-the-iraq-war">&ldquo;Steve Chapman: No, Susan Rice did not support the Iraq War&rdquo;</h3>

If Joe Biden takes my advice and chooses Susan Rice to be his running mate, then there will be criticism from people who opposed the Iraq War. That’s because if you Google &ldquo;Susan Rice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Iraq War,&rdquo; you will find several sources, including Wikipedia, that say she supported it. Let me try to save critics and journalists from that error by setting the record straight.</p>
<p>From everything I’ve been able to find, Rice did not support the Iraq War. She opposed it, in a show of wise and independent judgment.</p>
<p>I came by this information by falling victim to these sources and including a line in a recent column saying she endorsed the invasion. Shortly after it appeared online, I got a nice email from her press spokesperson, Erin Pelton, thanking me for the column but informing me that Rice opposed the war.</p>
<p>This came as a surprise. I asked for documentation but wasn’t convinced by the information she sent. I talked with Pelton by phone; she said she would see what else she could find.</p>
<p>Then, Rice called and explained, in a gracious and congenial way, how frustrating this &ldquo;urban legend&rdquo; has been for her. She recounted her thinking, assured me that colleagues from the Brookings Institution, where she worked at the time, would back her up, and said, with a laugh, &ldquo;I’ll swear on a stack of Bibles!&rdquo; Unsure what to think, and with the deadline for the Tribune’s print edition looming, I deleted the reference.</p>
<p>Later, I contacted Michael O’Hanlon and Ivo Daalder, fellow foreign policy scholars who were at Brookings with Rice at the time. O&rsquo;Hanlon told me, &ldquo;Susan was consistently against it from 2002.&rdquo; Daalder concurred: &ldquo;Susan was definitely against the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their memories confirm what Rice wrote in her memoir, &ldquo;Tough Love&rdquo;: &ldquo;From the start, I viewed that war of choice as a dangerous diversion from the main objective of defeating al-Qaida globally and in Afghanistan.&rdquo; She served as an adviser to Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign &ldquo;because he was the only leading Democratic candidate to oppose the Iraq War.&rdquo; She signed up with Barack Obama in 2008 because he also opposed it.</p>
<p>But she got falsely tagged as a supporter of the war, and the stain has refused to come out, mainly because of two statements that have been misinterpreted.</p>
<p>In a December 2002 interview on NPR, she said: &ldquo;It’s clear that Iraq poses a major threat. It’s clear that its weapons of mass destruction need to be dealt with forcefully, and that’s the path we’re on. I think the question becomes whether we can keep the diplomatic balls in the air and not drop any, even as we move forward, as we must, on the military side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But O’Hanlon notes: &ldquo;The military options she alludes to are not specified. For the Clinton administration, they were typically airstrikes or cruise missile strikes of limited duration and effect, not invasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rice also endorsed the idea of &ldquo;regime change.&rdquo; But there is less there than meets the eye. Bill Clinton signed a bill making it U.S. policy to &ldquo;support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.&rdquo; But he didn’t think the cause called for a U.S. invasion. The point was to encourage Iraqis to do the job.</p>
<p>In that December interview, Rice also said: &ldquo;The administration frankly owes the American public a much fuller and more honest assessment of what the costs will be of the actual conflict, as well as the aftermath, the post-conflict reconstruction. And the costs are going to be huge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rice didn’t oppose the invasion as boldly and unequivocally as some did. Peter Beinart of The Daily Beast said he listened to interviews she did before the war and concluded, &ldquo;I still can’t tell whether Susan Rice supported the war or opposed it.&rdquo; But being cautious and circumspect is not the same thing as supporting the war.</p>
<p>Why does all this matter? First, because the Iraq War was the biggest foreign policy catastrophe since Vietnam, and one most experts endorsed. Second, because Rice had to know her views carried a real risk. Most Democratic senators voted for the war resolution — including Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. Had the outcome been a glorious triumph, her opposition might have doomed her from serving in another administration.</p>
<p>A lot of smart, knowledgeable people made the mistake of endorsing the Iraq War. Susan Rice deserves credit for not being one of them.</p>
