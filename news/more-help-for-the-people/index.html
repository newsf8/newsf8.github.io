KUALA TERENGGANU: Tereng-ganu government announced an additional allocation of RM960,000 under the phase three stimulus package to help ease the burden of the people due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar said the additional allocation for the purchase of foodstuff would be distributed to affected people throughout the 32 state constituencies.</p>
<p>“An allocation of RM30,000 will be channelled to each state constituency which will benefit 600 people in one area.</p>
<p>“The priority is to help families who have no fixed salary and do not get monthly aid from the Social Welfare Department (JKM) and the Terengganu Islamic Affairs and Malay Customs Council (MAIDAM), ” he said in a statement posted on his Facebook page.</p>
<p>This is an extension of phase one and two Terengganu stimulus packages which include financial allocation, deferment and payment exemption for various types of rent and loans under the state government.</p>
<p>Ahmad Samsuri said the Village Community Management Council (MPKK) would identify the eligible recipients and the community service centre in each state constituency would handle the distribution of aid.</p>
<p>“The state government will coordinate the relief package to the people through several phases which will be announced from time to time.</p>
<p>“Let us pray that our country will recover from this pandemic and life will get back to normal soon, ” he said. — Bernama

<h3 id="people-are-decorating-their-windows-with-hearts-and-messages-of-hope-right-now">People are decorating their windows with hearts and messages of hope right now</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200325154636-01-hearts-windows-jenna-webb-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Thousands of people are practicing social distancing worldwide and under stay-at-home orders to stop the spread of coronavirus, but that&rsquo;s not stopping neighbors from leaving messages of hope in the windows of their homes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear where or when the effort started, but photos of people putting rainbows, colorful heart cutouts, teddy bears and anything that resembles a sign of hope have been spreading all over social media.</p>
<p>The motivation is simple and varies from neighborhood to neighborhood.</p>
<p>Some are participating because they want their neighbors who have been deemed &ldquo;essential workers&rdquo; to see some joy on their way out of their homes. Others say they decorated their windows so families taking walks and getting fresh air have a nice reminder that everyone is in this together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spread the love, not the germs&rsquo;</p>
<p>Natasha James is the founder of just one of the many growing Facebook groups dedicated to this effort, Hearts in the Window . She told CNN her original intent was to bring people together and make an online community giving families an activity to do while walking in their neighborhoods. She was sent a copy paste message about hearts in windows and after participating she decided to open it up to see what social media would do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Businesses have gotten involved, parents with children in the hospital, doctors, nurses and senior homes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>James said she wants people to be part of &ldquo;spreading the love, not the germs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James&rsquo; heart display filled the window at her home in Nanaimo, British Columbia.</p>
<p>Another Facebook group called A World of Hearts is sharing a similar sentiment. Its founder, Tree Hanafy, told CNN she, too, wanted to share what she was doing to get involved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s definitely helped bring some happiness to people who may be isolated at home all by themselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been wonderful to see all these people posting their photos and getting their families involved in it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regardless of how people are finding out about this initiative, they&rsquo;re posting and participating. Here&rsquo;s who they&rsquo;re doing it for:</p>
<p>For the neighborhood kids</p>
<p>In Norfolk, Virginia, Kyle Siebels told CNN he found out about the effort through his neighborhood Facebook page. When the Siebels family went for a walk Tuesday, Kyle said he saw 30 houses participating. Monday, Kyle&rsquo;s wife, Tory, cut out the hearts and went to town on their front door.</p>
<p>Nora Siebels stands outside her front door decked out in paper hearts in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our neighbors have started putting colored hearts in their windows for neighborhood kids to find on their walks while everyone is staying home,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook. &ldquo;We laced up our door so they wouldn&rsquo;t miss our circle. Pretty cool to see how many houses have participated. Nora (Kyle and Tory&rsquo;s daughter) definitely loves our walks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kelsey Goldstein told CNN she was able to rally some of her neighbors in Atlanta to participate in a weekly theme for their windows. Last week, it was shamrocks for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives the parents something to do with their kids,&rdquo; Goldstein said. &ldquo;It gets the kids excited about putting up their artwork for their friends to see and gives them something to do as they walk by. It really encouraged some sort of neighborhood collectiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This week, Goldstein said the neighborhood is displaying flowers, with rainbows and Easter eggs on deck for later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to get out so you can see other people from afar and it makes you feel less alone,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Shamrock decorations fill the windows of homes in Goldstein&rsquo;s Atlanta neighborhood.</p>
<p>For the essential workers</p>
<p>Jenna Webb told CNN her family&rsquo;s motivation for joining the movement was based on wanting to &ldquo;bring love and joy to essential workers in our neighborhood who still need to leave their homes and keep the world moving during this uncertain time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeing others post their photos of what they were doing using #AWorldOfHearts on social media, she wanted to bring that spirit to her neighborhood in Monroe, Michigan.</p>
<p>For inspiration and hope</p>
<p>In Haroey, an island on the west coast of Norway, Siw Harnes Sherman told CNN she found the Facebook movement through a friend in Canada and was inspired to share something people in Norway were doing. Instead of hearts, they are displaying rainbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a difficult time for everyone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This group makes people have some hope, and it takes focus away from all the problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight-year-olds Olivia and Kristoffer stand next to their rainbow drawings in Norway.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Reynolds in Victoria, British Columbia, told CNN this initiative started out as a craft. She&rsquo;s a single mother with a 2-year-old and high-risk parents.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Reynolds and her 2-year-old child filled the window of their home in British Columbia with colorful hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the lockdown, I am even more solo than I usually am as my mom helps, so this has been a real blow to my own mental health,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But when I saw other people making hearts on the window I wanted to not only spread some cheer for those in our neighborhood on walks but for my own sake. Seeing the color shine through the window has lifted my own spirits.&rdquo;

A shortage of ventilators will put lives at risk, so health authorities around the world are doing everything they can to get more</p>
<p>How ventilators work and why they are so important in saving people with coronavirus</p>
<p>Health authorities around the world are trying to find ways to fill their hospitals with more ventilators to cope with increasing numbers of coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>Car manufacturers are offering to help build more of the machines. In New York, city mayor Bill de Blasio says he needs 15,000.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of people who catch the Covid-19 disease experience only mild symptoms, about 6% need hospital care, with older patients at higher risk.</p>
<p>Australian authorities say they are confident they can avoid any shortage of ventilators.</p>
<p>Experts have told Guardian Australia that these efforts will be crucial, because a shortage of ventilators would put lives at risk.</p>
<p>Coronavirus vaccine: when will it be ready? Read more</p>
<p>“The reason this is a crisis is because without the ventilators, patients will die,” says Prof David Story, deputy director of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Integrated Critical Care, and a staff anaesthetist at Austin Hospital.</p>
<p>Prof Sarath Ranganathan, a board member of Lung Foundation Australia and director of respiratory and sleep medicine at Melbourne’s The Royal Children’s Hospital, said: “The experience in Italy and Spain, and the modelling used by mathematicians around the world, indicates the number of people who will become critically ill with Covid-19 will greatly exceed the capacity to care for them using respiratory support.</p>
<p>“Without access to ventilators many patients who might survive the infection will die.”</p>
<p>What is a ventilator and how does it work?</p>
<p>A mechanical ventilator is a machine that’s used to support patients with severe respiratory conditions that impact the lungs, including pneumonia.</p>
<p>Before a patient is placed on a ventilator, Day says medical staff – often anaesthetists – will perform a procedure called intubation.</p>
<p>After a patient is sedated and given a muscle relaxant, a tube is placed through the mouth and into the windpipe.</p>
<p>Day says the procedure is routine but, with Covid-19 patients, medical staff need to take extreme precautions to make sure they do not become infected with the virus.</p>
<p>“We have people almost in full hazmat suits,” he says.</p>
<p>The breathing tube is then attached to the ventilator and medical staff can adjust the rate that it pushes the air and oxygen into the lungs, and adjust the oxygen mix.</p>
<p>When would a patient go onto a ventilator?</p>
<p>Before deciding to put a patient onto a ventilator, Story says doctors are looking for signs of “respiratory failure”.</p>
<p>“The breathing rate will increase, they’ll look distressed, the CO2 in the blood goes up and they can become sedated and confused,” he says.</p>
<p>He says while a normal breathing rate is about 15 breaths a minute, if the rate gets to about 28 times a minute, then this is a signal that ventilation may be needed.</p>
<p>Before going on a mechanical ventilator, Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician, says there may be other attempts to increase a patient’s oxygen levels.</p>
<p>These “non-invasive” methods of ventilation can include masks and oxygen tanks.</p>
<p>Story says that with Covid-19, medical staff were looking to avoid non-invasive methods because patients would still cough and splutter, increasing the risk of the virus being transferred to medical staff.</p>
<p>How soon might a patient need a ventilator and for how long?</p>
<p>Ranganathan says once a doctor sees that a patient needs a ventilator, “it is required quickly”.</p>
<p>He says: “The patient can be sustained for short periods of time using manual forms of ventilation such as using a bag and mask system with oxygen, but usually being attached to a ventilator needs to happen within 30 minutes if critical.”</p>
<p>Story says that in severe Covid-19 patients, a life-threatening condition can develop called acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards) that requires ventilators to deliver smaller volumes of oxygen and air, but at higher rates.</p>
<p>This could mean a patient may need to be on a ventilator “for weeks”.</p>
<p>To avoid complications from the breathing tube going down the throat, Story says a tracheostomy is carried out so the tube can go straight into the windpipe through the neck.</p>
<p>“Patients can be more awake with tracheostomy and the hole just heals itself,” says Story.</p>
<p>“If patients develop Ards they will be in an intensive care unit for weeks and they’ll die without ventilators.”</p>
<p>Why a shortage of ventilators matters, and what’s being done to avoid it.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious ways to avoid a shortage of ventilators, is to reduce the numbers of people catching the disease in the first place. That means following all the health advice, including social distancing and hygiene rules.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society and the industry minister, Karen Andrews, have all expressed confidence that a shortage can be avoided.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s coronavirus self-isolation rules: who has to do it and how it works Read more</p>
<p>The Australian government is also investigating whether ventilators used on animals in veterinary clinics could be converted. Sleep apnoea machines and anaesthetic machines are also options.</p>
<p>Story says ventilators used in ambulances could be used as back up.</p>
<p>All of that work will be crucial in saving lives if the social distancing measures and community lockdowns don’t stem the flow of patients into critical care.</p>
<p>Wilson said: “Health care workers responsible for managing severe life-threatening cases like Covid-19 are extremely concerned regarding their ability to use appropriate support for large numbers of patients expected to suffer respiratory failure.</p>
<p>“In essence, this means that many will not be able to be treated with mechanical ventilation and difficult decisions will have to be made by staff, families and patients about the limits of support. There are many ethical dilemmas in this, and none can be easily resolved.”
