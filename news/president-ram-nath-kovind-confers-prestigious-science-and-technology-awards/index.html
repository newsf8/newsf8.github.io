<h3 id="hyderabad-award-for-ccmb-scientist">&ldquo;Hyderabad: Award for CCMB scientist&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Amitabha-Chattopadhyay.jpg" alt="img">
By | Published: 7:47 pm</p>
<p>Hyderabad: Amitabha Chattopadhyay, senior scientist and SERB (Science and Engineering Research Board) Distinguished Fellow, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), has been conferred with G N Ramachandran Gold Medal for his work in biological sciences and technology.</p>
<p>The award recognises scientists with outstanding contribution in progressing human knowledge in their field of specialisation based on their work done in India. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been bestowing this award since 2004 in memory of Dr G N Ramachandran, founding father of structural biology in India.</p>
<p>Prof Chattopadhyay’s interest lies in understanding the functioning of cell membrane and receptors housed on the membranes. A special focus of his work is the role of cholesterol on function and dynamics of these receptors with implications in various diseases. Most of these studies in the lab have revolved around elucidating the biology of serotonin 1A receptors, a target of choice for many anti-depressant drugs.

President of India Ram Nath Kovind and Minister for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences Dr. Harsh Vardhan on Thursday presented the Technology Awards and other prizes for excellence in science and technology, instituted by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).</p>
<p>The winners of the CSIR Technology Awards are - Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow; Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute, Bhavnagar; Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Dhanbad; and National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru. The awards were instituted in 1990 to foster and encourage multi-disciplinary in-house team efforts and external interaction for technology development, transfer and commercialization.</p>
<p>Prof. Amitabha Chattopadhyay of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, bagged the G.N.Ramachandran Gold Medal for excellence in biological sciences and technology; Cadila Healthcare Limited and Carborundum Universal Limited got the CSIR Diamond Jubilee Technology Award.</p>
<p>Nine young scientists were presented CSIR Young Scientist Award: Dr Bidyut Purkait of Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow; Dr Lipi Thukral of Institute of Genomics &amp; Integrative Biology, New Delhi; Dr John Mondal of Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad; Dr Sasidhar B.S. of National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram; Dr Amol Prakash of National Institute of Oceanography, Goa; Dr Bodhisatwa Hazra of Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Dhanbad; Dr Divya Agrawal of Central Scientific Instruments Organisation, Chandigarh; Dr Prabhat Ranjan Prem of Structural Engineering Research Centre, Chennai; and Dr. Shikha of Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Durgapur.</p>
<p>In addition, 17 school children were awarded the CSIR Innovation Award for School Children.</p>
<p>The first prize went to Anmol Rathi and Harsh Agrawal, students of R.K. Sarda Vidya Mandir, Raipur for their innovation on “novel technique for early detection of pancreatic cancer through spermine level in human saliva”.</p>
<p>The President also unveiled the first Indigenous High Temperature Fuel Cell System developed by CSIR in partnership with two Indian companies, Reliance Industries Limited and Thermax Ltd, Pune under its flagship program named “New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative.</p>
<p>The 5 kW system generates power in an environmental-friendly manner using methanol/bio-methane and produces heat and water as bi-products for further use. The cells have been developed based on high temperature proton exchange membrane (HTPEM) technology. They are most suitable for distributed stationary power applications such as for small offices, commercial units and data centres, where highly reliable power is essential with simultaneous requirement for air-conditioning.</p>
<p>This system can also help meet the requirement of efficient, clean and reliable backup power generator for telecom towers, and strategic applications in remote areas. It would replace diesel generating sets and help reduce India’s dependence on crude oil.</p>
<p>Three CSIR laboratories were involved in the development : National Chemical Laboratory, Pune; National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi and Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Karaikudi.</p>
<p>The President lauded the accomplishments of CSIR and its technological interventions towards the socio-economic development of the nation. He congratulated all the awardees and urged them to address the challenges facing the country.</p>
<p>Dr Harsh Vardhan expressed pride in CSIR contributions and said that the country has high expectations from CSIR in developing solutions and technologies towards sustainable development in the country. He released a book on on the winners of CSIR’s Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Awards from 1958 to 2018.</p>

<p>Updated: Nov 03, 2017 15:43 IST</p>
<p>The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune is gearing up to be one of the 20 institutions of eminence, with world-class educational facilities and greater institutional autonomy, said erstwhile director professor KN Ganesh. He expressed this to be one of the major goals for the institution while declaring the handing over of his position to the new director of IISER Pune, professor Jayant B Udgaonkar.</p>
<p>Professor Ganesh has led IISER to its current glory, since its inception in 2006, and will be taking over as the director of the sixth IISER at Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how, but I have been given the unique opportunity to be the founding director of two IISERs. Seeing such an institute grow has been an honour and we want it to soon be listed among the 20 institutions of eminence,” said professor Ganesh.</p>
<p>The competition, which is open to all the institutes in the country, has been proposed by the government with an aim to catapult the Indian academic scenario to global recognition. Becoming one of the winners in this would mean freedom from the University Grants Commission’s restrictive regulations and more institutional autonomy. According to professor Ganesh, IISERs in Pune, Mohali and Kolkata have been selected to compete in this based on their rankings.</p>
<p>The new director, professor Udgaonkar, who took office from November 1, cited the strife, to take IISER, Pune to the level of an institution of eminence, to be one of his major current goals. “For now, I have just entered into a space that I need to know more about. As a scientist, I believe it is very important to interact with students, especially undergraduate students, and inspire them. I am here to do that and to help IISER grow, which the institution has already been doing at a fast pace. And, as this competition guarantees a certain level of funding, recognition and autonomy, we are definitely looking to put our best into it,” he said.</p>
<p>His future plans also entail strengthening the character of IISER through more interdisciplinary research. “The truth is that modern science is increasingly interdisciplinary. IISER, Pune should become the platform for students to constantly learn and unlearn science through different interdisciplinary avenues.”</p>
<p>Professor Udgaonkar is a biophysicist with over 30 years of research experience. Prior to his arrival at IISER, PUNE, he was a part of the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru. He has led a research group working on protein folding, while serving as the dean of faculty at NCBS. Further, the scientist has also received notable accolades including the BM Birla Award in Biology and GN Ramachandran Gold Medal by CSIR.</p>
<p>They Say</p>
<p>“If you see the number of scientists per population, its the least in India. To develop into a strong nation, that needs to change” - Prof K N Ganesh.</p>
<p>“If we are using taxpayer’s money we are answerable to the society through our work. But the society also needs to realise the importance of scientific research and its implications in nation building” - Prof Jayant B. Udgaonkar
