<p>Media playback is not supported on this device De Gea mistakes send Chelsea to FA Cup final</p>
<p>Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea endured a Wembley nightmare as Chelsea strolled to victory and set up an FA Cup final date with Arsenal.</p>
<p>United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ditched his usual FA Cup keeper Sergio Romero to keep faith with De Gea - but the experienced Spain international produced two horrendous errors either side of half-time to gift Chelsea two goals.</p>
<p>De Gea made a flimsy attempt to deal with Olivier Giroud&rsquo;s flick in first-half stoppage time then weakly fumbled Mason Mount&rsquo;s tame 20-yard shot into the net moments after the restart.</p>
<p>Chelsea&rsquo;s excellent performance fully merited this victory and United&rsquo;s abject misery after a dreadful performance was complete when captain Harry Maguire diverted Marcos Alonso&rsquo;s cross into his own net at the near post with 16 minutes left.</p>
<p>Frank Lampard&rsquo;s side were in complete control from first to last as they comprehensively ended Manchester United&rsquo;s 19-match unbeaten run in all competitions.</p>
<p>Bruno Fernandes pulled a goal back from the penalty spot late on after Callum Hudson-Odoi fouled Anthony Martial but it could not even be described as a consolation as Chelsea closed out the win.</p>
<p>Lampard eyes first-season silverware</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device &lsquo;Absolute howler&rsquo; from De Gea gifts Chelsea second goal</p>
<p>Lampard is now in position to make his first season in charge a highly satisfactory one as they contemplate a place in the FA Cup final and lie third in the Premier League, in position to reach next season&rsquo;s Champions League.</p>
<p>And no-one can question their right to this win as they dominated from start to finish, particularly in midfield, where they were able to subdue the influence of the talented Fernandes.</p>
<p>Once again 33-year-old Giroud demonstrated his influence, leading the line selflessly and being rewarded with that crucial first goal, even though it received a large helping hand from De Gea.</p>
<p>Chelsea were more energetic, dangerous and aggressive and while they were thankful to those mistakes from De Gea, the margin of victory was no more than they deserved.</p>
<p>Lampard&rsquo;s side cut off any supply line to United&rsquo;s forwards and it will be an intriguing final on 1 August back here at Wembley, when he pits his wits against another rookie manager in Arsenal&rsquo;s Mikel Arteta.</p>
<p>Manchester United&rsquo;s day of misery</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Watch: Giroud&rsquo;s &lsquo;deft&rsquo; finish gives Chelsea FA Cup lead</p>
<p>United went into this semi-final high on optimism on that long unbeaten run and with the sense that Solskjaer was starting to get to grips with the big rebuilding job.</p>
<p>That continues and United are still in decent shape to reach next season&rsquo;s Champions League, either via the Premier League or Europa League, but this was a savage setback.</p>
<p>And the main culprit was De Gea, who gives the impression of a goalkeeper either in permanent decline or going through a very long slump.</p>
<p>De Gea changed the face of this FA Cup semi-final with those mistakes, allowing Chelsea to transform their dominance into a two-goal lead.</p>
<p>Fernandes was overpowered in midfield and United had no punch in attack, where Solskjaer decided to leave the potency of Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood on the bench, along with Paul Pogba.</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Harry Maguire own goal gives Chelsea 3-0 FA Cup lead over Man Utd</p>
<p>It was perhaps a sign that Solskjaer knew all was not well when he introduced Martial for defender Eric Bailly when he sustained a first-half head injury while Greenwood and Pogba were only introduced in desperation when the game was gone.</p>
<p>Bailly suffered a cut to the back of his head and Solskjaer said the Ivorian had been taken to hospital for &ldquo;routine checks and protocols&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In defence they were also vulnerable, Victor Lindelof losing Giroud too easily for Chelsea&rsquo;s opener and captain Maguire ending any hopes with that own goal.</p>
<p>United complained they should have had a penalty when Martial went down under Kurt Zouma&rsquo;s first-half challenge but this was a miserable experience for Solskjaer and his players.</p>
<p>Solskjaer&rsquo;s side have had many good days in recent months. This was a very bad one.</p>
<p>Man of the match - Olivier Giroud</p>
<p>Since his debut in the FA Cup in January 2013, Chelsea&rsquo;s Olivier Giroud has scored 16 goals in the competition - only Sergio Aguero (19) has netted more in this period.</p>
<p>Match stats - Chelsea knock United out for sixth time</p>
<p>Chelsea have reached their 14th FA Cup final. Only Arsenal (21 including this season) and Manchester United (20) have made the final on more occasions.</p>
<p>Manchester United have been eliminated from the FA Cup by Chelsea for a sixth time (including three of the last four seasons) - only Arsenal (seven) have knocked the Red Devils out of the competition on more occasions.</p>
<p>This was Chelsea&rsquo;s first victory against Manchester United since the 2018 FA Cup final - the Blues were winless in six matches across all competitions against the Red Devils prior to today (D2 L4).</p>
<p>Chelsea are the first side to beat Manchester United since Burnley in the Premier League back in January, ending United&rsquo;s 19 game unbeaten run in all competitions.</p>
<p>Mason Mount became the first Englishman to score for Chelsea at Wembley since John Terry in the 2015 League Cup final versus Tottenham.</p>
<p>No player has scored more goals for Frank Lampard in his managerial career than Mason Mount (18 - level with Harry Wilson).</p>
<p>Since his Manchester United debut in February, no Premier League player has been involved in more goals across all competitions than Bruno Fernandes (17 - nine goals and eight assists).</p>
<p>Manchester United have both taken (19) and scored (15) more penalties than any other Premier League side this season in all competitions.

Goals for the Blues either side of half-time from Olivier Giroud and Mason Mount did the damage, before a Harry Maguire own goal sealed it for Frank Lampard’s men. The Reds, who lost Eric Bailly to a nasty head injury just before half-time, grabbed a consolation from the penalty spot through Bruno Fernandes on 85 minutes, but it was too little, too late on the day.</p>
<p>Ole made five changes to the XI which had picked up a crucial three points in the race for a top-four spot, at Crystal Palace on Thursday night. Incidentally, the Reds were further boosted in those stakes before kick-off with the news that, across London, fellow chasers Leicester City had been defeated 3-0 by Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur. For the Reds, in came Eric Bailly, Brandon Williams, Daniel James, Fred and Nemanja Matic for Tim Fosu-Mensah, Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial, who were all named on the bench.</p>
<p>After some early possession for the Reds in the opening 10 minutes, it was Chelsea who created the better opportunities thereafter. David De Gea made an excellent punch clear from Reece James’ well-hit 25-yarder on 10 minutes, before some good pressure from Aaron Wan-Bissaka forced Marcos Alonso to head over five minutes later.

Chelsea – Manchester United: Chelsea is going to the FA Cup Final for the third time in four seasons after dispatching Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.</p>
<p>Olivier Giroud and Mason Mount got goals off of David De Gea howlers as Frank Lampard moved within a win of his first trophy as Chelsea manager.</p>
<p>A Harry Maguire own goal made it 3-0 before Bruno Fernandes converted a penalty to give the Red Devils a marker.</p>
<p>[ MORE: Premier League summer schedule ]</p>
<p>Chelsea will meet London rivals Arsenal at Wembley for the FA Cup Final on Aug. 1, as it was London 2-0 Manchester in the semifinals.</p>
<p>The Blues and Gunners have combined to appear in 33 FA Cup Finals with 21 wins between the two (Arsenal’s 13 are the most in FA Cup history). Arsenal beat Chelsea in the 2002 and 2017 FA Cup Finals.</p>
<p>Three things we learned</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bailly suffers scary head injury: Ivorian center back Eric Bailly has had his fair share of injuries at Old Trafford, but the one that felled him Sunday was scary for other reasons. Bailly went head-to-head with teammate Harry Maguire and both needed medical attention. While Maguire deemed fit to return with a bandage, a bleeding Bailly was able to walk off the pitch but then laid back on the turf outside the touch line for more care. Bailly was then given oxygen and put in a neck brace before being wheeled off the field on a stretcher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paging Mr. Henderson: David De Gea developed from his early mediocre days at United to become one of the best goalkeepers in the world but he’s made a series of miserable errors this year. His inability to stop Giroud’s opener can be explained away by an ardent DDG supporter but his error on Mount’s long-range shot was putrid. He did well to deny Giroud with a slap in the 59th, but the damage was done. Cries for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to give current Sheffield United loan man Dean Henderson a chance to claim the starter’s spot next season will only grow after De Gea’s Sunday at Wembley.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lampard out-wits Solskjaer: Both managers knew they entered the day two wins from silverware but also in control of their Champions League destinies through the Premier League route. Both teams have Wednesday matches, so there was going to be some rotation. Chelsea didn’t have N’Golo Kante and couldn’t start Christian Pulisic due to a minor injury (though the American was shown warming up during the match).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lampard went for it, arguably starting his best available XI. Solskjaer switched things up and used Daniel James up top despite the youngster having just one goal, against LASK, in 2020. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were on the bench,</p>
<p>Yes, Ole’s in this match for the duration if De Gea’s anywhere near his usual self. Maybe that should weigh a bit more on our analysis but United looked like a team with little concern for hardware.</p>
<p>Man of the Match</p>
<p>Mount — You’ve gotta shoot to score and Mount was willing to do that. He hasn’t had a strong second half of the season compared to his start to the campaign at Chelsea, but Mount was dangerous on the dribble and could’ve scored two. He also made a terrific steal to set up his drive past De Gea. Honorable mention: Cesar Azpilicueta, who has been the Blues rock for weeks (and probably much longer).</p>
<p>Manchester United – Chelsea recap</p>
<p>The first half was relatively sleepy for 30 minutes aside from an adventurous Reece James shot that troubled David De Gea.</p>
<p>It began to open up when a Marcus Rashford-won free kick added some excitement. Wily Caballero had to poke Bruno Fernandes’ arrow over the bar.</p>
<p>At the other end, Mason Mount rolled a tepid 20-yard effort to David De Gea.</p>
<p>United had already seen Eric Bailly suffer an injury and attempt to stay on when Harry Maguire clashed heads with the Ivorian center back. Bailly was removed from the game and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer chose offense in deploying Anthony Martial in his place.</p>
<p>Chelsea scored deep in stoppage but De Gea and Victor Lindelof will both be upset that Giroud’s outside-of-the-boot flick of a Cesar Azpilicueta cross battled its way off the prone keeper’s body and over the line.</p>
<p>[ MORE: Premier League stats ]</p>
<p>Mount made it 2-0 very early in the second half Mount picked off a miserable pass to the center of the pitch and hit a low shot that De Gea absolutely bungled.</p>
<p>De Gea made the save on Giroud’s deflected shot before the hour mark to keep it 2-0.</p>
<p>Maguire then poked a Marcos Alonso cross to Antonio Rudiger off De Gea to complete the scoring with 16 minutes to play.</p>
<p>Callum Hudson-Odoi cut down Anthony Martial in the box late to set up Fernandes’ finish.

Nemanja Matic has revealed Manchester United&rsquo;s players discussed the importance of shifting their focus to Wednesday&rsquo;s game against West Ham after their FA Cup humbling at the hands of Chelsea.</p>
<p>United were outperformed in London as Chelsea secured a 3-1 victory, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&rsquo;s changes and tactical tweaks backfiring against Frank Lampard&rsquo;s side. Olivier Giroud, Mason Mount and a Harry Maguire own goal did the damage, before a late Bruno Fernandes consolation from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>It leaves United with only a top four finish and the Europa League to play for this season and they face West Ham in a vital league game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Matic spoke to MUTV after the defeat and revealed United&rsquo;s players spoke about the need to quickly move on and focus on the crucial Premier League game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are disappointed of course because we lost,&rdquo; said the Serbian midfielder. &ldquo;We wanted that final but Chelsea scored three goals, they used their chances and deserve to be in the final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our focus is on Wednesday against West Ham, so we have to win that game to be in the Champions League. From this moment we will focus on that and we spoke a bit in the changing room about that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In three days we have another challenge and we have to recover as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matic admitted that United must improve from their poor showing against Chelsea and hopes the top four race will precipitate a reaction in the next game.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Every three days we play, so we have to analyse this game for sure. But all our focus needs to be on West Ham on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our target is to be top four and we&rsquo;ll do our best. We always want to win but this is football. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t play well and this can happen, but in the future we cannot allow to concede three goals and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll learn from this.&rdquo;

<p>Chelsea will face Arsenal in an all-London FA Cup final next month at Wembley Stadium, and the Blues largely have Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea to thank for Sunday’s 3-1 win.</p>
<p>Frank Lampard’s side got goals from Olivier Giroud and Mason Mount on either side of halftime before United defender Harry Maguire capped off his side’s nightmare day with an own goal with just over a quarter hour remaining. Bruno Fernandes did pull one back on from the penalty spot with five minutes to go, but it was too little, too late by then.</p>
<p>De Gea could and should have done better on the Blues’ first two tallies — especially Mount’s back-breaking second goal. It was a speculative shot that should have been routinely saved but somehow eluded the grasp of the Spanish backstop, whose amateurish mistakes have cost the Red Devils dearly on several occasions in recent seasons.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: Man United’ defeat wasn’t all on de Gea. Chelsea, which unlike United fielded a less-than -full-strength lineup as they chase Champions League qualification with just two Premier League games remaining, was the sharper, hungrier team by far from start to finish.</p>
<p>Even without white-hot American talisman Christian Pulisic leading the attack, the Blues outshot, out-chanced and out-possessed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side, which switched to a three-man backline for the match. The tactical tweak didn’t work; United would’ve been lucky to get into the dressing room at the half on even terms, but Chelsea deservedly went ahead just before the intermission at Wembley.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Giroud’s opener came after a lengthy delay to attend to Manchester United defender Eric Bailly, who left the field on a stretcher with a suspected concussion after a scary clash of heads with teammate Maguire. The goal arrived in the 11th minute of first half stoppage time, with the veteran French striker stabbing a seeing-eye cross from Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta past de Gea:</p>

<p>United defender Victor Lindelof didn’t do de Gea any favors on the play, allowing the 33-year-old Giroud to get goal-side of him as Willian released an open Azpilicueta on the wing. But de Gea still wasn’t able to paw away Giroud’s redirect, which hit him on the right hand before spinning across the line.</p>
<p>If the match wasn’t over after the first two goals, it surely was when Maguire turned the ball into his own net. This time at least, there was nothing de Gea could do:</p>

<p>Chelsea will meet the crosstown rival Gunners on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Meantime, Man United closes out its 2019-20 slate with Premier League matches against West Ham and fourth-place Leicester City, which did both the third-pace Blues and the fifth-place Red Devils a huge favor by losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Prem earlier Sunday. The top four finishers in England receive a Champions League berth.</p>
<p>Lampard’s side faces champions Liverpool and Wolverhampton in its final two league games. It will also meet German titan Bayern Munich Aug. 8 in the second leg of its round of 16 Champions League series.</p>
