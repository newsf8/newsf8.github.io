<p>Popular Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead inside his Mumbai home on Sunday, with local media, quoting police, saying the 34-year-old actor committed suicide.</p>
<p>Initial reports citing police said the actor, who starred in films such as Kai Po Che, PK and MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra. Mumbai police spokesperson Pranaya Ashok confirmed the death and said details were being investigated.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>Rajput, who started as a TV actor, made his Bollywood debut in 2013 with director Abhishek Kapoor in Kai Po Che (I have cut), based on a novel by Chetan Bhagat.</p>
<p>Social media was flooded with condolences for the actor, with many reacting to the news with disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sushant Singh Rajput &hellip; a bright young actor gone too soon,&rdquo; Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. &ldquo;He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bollywood star Akshay Kumar wrote on Twitter, &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this at all &hellip; it&rsquo;s shocking &hellip; a beautiful actor and a good friend &hellip; it&rsquo;s disheartening,&rdquo; actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui tweeted.</p>
<p>Rajput played former Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the 2016 film MS Dhoni: The Untold Story. Among his other movies are Kedarnath, Sonchiriya (Golden Bird) and Raabta (Connection).</p>
<p>He was last seen in the 2019 Netflix film, Drive.</p>
<p>So much to say. But to sum it up you inspired so many of us brother. You paved the path. But why would you do this. Shocked and no I cannot believe. Rest in peace wherever you are. #SushantSingh üôèüôè ‚Äî GURMEET CHOUDHARY (@gurruchoudhary) June 14, 2020</p>

<p>Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I‚Äôd enjoyed the film and wish I‚Äôd been a part of it.

<p>Earlier, Manoj Sharma, Additional Commissioner of Police, Western Region, told local PTI news agency that the actor &ldquo;committed suicide at his residence in Bandra&rdquo;. No suicide note was found, media reports said.</p>
<p>Mumbai, India&rsquo;s financial hub and home to Bollywood, has been grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the business of entertainment to a complete halt in the country.</p>
<p>Rajput hailed from Patna, Bihar, and had enrolled at a New Delhi University to study engineering, before dropping out to pursue a career in acting, according to local media outlet NDTV.

Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>
