<p>A white couple face criminal charges after one of them was captured on video pulling a handgun on a Black woman and her daughters in a restaurant parking lot in Michigan.</p>
<p>Jillian Wuestenberg, 32, and Eric Wuestenberg, 42, were arrested after Wednesday night’s confrontation and charged Thursday with felonious assault, Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper said in a release. They were later arraigned and are free on a $50,000 personal bond, according to the Oakland County sheriff’s office. As a condition of the bond they must turn over all firearms, not engage in “assaultive behavior” and not leave Michigan, Sheriff Michael Bouchard said in a statement.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether they have attorneys yet who could comment on the allegations. The Wuestenbergs are next scheduled to appear in court for a probable cause hearing on July 14, the sheriff’s office said in a release.</p>
<p>Cellphone video captured the confrontation outside a Chipotle in Orion Township, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.</p>
<p>Jillian Wuestenberg can be seen outside her vehicle shouting, “Get the (expletive) away! Get away!” while pointing a handgun. She eventually gets back in her vehicle, which her husband drives away.</p>
<p>Bouchard told reporters that the couple are from Independence Township and both have concealed pistol licenses. Deputies seized two handguns from the couple after they were detained.</p>
<p>The Detroit News first reported on the three-minute video posted online that shows part of the interaction. Takelia Hill, who is Black, told the newspaper that it happened after the white woman bumped into Hill’s teenage daughter as they were entering the fast food restaurant.</p>
<p>The video footage starts after that, in the parking lot. A woman since identified as Jillian Wuestenberg is heard arguing with Hill and her daughters. Wuestenberg climbs into the vehicle, rolls down the window and says, “White people aren’t racist,” and, “I care about you,” before the vehicle she was in starts to back away.</p>
<p>Her husband, who had led his wife to the vehicle, turns to the camera and asks, “Who &hellip; do you think you guys are?” using an expletive.</p>
<p>Then, as someone is behind the vehicle, Jillian Wuestenberg jumps out and points a handgun in the direction of a person who’s recording. She screams at people to get away from her and her vehicle. A woman shouts, “She’s got a gun on me!” and urges someone in the parking lot to call the police.</p>
<p>Wuestenberg then lowers the gun, climbs into the passenger seat and the vehicle drives off.</p>
<p>Cooper, the prosecutor, told The Associated Press that her office viewed the available video before filing charges.</p>
<p>“It is an unfortunate set of circumstances that tempers run high over, basically, not much of an incident,” she said of what led to the confrontation.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of tension in our society, a lot of tension among folks and people with each other,” Bouchard, the sheriff, said “I would just say this, we are asking and expect our police — and rightfully so — to deescalate every situation they possibly can, and we should be doing that. But I would say that needs to happen with us individually in our own lives and situations, that we interact with each other and deescalate those moments.”</p>
<p>After the video surfaced, Eric Wuestenberg was fired from his job at Oakland University near Detroit, a spokesman said. He worked as a veterans support services coordinator, according to a university website.</p>
<p>“We have seen the video and we deem his behavior unacceptable,” the university said in an emailed statement. “The employee has been notified that his employment has been terminated by the university.”</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin said in a statement that Eric Wuestenberg also had participated in one of her voluntary advisory boards, on veterans’ issues. She said the conduct she saw in the video “is beyond the pale of acceptable behavior” and that she removed him from the advisory board Thursday.

ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich. – The Oakland County Sheriff announced charges relating to an incident Wednesday where a woman pulled a gun in an Orion Township parking lot.</p>
<p>The incident went viral on social media. Video from the scene show the barrel of the gun pointed directly at the camera.</p>
<p>The woman and the driver with her have been charged with felonious assault.</p>
<p>It happened at about 6 p.m. in a quiet shopping area outside a Chipotle Mexican Grill on Baldwin Road.</p>
<p>Jillian Deanne Wuestenberg (L), Eric Peter Wuestenberg (R) (Oakland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office)</p>
<p>Jillian Wuestenberg, 32, from Independence Township, drew her weapon, chambered a round and pointed it at a Black mother and her two teenage daughters.</p>
<p>The gunwoman’s husband, 42-year-old Eric Wuestenberg &ndash; who was also armed &ndash; called 911. Both Wuestenbergs are registered Concealed Pistol License holders.</p>
<p>The husband of the family facing the gun, a Detroit Police Officer, was driving to the scene and he called 911.</p>
<p>When Oakland County deputies arrived, the Jillian Wuestenberg was detailed but let go. During the investigation, both firearms were held as evidence.</p>
<p>Both Wuestenbergs have been charged with felonious assault Thursday.</p>
<p>Another video from the scene shows the mother and daughters become frustrated at the Wuestenbergs and accuse them of bumping into one of the teenagers. The situation escalated. A thump from the back of the van can be heard in the video as the couple tries to back out. That’s when the woman exited the vehicle and pulls out her handgun.</p>
<p>According to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office, the couple claimed to fear for their lives after their vehicle was struck with a hand by the other party.</p>
<p>Police said it was unclear who the aggressor was and further investigation is needed.</p>
<p>You can watch the video from YouTube below &ndash; warning: There is explicit language.

ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich. – The attorneys for both families involved in a viral confrontation are speaking out about what happened Wednesday.</p>
<p>While both sides can’t agree with what happened, they do agree that the way people are treating each other has gotten out of hand.</p>
<p>The gun drawn altercation between Jillian and Eric Wuestenberg; and Takelia Hill and her daughters went viral, leading to felony charges.</p>
<p>It’s also cost Eric Wuestenburg his Oakland University job and position on Rep. Elissa Slotkin’s advisory committee.</p>
<p>Both parties attorneys said their clients are overwhelmed and their lives have been utterly disrupted.</p>
<p>“She’s emotionally a wreck and her kids &ndash; she had a 5-year-old, a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old present. They saw this,” said Chris Quinn, the Hill family attorney.</p>
<p>“They’re devastated, you have two good people. My client Eric is a disabled vet. He served his country very well,” said Terry Johnson, the Wuestenberg family attorney.</p>
<p>The Wuestenbergs are out on bond and the controversy is expected to continue.</p>
<p>“I think the country as a whole is tired of seeing situations where you have unarmed Blacks having firearms pointed at them,” said Quinn.</p>
<p>“A guy like Eric has been taken down because someone uttered three words. ‘You’re a racist.&rsquo; How fair is that? Where is the due process in that?” asked Johnson.</p>
<p>Quinn believes Jillian Wuestenberg should have deescalated the argument with the 15-year-old girl and Johnson believes charges should be filed against Hill.

Here is the latest Michigan news from The Associated Press at 1:40 a.m. EDT</p>
<p>UNDATED (AP) — A white couple has been arrested after at least one handgun was pulled on a Black woman and her daughters during a videotaped confrontation in a restaurant parking lot in Michigan. Jillian Wuestenberg and Eric Wuestenberg were charged Thursday with felonious assault. Cellphone video captured the confrontation Wednesday outside a Chipotle in Orion Township, northwest of Detroit. Jillian Wuestenberg can be seen outside her vehicle shouting “Get away!” while pointing a handgun. She eventually gets back in her vehicle, which is driven away by her husband. Sheriff Michael Bouchard told reporters that the couple is from Independence Township and both have concealed pistol licenses.</p>
<p>BAY CITY, Mich. (AP) — Five people and a dog have been rescued from a sinking boat in Michigan’s Saginaw Bay. The Coast Guard says Thursday that the 50-foot vessel was halfway submerged and one person wearing a life jacket was in the water when its rescue boat arrived after 11 a.m. Wednesday. A line was tossed to the person who was pulled aboard the Coast Guard Station Saginaw River rescue boat. The other four people and the dog were helped aboard the rescue boat from the sinking vessel. They were taken to Bay Harbor Marina in Bay City. The Coast Guard said Thursday that salvage crews were working on a plan to remove the sinking boat from Saginaw Bay which is just off Lake Huron.</p>
<p>CHARLOTTE, Mich. (AP) — Health officials in Michigan are telling people who attended a weekend garage sale near the community of Charlotte that a person working at the sale has reported having symptoms of the coronavirus. The Barry-Eaton Health District also says that people who bought or handled items at the sale should monitor themselves for symptoms such as a fever, fatigue, and loss of a sense of smell or taste. The district also urges people to sanitize anything they may have bought with a disinfectant. The sale was at 1748 West Kalamo Highway.</p>
<p>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) — Three former Michigan youth center staff members charged in the death of a Black teenager who was restrained after throwing a sandwich have been arraigned. Michael Mosley and Heather McLogan turned themselves in Wednesday to authorities and appeared in Kalamazoo County District Court on involuntary manslaughter and child abuse charges. Zachary Solis was arraigned Tuesday after turning himself in. They were charged last week in the May 1 death of 16-year-old Cornelius Fredericks. Authorities have said Fredericks went into cardiac arrest April 29 while being restrained at Lakeside Academy in Kalamazoo. He was hospitalized but died two days later. A doctor who performed the autopsy, said Fredericks had been restrained on the ground, resulting in asphyxia.
