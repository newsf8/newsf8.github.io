THE UK coronavirus death toll hit 422 as a study claimed up to HALF the population may have caught the killer bug.</p>
<p>Deaths jumped by 87 in just 24 hours on Tuesday - the biggest daily increase yet - with the youngest victim killed by the virus aged just 33.</p>

<p>The number of cases across the UK climbed by 1,427 from 6,650 - hitting 8,077 in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust was one of the worst hit, recording 21 deaths in a day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a study by researchers at the University of Oxford claimed up to 50 per cent of the UK population may have already contracted the coronavirus.</p>
<p>It suggests the disease may have already been prevalent in the UK up to two months before the first case was officially diagnosed.</p>
<p>Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford, led the study and says the UK must now increase testing to discover the true stage of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need immediately to begin large-scale serological surveys - antibody testing - to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in now,’&rdquo; he told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>However, the research presents a very different view of the epidemic to the modelling at Imperial College London, which has strongly influenced government policy.</p>
<p>It comes at Health Secretary Matt Hancock today called for an army of 250,000 volunteers to join the coronavirus frontline.</p>
<p>LOCKDOWN</p>
<p>Mr Hancock also confirmed that a new hospital called the Nightingale Hospital with capacity for 4,000 people will open next week at the Excel Centre in east London after being set up with the help of the military.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr Hancock said that home is now the &ldquo;front line&rdquo; in the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>Authorities have also ordered 3.5million tests that will determine if a patient has already recovered from coronavirus and is able to return to work.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson last night ordered a mass lockdown - closing all non-essential shops, banning gatherings of more than two people and insisting families stay behind closed doors.</p>
<p>All travel on roads, trains and buses was also banned unless it’s essential to get to work.</p>
<p>Brits were also ordered not to meet up with friends and to go out to buy food or to exercise just once a day.</p>
<p>Anyone who flouts the new crackdown will face fines of up to £1,000 or even arrest when cops are given emergency powers.</p>
<p>The draconian measures which will change every aspect of Brits&rsquo; lives included:</p>
<p>In a special broadcast on all main TV channels , the PM branded coronavirus “the biggest threat this country has faced for decades”.</p>
<p>Online shopping and deliveries are continuing despite the lockdown of non-essential UK shops.</p>

<p>Millions of parents have now become unpaid teachers as the first week of UK school closures came into effect.</p>
<p>But some exhausted mums and dads failed to keep their excited offspring in check — leaving them in awe of the real classroom heroes.</p>
<p>All kids&rsquo; playgrounds across the UK will be shut int the lockdown, but parks will stay open.</p>
<p>There will be no road or rail closures, to allow key workers to get to and from work.</p>
<p>And Brits are still allowed to go to work if they cannot work at home, but only if they can stay two metres apart from each other during it.</p>

<p>That means construction sites won’t yet have to close, and delivery services can continue.</p>
<p>Shops that can stay open are supermarkets, pharmacies, vets, pet shops, hardware stores, retail shops in hospitals, newsagents, petrol stations, banks, post offices, laundrettes and undertakers.</p>
<p>All others must close, including clothes shops and electronics stores.</p>

<p>Mr Hancock called for army of 250,000 volunteers to help with the nationwide effort, describing the ideal candidates as ‘people in good health’, whose roles would include ‘shopping, the delivery of medicines and support for those who are shielding to protect their own health’.</p>

<h3 id="italy-reports-683-more-coronavirus-deaths-live-updates">Italy reports 683 more coronavirus deaths: Live updates</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/25/748d5434e732463eacde2df3e55a1993_18.jpg" alt="img">
Italy reported 683 new deaths in the coronavirus pandemic, bringing its total to 7,503.</p>
<p>Spain, meanwhile, recorded more than 700 deaths over the past 24 hours - surpassing China in the global death toll - making the country now second to only Italy.</p>
<p>US leaders struck an agreement on a sweeping $2 trillion measure to aid workers, businesses, and a healthcare system strained by the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. However, by the end of Wednesday the deal appeared to have stalled.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>More than 113,000 of the 454,000 people diagnosed with the disease have recovered, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. About 20,500 people worldwide have died from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Here are the latest updates:</p>
<p>Wednesday, March 25</p>
<p>21:59 GMT - $2 trillion virus rescue bill hits late snags in Senate</p>
<p>Senate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties&rsquo; leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fight has arrived on our shores,&rdquo; said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. &ldquo;We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we&rsquo;re going to win it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>21:57 GMT - Pentagon orders halt overseas movement for US military</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper issued a stop movement order to the US military halting travel and movement abroad for up to 60 days in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus through the ranks, the Pentagon chief told Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>The measure is by far the military&rsquo;s most sweeping to date and will affect forces around the world.</p>
<p>Esper said in an interview the order applied to all US troops, civilian personnel and families, but noted there would be some exceptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purpose is to make sure that we&rsquo;re not bringing the virus back home, infecting others, that we&rsquo;re not spreading it around the military,&rdquo; Esper said.</p>
<p>Esper said one exception to the order would be the drawdown under way in Afghanistan, which will continue.</p>
<p>21:54 GMT - Undocumented in US have few protections from virus fallout</p>
<p>Some 10 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants are believed to live in the US. Many earn their living as domestic workers, or in the restaurant, service or construction industries - sectors of the economy that have ground to a halt as mandatory stay-at-home orders have taken effect.</p>
<p>It is unclear what, if any, government support tax-paying undocumented immigrants might receive to help them cope with the fallout from coronavirus.</p>

<p>21:52 GMT - US stocks close higher, but rally lost steam on stimulus haggling</p>
<p>Stock markets posted their first back-to-back gains since early February, but the rally lost steam near the close of trading as Senate Republicans and Democrats appeared to be at loggerheads over portions of a blockbuster $2 trillion aid package to help counter the economic damage spawned by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 495.64 points, or 2.39 percent. It had been trading nearly 1,200 points higher only 15 minutes from the market close.</p>

<p>The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen has said that it supports the Yemeni government decision to accept the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s call for a ceasefire in Yemen to combat the spread of coronavirus, state news agency SPA reported, citing the coalition&rsquo;s spokesman.</p>
<p>Spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki added the coalition supports the UN envoy&rsquo;s efforts for a ceasefire, de-escalation, and taking practical steps to build confidence between the two parties in the humanitarian and economic aspects, SPA said.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates will restrict the movement of traffic and people from 8 pm (16 GMT) on Thursday to 6 am on Sunday as it disinfects public transport and public facilities, state news agency WAM has said.</p>

<p>The Finnish government has issued a three-week blockade of the Uusimaa region around Helsinki, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in Finland, to prevent people from travelling and spreading the virus to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The decision came after Finnish health authority updated and worsened its forecast for the outbreak earlier on Wednesday, estimating that between 11,000 and 15,500 people would be hospitalised in Finland, and that from 3,600 to 5,000 of them would require intensive care in the following months.</p>
<p>By Wednesday, authorities had counted three deaths and 880 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Finland, most of them in the capital region.</p>

<p>Pompeo and several US officials have used the term recently in an apparent attempt to emphasise that the virus originated in China. Some Chinese officials have pushed a conspiracy theory in recent days that the virus was introduced to the country by the US military.</p>
