<p>A county without a “Seat!”– – Back in from Washoe yesterday. He reports a queer state of affairs there. It seems that on Tuesday the “Kidnapper Case” came up in District Court, and that the defense raised a point that there could be no trial of it in Washoe county is so much as that place was no longer the county seat. Beck says that the judge took the matter under advisement and finally concluded that Washoe city was only a de facto County seat and that Reno was merely such de jure in that between the two des there was really no county seat at all! Under the state of affairs the court thought it advisable to postpone the case until the 15th of July; and the jurymen and witnesses were ordered to appear at Reno on that date.</p>

<p>Brimstone corner: While on his way from Silver Peak, Joggles Wright stopped to camp and built a fire where deposits of Sulphur and Alum exist. He left the camp and his campfire spread to the surrounding Sulphur and has been burning ever since. Immense volumes of smoke are issuing from it, and the air is permeated with sulphurous fumes—making one think the infernal regions are not far off. (Reeve River Reveille)</p>

They are of the exclusive sort, but frequently come down on summer afternoons. It is not uncommon for the big head of the family, a grey spider about the size of a trade dollar, to drop down from the ceiling and walk over the page as if to inspect the work.

<h3 id="sicily-island-of-beauty-and-conflict--kcw-london">&ldquo;Sicily: Island of Beauty and Conflict – KCW London&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kcwtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lloyd-Nunag-Nurse-e1589561708592.jpg" alt="img">
The author opens his book with a quote from Winston Churchill writing about the Balkans, ‘They produce more history than they can consume,’ underlining the problems facing any writer trying to bottle the essence of Sicily. He cites beauty, conflict, civilisation and chaos as being the four ingredients that define the island. He has split his book into four main headings, namely History, Cities, Ancient Sites and Artists.</p>
<p>The history is told in quite a dry way, secco, rather than dolce, with outbursts of colour, interspersed with lists of monarchs, princes, emperor, emirs, governors, archbishops and barons, all jostling for position in this most fluid of kingdoms, as invasion after invasion is watched by its incredulous inhabitants like an unfolding pageant. After the Normans left, Frederick II was the most powerful monarch in Europe, being Holy Roman Emperor, King of Germany, Jerusalem and Sicily, and he ruled his empire until his death in 1250. The French had a session of rule but were thrown off the island by the Spanish, who controlled it until the arrival of Garibaldi in 1860. It is a complex scenario, and Dummett does well to tabulate events. There is a large gap in the narrative until Domenico Caracciolo becomes viceroy, appointed by the Bourbon King Ferdinand in 1781, and his attempts at reform were met with a solid barrier by the aristocracy who controlled the island’s wealth through their large estates, the latifondi, which were worked by peasants to produce the grain, which had long been Sicily’s main export. The author references Giuseppi di Lampedusa’s The Leopard, published in 1958, which was set in Garibaldi’s Risorgimento campaign and, for whom, the main protagonist Prince Fabrizio di Salina, change was not welcome. Tancredi, the Prince’s nephew, comes up with the quotable line: ‘If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.’</p>
<p>The outbreak of the French Revolution, followed by the Napoleonic Wars, put a hold on any kind of land reform, and Bourbon rule in Sicily was suspended as Britain became involved in the island through the presence of Nelson’s fleet in the Mediterranean, and the island became a British Protectorate. Garibaldi certainly brought change, landing in Marsala with his troops and liberating Sicily from the beastly Bourbons. There were revolutions in Palermo, Naples, Rome, Venice and Florence in 1848, as well as in France, the German states and Central Europe. They were fuelled, as Dummett states, ‘by a common desire among citizens for more participation in government and an end to authoritarian rule.’ Ultimately, the revolution failed to rid the island of Bourbon rule, but it paved the way for Garibaldi’s successful campaign in 1860.</p>
<p>Amongst the, mainly British, wine merchants who ran the Marsala trade, he mentions the illustrious Sicilian Florio family, including Vincenzo, but no mention of the motor race he implemented, the Targa Florio, in 1906, which would become one of the most famous and testing races in the world, rivalling the Mille Miglia and Le Mans, both of which were not started until the 1920s. He tells us twice that the townhouse in Palermo of one of the British wine merchants building up a flourishing Marsala businesses, Benjamin Ingham, is today the Grand Hotel et des Palmes, opposite to which he built an Anglican chapel. According to Dummett, he was the richest man in Sicily, if not Italy. It was not just the British who ‘invaded’ Sicily. Before these entrepreneurs, the island was settled, invaded and governed by Sicans, Sicels, Elymians (three of the ancient indigenous Sicilian tribes), Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Goths, Byzantine Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Germans (twice), French, Spaniards, Austrians, British, Americans and Italians.</p>
<p>More repetition in the narrative, this time with the Marsala merchant John Woodhouse, who, having had a chapter all to himself, crops up again in a piece on Marsala, the city, with another reference to Nelson placing a large order for his fleet. He also makes reference to the city of Mazara del Vallo, a fishing town along the coast from Marsala, but does not mention the truly spectacular find by fishermen just off the coast in 1998. Along with the octopus and sardines in their nets, they found a bronze statue of a dancing satyr from a depth of 500m, which experts at first thought was by the Greek artist Praxitales, although it is now thought to be a Roman copy from the 2nd century. It is a thing of remarkable beauty, and was on display, first in Rome, then at the RA, headlining their Bronze exhibition in 2012, then at the Louvre, and now has its own dedicated museum in the town.</p>
<p>For the artists, Dummett concentrates on eight painters, sculptors and architects, including Antonella da Messina and Antonello Gagini from the Renaissance period, four Baroque artists – the great Caravaggio, Pietro Novelli, the spectacular Giacomo Serpotta and Rosarion Gagliardi – the Belle Époque architect Ernesto Basile and the twentieth-century painter Renato Guttuso, a powerhouse of an artist, who came to a wider audience by illustrating Elizabeth David’s Italian Food. These are, for me, the best essays in the book, but, again there is a strange omission. There is no mention of the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in via Sant’Anna, Palermo, which houses some fine paintings by Sicilian artists, including a selfie by Guttuso</p>

<h3 id="al-mariam--is-egypt-secretly-planning-a-proxy-war-on-ethiopia">&ldquo;Al Mariam : Is Egypt Secretly Planning a Proxy War on Ethiopia?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://borkena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Egypt-_-GERD-_-Ethiopia-_.jpg" alt="img">
Author’s Note: In this commentary, I shall argue the Egyptian Government is in the first phase of its PROXY WAR against Ethiopia with the short-term strategic objective of sabotaging the scheduled July initial filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). To successfully wage a proxy war on Ethiopia, I believe Egypt will seek to: 1) exploit the division in Sudan’s transitional military-civilian government between hard line military officers sympathetic to Egypt and the technocrats led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok; 2) recruit key Sudanese military and intelligence leaders to whip up Sudanese nationalism against an “Ethiopian invasion” in the recent border conflict; 3) destabilize the fragile Sudanese military-civilian coalition and pave the way for a military coup that will bring to power leaders who will support Egypt’s opposition to the GERD, and 4) make arrangements with the Sudanese military for the establishment of a forward operating base in Egypt for a strike on the GERD and invasion of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>In supporting my analysis, I offer historical facts on centuries-long Egyptian ambitions to totally control the Nile River and paralyze Ethiopia from using any Nile River waters for its development.</p>
<p>Al-Mariam</p>
<p>June 6, 2020</p>
<p>“Letting loose the dogs of war” on Ethiopia?</p>
<p>For decades, Egypt has threatened to go to war with Ethiopia over use of Nile waters.</p>
<p>In September 2019, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi told the U.N. General Assembly, “The Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt.” In other words, the “Nile question” is a matter of life and death for Egypt.</p>
<p>In 2013, Egyptian president Mohammad Morsi declared, “As president of the republic, I confirm to you that all options are open. If Egypt is the Nile’s gift, then the Nile is a gift to Egypt… If it diminishes by one drop, then our blood is the alternative.” In other words, the Nile River will be a river of blood and obviously not Egyptian.</p>
<p>In 1979, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat threatened to go to war with Ethiopia dramatically declaring, “We are not going to wait to die of thirst in Egypt, we’ll go to Ethiopia and die there.” History supports Sadat’s prophesy. Tens of thousands of Egyptian soldiers (see references below) invaded Ethiopia in the 1870s and were “totally annihilated”.</p>
<p>On May 12, 2020, Ethiopia reiterated its long declared policy that it will start filling the GERD in July, 2020.</p>
<p>In response, on May 19, 2020, El-Sisi directed Egyptian armed forces to be on the “highest state of alert”.</p>
<p>If Egypt were to be foolish enough to invade Ethiopia, it would not be the first time; nor would the outcome of such an invasion be much in doubt.</p>
<p>Egypt has had imperial designs on Ethiopia at least beginning in the 1820s when Mohammad Ali Pasha sought to expand his empire throughout sub-Sahara Africa by defeating Sudan, dominating the Red Sea and controlling the port city of Massawa which was part of Ethiopia. Ali Pasha’s passion was control of the Nile and indeed the principal reason for his invasion of the Sudan. He wanted to make sure there was no interference in the flow of the Nile through the Sudan. But he was unable to reach Ethiopia, the source of the Blue Nile.</p>
<p>In 1875-76, Egypt was determined to militarily subjugate Ethiopia and control the Blue Nile once and for all. Egypt deployed a large army well-equipped and trained army led by European and American officers.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Gundet (1875) and Battle of Gura (1876), Ethiopian forces “completely annihilated an Egyptian expeditionary force”. According to one historian:</p>
<p>The Battle of Gura abolished any practical opportunity for Egypt to gain control over Ethiopia. The heavy Egyptian losses (almost 14,000 men died in three months), the economic damage to the Egyptian economy and, above all, the Egyptian depiction of the Ethiopian warriors as having a demonic character, prevented any future Egyptian invasion of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>I am not terribly worried about an Egyptian land or air war in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>With all due respect to the Egyptian military, its record of military success leaves much to be desired. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Suez Crisis, and the Six-Day War proved disastrous for Egypt.</p>
<p>The 1973 Arab-Israeli War also ended up in an Egyptian defeat, and only through the Camp David Accords was Egypt able to reclaim the Sinai.</p>
<p>Since 2013, Egypt has been involved in its largest military campaign in the Sinai peninsula since its 1973 war with Israel. Egypt deployed 88 battalions with 42,000 soldiers to defeat an ISIS-affiliated insurgency.</p>
<p>In 2018 El-Sisi launched Operation Sinai to “purge the country of terrorists”. However, “despite brutal methods and substantial military effort, the Egyptian government has little to show from the past five-plus years of counterinsurgency operations in the Sinai aside from hundreds of military and civilian casualties and an undeterred adversary.”</p>
<p>If Egypt cannot defeat a few thousand terrorists in 5 years, could it defeat Ethiopia by marching its army or flying its air force 2,300 miles?</p>
<p>But fools have rushed in where angels fear to tread.</p>
<p>In 1812, French Emperor Napoleon invaded Russia with an army of 680,000 men ending in total defeat for France. In 1942, Hitler attacked Stalingrad and ended up with his army of 330,000 men wiped out.</p>
<p>Most instructively, in 1896 Italy invaded Ethiopia with state of the art weapons and a large army and was wiped out in a battle that lasted NOT even a full day! In 1935, Italy returned to avenge its humiliating defeat and extensively used mustard gas against the civilian population. In 1941, Italy suffered another humiliating defeat.</p>
<p>Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the 2018 Nobel Peace Laureate, has cautioned the dispute with Egypt over Nile waters could be resolved only through negotiations. He warned if war is waged on Ethiopia by Egypt he “could ready millions of people”.</p>
<p>Egypt would be crossing the proverbial Rubicon River (might I say the Nile River) if it believes it can bring Ethiopia to knees on the use of the Nile waters by waging war. That will be a point of no return – no return to diplomacy, no return to peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>It would be a truly Shakespearean tragedy for Egypt if it were to “Cry “Havoc!” on the Nile and “let slip the dogs of war” on Ethiopia. The outcome is foretold in the words of Mark Antony in Julius Caesar:</p>
<p>And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,</p>
<p>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</p>
<p>Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice</p>
<p>Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war,</p>
<p>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</p>
<p>With carrion men, groaning for burial.</p>
<p>Egypt should heed the wisdom of an old African saying, “If you can’t resolve your problems in peace, you can’t solve them in war.”</p>
<p>“Egypt will defend its interest by all means available”</p>
<p>On February 28, 2020, the Egyptian Government was on social media saber-rattling and beating the psychological drums of war against Ethiopia:</p>
<p>All organs of the Egyptian State will continue to give this subject the great attention it deserves in the exercise of their national responsibilities in defending the interests, potential and future of the Egyptian people by all means available.</p>
<p>What did Egypt mean by its threat to “defend its interest in the Nile by all means available”?</p>
<p>As I explained in my March 1 commentary, Egypt intended to convey a number of sinister and intimidating messages to Ethiopia:</p>
<p>I. Egypt will conduct war on Ethiopia — a war of arms, a war of words, diplomatic wars, a proxy war and psychological warfare.</p>
<p>Propaganda war</p>
<p>I must admit Egypt today has control of the commanding heights in the war of words (propaganda). Every single day there are articles in various legacy outlets and social media platforms (arranged by Egyptian government paid public relations firms, Egyptian officials and intellectuals, internet trolls, etc.) pleading the cause of Egypt victimized by Ethiopia’s insistence on using the Nile waters in violation of international law, agreements and principles of good neighborliness. Ethiopia is depicted in Egyptian disinformation campaigns as an evil country hellbent on destroying Egypt. gypt says Ethiopia wants to sell hydro-power and become rich while Egyptians starve and die of thirst.</p>
<p>Diplomatic war</p>
<p>While Egypt has failed in its military campaigns against Ethiopia, the opposite has been true on the diplomatic front for well over a century.</p>
<p>In the Anglo Italian Protocol of 1891, Britain guaranteed to Egypt “undisturbed flow of the Nile by restricting Italy’s endeavour to control a water project over the Atbara River”, one of the tributaries of the Nile. “This protocol was signed by the colonial powers without taking into account the interest of third parties, most notably Ethiopia.”</p>
<p>In the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1902, the British tried to bamboozle Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II by claiming the English version of that treaty prohibited Ethiopia from initiating any projects on the Nile River without the permission of Britain and Sudan. The Amharic version of that treaty read, Emperor Menelik II “has entered into the commitment of not giving permission to any work that fully arrests the flow of the Blue Nile.”</p>
<p>In the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty of 1929, super-special rights were granted to Egypt including guarantees of 48cm Nile flow per year, the right to monitor the Nile flow in the upstream countries and the right to veto any construction projects that would affect her interests adversely, among other things.</p>
<p>1959 Nile Waters Agreement Between Egypt and the Sudan guaranteed Egypt 84 billion cubic meters of water measured at Aswan High Dam. It also granted Egypt the right to construct the Aswan High Dam that can store the entire annual Nile River flow of a year.</p>
<p>In 1983, Egypt formed the Ndugu Group Including a number of sub-Saharan countries excluding Ethiopia) with the aim of “creating a multi-good socio-economic solutions beyond consumptive water uses.” The idea was to buy off African countries into supporting Egypt’s claim of birthright to exclusive use of the Nile. The Group fizzled out.</p>
<p>In 2020, El-Sisi, using Donald Trump’s son in law Jared Kushner, managed to get Ethiopia to attend the so-called “Washington Talks” on the GERD. Egypt and the U.S. fabricated an agreement and tried to sweet talk, con and arm-twist Ethiopia into mortgaging its future. Ethiopia told Egypt and the U.S. to shove their fake agreement up their keister.</p>
<p>Egypt has provided diplomatic and military support to invaders of Ethiopia. When Somalia’s Siad Barre invaded Ethiopia in 1977, he got his weapons daily from Egypt. The New York Times reported, “Egyptian plane has been sent almost every day recently with light weapons and ammunition for the hard-pressed Somalis.”</p>
<p>Psychological warfare</p>
<p>Egypt continues to wage psychological warfare against Ethiopia by threatening unspecified military action. Egypt intimates it will undertake a surgical air strike of the GERD.</p>
<p>II. Egypt will actively work to destabilize Ethiopia, including the promotion of asymmetric wars and by meddling in Ethiopian internal matters.</p>
<p>Egypt’s involvement and meddling in Ethiopian affairs has longstanding roots. Egyptian intelligence has funneled money to extremist groups in Ethiopia for decades. For more than one-half century, Egypt has provided financial support and weapons to rebel groups in northern and eastern Ethiopia. That effort continues today as Egypt provides safe haven for criminals and terrorists who have fled Ethiopia after committing crimes against humanity. It is an open secret that various extremists groups continue to receive support directly or indirectly from Egypt. No doubt, Egypt will continue to actively promote ethnic and religious tensions in Ethiopia by providing arms and money to any group who will work with them to destabilize the country. Of course, there is nothing Egypt will not do to undermine or otherwise weaken the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed!</p>
<p>III. Egypt will use diplomatic means to isolate Ethiopia in the region and throughout the continent and the world.</p>
<p>For decades, Egypt has campaigned to isolate Ethiopia politically and economically from the international community. It has succeeded in preventing the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund from extending loans for the GERD or other construction projects and other economic development efforts on the Nile. In March, Egypt got the Arab League to condemn Ethiopia for alleged “infringement of Egypt’s historical rights to Nile waters.” In May, Egypt sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council “protesting Ethiopia’s plan to start filling the reservoir of the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam”. UN Secretary General António Guterres responded by advising Ethiopia and Egypt to resolve their differences within the framework of the “2015 Declaration of Principles on the GERD, which emphasizes cooperation based on common understanding, mutual benefit, good faith, win-win, and the principles of international law.”</p>
<p>Egypt has sought to enlist support from the European Union, various European and African countries to isolate Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Is Egypt planning a proxy war on Ethiopia to stop the GERD?</p>
<p>In my March commentary trying to decipher the meaning of the phrase, “Egypt will defend its interest by all means available”, I argued Egypt will wage a proxy war on Ethiopia. In other words, Egypt will use a neighboring country to destabilize, distract and thwart Ethiopia’s effort to begin the initial filling of the GERD scheduled for July and otherwise prevent the completion of the Dam.</p>
<p>I have come to this conclusion studying open source intelligence materials readily available online and in the legacy media.</p>
<p>Egypt has always sought a forward operating base to launch an attack on Ethiopia.</p>
<p>A Stratfor analysis, the American geopolitical intelligence platform, in 2012 concluded, “Sudanese president Umar al-Bashir has agreed to allow the Egyptians to build a small airbase in Kusti to accommodate Egyptian commandos who might be sent to Ethiopia to destroy water facilities on the Blue Nile… It will be their option if everything else fails.”</p>
<p>Does Egypt today believe “everything has failed” to stop Ethiopia from beginning to fill the Dam in July or complete it?</p>
<p>Al-Bashir is no longer in power but that does not mean Egypt has abandoned its plan to use the Sudan in any way it can to advance its military objectives. There are the Al-Bashir old guards still around ready to serve at Egypt’s beck and call.</p>
<p>Egypt understands and wants to exploit the fragile political situation in the Sudan. Open source intelligence sources indicate that Sudan’s transitional military-civilian government is struggling not only to pave the way for free and fair elections in the coming two years but also address the severe economic and social problems facing the Sudanese people today. In much the same way as nearly every country in the world, Sudan is facing the scourge of COVID-19. Sudan is facing intense financial pressure on households, soaring inflation and budget deficits. While US sanctions against the Sudan were lifted in 2017, global commercial banks are not willing to extend loans and the Sudan is “effectively cut off from the global financial system.” In 2019, the World Bank threatened to deny any new loans until the Sudan paid off $16 billion in arrears to financial institutions and sovereign creditors. Sudan’s complex economic problems have been fully documented.</p>
<p>There have been recent border skirmishes on the Ethiopian-Sudan border. The alleged attack occurred in the eastern Sudanese province of al-Qadarif by “an Ethiopian militia group penetrated Sudan’s border to fetch water at the Atbara river.” The Ethiopian Government has called for a joint investigation of the incident and offered its “deep sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims of the conflict along the Ethiopia and Sudan border.” Regardless, Ethiopia and the Sudan can deploy a joint force to patrol the border area to prevent any violence.</p>
<p>However, I believe Egypt will try to expand the border conflict in any way it can.</p>
<p>My analysis of the open source intelligence is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are military elements in the Sudanese military-civilian coalition who are supportive of Egypt’s position to thwart the completion of the GERD. Egypt wants to strengthen them and enable them to take a dominant role in the current coalition so that they can serve its interests in preventing the completion of the GERD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Egypt is actively recruiting elements of the Sudanese military to make a move on the military-civilian coalition by drumming up nationalist sentiment against Ethiopia and possibly engineer a coup d’état. Special Note: On March 5, 2020, Sudan “expressed reservation” on “Arab League support for the water rights of Egypt.” On March 9, 2020, an assassination attempt was made on Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Egypt sees an opportunity to expand the border conflict and plunge the two countries into an all-out war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Egypt will engage mercenaries in the al-Qadarif area to stoke up the conflict so that an all-out war occurs between Ethiopia and the Sudan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current border conflict occurred between Ethiopia and the Sudan for the first time in 50 years even though the countries share a 1,600-mile-long border and have yet to have clearly demarcated borders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what made the difference in getting the two countries to be tangled up in a border war?</p>
<p>The difference is EGYPT!</p>
<p>Egypt wants to use the Sudan as its pawn in its Game of Nile River Hegemony.</p>
<p>Egypt wants the Sudan to fight a proxy war for it against Ethiopia and in the process delay or prevent the completion of the GERD Dam.</p>
<p>I believe Egypt has a secret plan to get the Sudan and Ethiopia mired in a war of attrition which will deplete them both and give Egypt an opportunity to control them.</p>
<p>It is the classic divide and rule. Stoke up Sudanese nationalism and divide the military-civilian coalition. Divide Ethiopia and the Sudan by creating a border conflict and watch the two countries dissipate in a game of attrition and ultimately proclaim victory on both Ethiopia and the Sudan.</p>
<p>That has been the fundamental policy and strategy of Egypt since the days of Muhammad Ali Pasha in the 1820s.</p>
<p>THE BOTTOM LINE: Egypt wants to use a weak Sudan to fight its dirty proxy war against Ethiopia to control the Nile.</p>
<p>EGYPT WILL FAIL!</p>
<p>The reports further alleged that the Sudanese transitional government has been divided over the dam, as the military component is backed by Egypt and the civilian component is led by Hamdok, who is considered close to Ethiopia.</p>

<h3 id="how-samuel-hemmans-helped-give-napoleon-the-elba">&ldquo;How Samuel Hemmans helped give Napoleon the Elba…&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://insidecroydon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hmscurlew-e1593168391259.jpg" alt="img">
MARVELS OF THE MINSTER: Many gravestones and memorials were lost when the area around Croydon’s parish church was redesigned in the 1960s to allow the construction of the Roman Way dual carriageway. One such stone commemorated the Hemmans family. DAVID MORGAN tells their story</p>
<p>On the Hemmans family memorial in the churchyard of what was once known as the Croydon Parish Church had the following information: “Samuel Hemmans, late of Chatham Dockyard, d June 14th 1819 aged 74, Ann his widow d Oct 22, 1833 aged 81, Susannah Hinton her sister, d Dec 18th 1845, Samuel Hood Hemmans, Lieut. R.N. d at Ceylon, May 2 1854 aged 62, Mary Eliza Hemmans, d Feb 15th 1872, aged 81, Thos. Hinton Hemmans, Lieut.-Colonel d Nov 17th 1873, aged 79, Ann Hemmans, d April 1 1875 aged 75.”</p>
<p>The lives of the two Hemmans brothers, Samuel Hood Hemmans and Thomas Hinton Hemmans, provide rich examples of military life in war-dominated early 19th Century England.</p>
<p>Strean’s Victorian book Croydon In The Past has a note beside the family’s memorial entry. It said that the Hemmans family were originally from Mitcham, where they ran a brewery in Lower Mitcham. He also wrote that William Hood Hemmans, the brothers’ grandfather, was churchwarden of Mitcham Parish Church in 1820 and that his name was cast on one of the bells. William was buried right by Mitcham Church together with his wife.</p>
<p>That memorial refers to “other family members who lie in sacred places”.</p>
<p>Samuel Hood Hemmans and Thomas Hinton Hemmans were the sons of Samuel Hemmans, the first name on the memorial. He was the Master Attendant of the Docks at Chatham, responsible for managing the ships in harbour and seeing to the maintenance of the vessels laid up there. He had previously been employed in similar positions at Sheerness and Plymouth, retiring in 1816 and eventually moving to Croydon.</p>
<p>With a father so involved with the sea, it was no surprise that young Samuel Hemmans should join the Royal Navy. This he did on July 10, 1806 when, at the age of 14, he became a Volunteer 1st Class on the recently built 22-gun ship HMS Boreas, under Captain Robert Scott, with a crew of 200 officers and men. This was just nine months after the great victory over the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, and the heroic death of Admiral Lord Nelson – a time to stir the patriotic passions of any young lad eager to make his way in the world.</p>
<p>Samuel quickly saw active service in the capture in October 1807 of a privateer ship La Victoire.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, though, on November 28, disaster hit when the Boreas struck rocks off Guernsey and sank, with the loss of Scott and 120 men. Only 68 of her crew survived, which included Samuel.</p>
<p>By this time, Samuel Hemmans had risen to the rank of Midshipman, and he was then set to work on a variety of ships – including HMS Resolution, HMS Pompee, HMS Volage and HMS Resistance – before he was appointed to HMS Undaunted, a 38-gun frigate, and gained his commission as a Lieutenant in 1813, at a time when the Napoleonic wars still raged across Europe, following France’s ultimately doomed invasion of Russia in 1812.</p>
<p>The Undaunted was part of the British fleet which harried and attacked the French and blockaded their Mediterranean ports. In November 1813, after attacking Port-la-Nouvelle, the ship’s commander, Captain Thomas Ussher, noted in his report that they captured two vessels and destroyed five. This brought to a total of 70 ships either destroyed or captured in the previous 10 months that he been in command of the vessel. The French fleet had never recovered after the defeat at Trafalgar, and British naval dominance was used to starve Napoleon’s armies of outside assistance.</p>
<p>One evening, in early April 1814, while stationed off Marseilles, the Undaunted’s crew noticed unusual lights from the shore. The next morning they were approached by a boat flying a flag of truce and carrying deputation including the mayor and civil authorities of the city. After the British had captured Paris, Napoleon had been taken prisoner and forced to abdicate.</p>
<p>Captain Ussher went ashore, where he received orders from the British forces’ commander, Lord Castlereagh, to prepare to convey Bonaparte into exile on the small Italian island of Elba.</p>
<p>The Undaunted, with 22-year-old Samuel Hood Hemmans among its crew, set sail to St Tropez and then to Frejus, where Napoleon was being held under guard in a hotel. On the evening of April 28, Napoleon, plus a retinue of some of his followers and representatives of the French allies, boarded the ship and set sail.</p>
<p>Five days later Napoleon disembarked on to the island to begin his first period of exile.</p>
<p>I think the crew, including Samuel, would have made much of the spectacle of seeing Napoleon deposited on an island and, most probably, looked forward to the prospect of a free drink or two while describing the events.</p>
<p>HMS Undaunted continued its Mediterranean patrols, and with good reason – Bonaparte would escape in February 1815 to begin the four-month campaign which would end at the Battle of Waterloo that June.</p>
<p>After two years serving on the Undaunted, Samuel Hemmans did not return to England until the October of that year, when most of the crew were paid off – furloughed, as Europe was at peace for the first time in Hemmans’ lifetime.</p>
<p>Samuel continued his career in the Royal Navy. He joined HMS Bulwark first, then HMS Curlew, in which he saw action in 1820 at Ras-al-Khyma in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Here, they fought pirates, eventually seizing their stronghold and capturing a large quantity of treasure. From 1824 to 1827, Hemmans was part of the crew of HMS Blanche, stationed off South America.</p>
<p>His final posting was with HMS Herald, which in 1829 sailed to Cartegena, a Colombian port on the Caribbean, then to Quebec and home. The crew were paid off in early 1830 and that was the end of Samuel Hemmans’s 24 years at sea.</p>
<p>“Join the Navy and see the World” was a late 20th Century recruiting slogan for the senior service, and Hemmans certainly managed to fulfil that during his life on the ocean waves, though when he retired from active service, he was still a lieutenant, a relatively junior rank he had held for 17 action-packed years without ever being given command of a ship of his own.</p>
<p>That same year that he retired from the Royal Navy, Samuel Hood Hemmans, by now 38, married Emma Jane Weatherall in Gillingham, near the Chatham docks. Over the next 14 years, they went on to have five children in the next 14 years.</p>
<p>Their third child, another Samuel, was baptised in 1838 in Greenock, near Glasgow in Scotland. The family had relocated there after Lt Samuel had taken a new job as an Emigration Agent at the port with the firm of Goode and Lawrence.</p>
<p>We know nothing more about Samuel himself other than he died on May 22 1854, aged 61. The transcription from the old gravestone is curious because it stated Samuel died in Ceylon. A genealogical search suggests that he died in Newington, Walworth, south London.</p>
<p>His wife, Emma, died in 1886 in St Lawrence, Kent aged 84.</p>
<p>Samuel Hemmans was remembered on the Croydon memorial where his parents were buried together with his aunt. His brother Thomas, the other military figure, was buried in the family grave in Croydon. He always kept the family property at 13 George Street, likely to have been a large house at the time, just up from where the Almshouses are today.</p>
<p>Thomas Hinton Hemmans had a much more low-key life in the military than his sailor brother, and in a 32-year career in the army never saw active service. He was in the 78th Highland Regiment, which was later known as the Seaforth Highlanders, a unit best known for its defence of Lucknow in India during the siege in the Indian Rebellion in 1857 (long after Thomas had retired).</p>
<p>Thomas Hemmans was commissioned into the army aged 17, as an ensign from May 1811, lieutenant from 1813, captain from 1826, and brevet major from 1841. His regiment served in Ireland and departed for a tour in Ceylon – modern-day Sri Lanka – in 1826, not returning until 12 years later, in 1838. Such was the life of a professional soldier in England as it entered the Victorian era.</p>
<p>Hemmans was unmarried, sharing his home at 13 George Street with his sisters, Mary and Ann, both spinsters, who are also buried in the family grave. By the time of his death at his George Street home, aged 79 in 1873, Thomas had reached the rank of colonel.</p>
<p>The family memorial in Croydon Parish churchyard held so many memories. Thomas, telling all and sundry about his time abroad with the 78th, his brother coming to Croydon and recollecting his memories of years at sea. Their father, in his lifetime, was proud of how well he had done in life and will have told stories about his boys serving the crown and travelling around the world.</p>
<p>“He got that rotter Napoleon on to that island. Did I ever tell you that?” you can imagine him regaling anyoone who might listen. Let’s raise a glass to the Hemmans family, a Croydon family with aspirations and loyal service.</p>
<p>*Editor’s note: “How Samuel Hemmans helped give Napoleon the Elba…” With apologies to Morecambe and Wise. And David Morgan</p>

<p>The year is 1815 and, on a sun-drenched afternoon in Brixham, a baker by the name of Michelmore is rowing his small boat out into the bay.</p>
<p>Laden with loaves, rolls and buns, he is hoping to sell his produce to the men aboard the intimidating Royal Navy warships which arrived off the coast earlier that morning.</p>
<p>Food on the vessels is notoriously poor, and Michelmore knows he can make good money if he is the first one there to sell his produce.</p>
<p>Britain - still riding a wave of euphoria following her victory over the French at Waterloo a month earlier - has announced a national holiday, so Michelmore has three children who would usually be at school helping him in his boat instead.</p>
<p>After latching onto one particularly huge ship named Bellerophon with his boat hook, Michelmore announces his presence - and his boat-load of bread.</p>
<p>(Image: Sky/The Biography Channel)</p>
<p>But rather than being welcomed with their fresh produce with open arms, they are told to keep their distance.</p>
<p>“If we want bread we’ll come ashore and fetch it,” bellows an officer. &ldquo;And if you don’t let go we’ll sink you.”</p>
<p>John Smart, one of the schoolboys on the small boat, looks up to see a sentry pointing his musket at them. He then puts down his weapon, before picking up &lsquo;a large cannon ball, which he held exactly over my head&hellip; To my great relief Michelmore let go and we were soon out of harm’s way&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Michelmore and the boys are perplexed. Why are sailors who are usually so eager to enjoy freshly-baked bread turning them away?</p>
<p>It is then that Smart notices someone: “At one of the lower-deck ports a man nodding violently to us&hellip; His eyes caught mine for an instant as he put his fingers to his lips with a warning gesture.”</p>
<p>Michelmore continues to row away, only for the man to throw a bottle into the water. They keep an eye on the bottle and, after making sure the sentries are no longer watching, they make a detour and collect it.</p>
<p>Smart grabs the small black bottle from the water, uncorks it and stares in amazement at the six words scrawled on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got Bonaparte on board.”</p>
<p>From Emperor to outlaw</p>
<p>Napoleon came to power in the years following the French Revolution, and in 1804 he crowned himself Emperor of France.</p>
<p>From 1803 to 1814, France fought a series of conflicts across Europe. Despite a series of incredible victories for Napoleon, they culminated in his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812.</p>
<p>More costly defeats ultimately saw Napoleon abdicate, and he was exiled to Elba - a small island off the coast of Italy - in 1814.</p>
<p>However, this did not last long, and less than a year later he escaped back to France where he remained popular.</p>
<p>He quickly amassed an army, but Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia quickly declared him an outlaw and assembled a huge army to end his reign for good.</p>
<p>It was known as the Hundred Days, and it came to a shuddering halt at Waterloo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The nearest-run thing you ever saw&rsquo;</p>
<p>After some smaller clashes, the two armies faced off at Waterloo on June 18, 1815.</p>
<p>Napoleon knew time was against him: in front of him was the Duke of Wellington, and the Prussian Army was only a matter of miles away and marching to help the British.</p>
<p>The French attacked repeatedly but could not force their way past the red coats and, by late afternoon, the Prussians started arriving.</p>
<p>Napoleon knew the game was up and, despite a desperate last throw of the dice with his best troops, he was beaten.</p>
<p>It was &lsquo;the nearest-run thing you ever saw&rsquo;, said Wellington later.</p>
<p>He fled first to Paris, then Rochefort on France&rsquo;s western coast where he contemplated fleeing to America. But with British ships blocking every port as they hunted for him, he decided against it and surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland on HMS Bellerophon on July 15.</p>
<p>(Image: National Maritime Museum/PA)</p>
<p>Waterloo to Torbay</p>
<p>Maitland received orders from the Admiralty to make for the nearest British port, so he headed for Torbay.</p>
<p>Somewhat optimistically considering France had been at war with Britain almost continuously for the last 23 years, Napoleon had actually written a letter to the Prince Regent appealing to the &lsquo;hospitality of the British Nation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exposed to the factions which divide my country, and to the enmity of the great powers of Europe, I have terminated my political career, and I come, like Themistocles, to throw myself on the hospitality of the British Nation,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I place myself under the protection of its laws, which I claim from your Royal Highness as the most powerful, the most constant and the most generous of my enemies. Napoleon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;If H.R.H. sees no objection to granting me passports to go to the United States, it would be my intention to go there. But I do not desire to go to any other colony. If I cannot go to America, I wish to stay in England,assuming the name of Muiron or Duroc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would need a house large enough for my staff&hellip;.If the Government intends to provide me with a superintendent, he must not be jailer but a man of quality and honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, his request was refused.</p>
<p>Instead, he found himself a prisoner aboard Bellerophon, which arrived off the Torbay coast early on the morning of July 24 as the victors decided what to do with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quel bon pays&rsquo; he reportedly said when he saw the Devon coastline: What a beautiful country.</p>
<p>From Torbay to Plymouth&hellip;then back to Torbay</p>
<p>Napoleon later said that the view reminded him of the Bay of Ferrajo on Elba, where he had first been exiled.</p>
<p>Despite repeated pleas though, Maitland rejected his request to be allowed on shore.</p>
<p>Debate continues over where Bellerophon actually dropped anchor, with both London Bridge and Berry Head mentioned in accounts.</p>
<p>Another version reads: “They reached Torbay on 24th, where Maitland took up position near the Orestone whence his masts could be seen from Teignmouth Den over Hope’s Nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In reply to his signals he was ordered to prohibit communication with the shore and await Admiralty orders three leagues out at sea.”</p>
<p>There was a certain irony that he ended up off the coast in Torbay. Not only were smugglers in the area said to do a roaring trade with their French counterparts for cognac and French wine, but the South Devon coastline had actually benefited hugely in a tourism capacity.</p>

<p>With continental Europe off-limits due to war, wealthy people had flocked to Devon for their holidays instead.</p>
<p>It was also close to British naval bases, making it ideal for officers and their wives.</p>
<p>Berry Head Fort had also been built to protect the area from French invasion.</p>
<p>After Smart read the message in the bottle, he returned to shore and &lsquo;in five minutes after we reached shore there was not a soul in Brixham, except babies, ignorant of the news&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The area soon became overwhelmed with people flooding in to try and catch a glimpse of the fallen Emperor.</p>
<p>It was soon decided to move Bellerophon to Plymouth, which was more secure and better-equipped to deal with the huge crowds. But this simply drew even more curious onlookers - one source estimated 10,000 people per day were streaming into the area.</p>
<p>Pubs, restaurants and hotels were doing a fine trade, but the Royal Navy was concerned and so returned to Torbay several days later.</p>
<p>Life on board</p>
<p>Napoleon was showered with gifts from the public, including flowers, fruit and cards.</p>
<p>People would go out in small boats dressed in their finest clothes, hoping to catch the emperor&rsquo;s eye as he enjoyed one of his many strolls on deck.</p>
<p>At 6pm each evening, a gong would sound and he would head below deck for dinner.</p>
<p>Despite being treated well, Napoleon and his companions were becoming frustrated at not being allowed on shore.</p>
<p>Napoleon’s guardian, Lord Keith, wrote: “You cannot imagine what a crowd we have here.The inns are full and the sea covered with swarms of small boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I conceive that I must be particularly vigilant, for the ‘General’ and his suite are convinced that once they set foot on shore, no power on earth can bring them back again. They are determined to disembark. It is all they talk of and they are becoming very aggressive.”</p>
<p>Alas, there was to be no stepping foot on English soil.</p>
<p>On July 30 - a day before the official announcement - Maitland informed his captive that he would be exiled to St Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, almost 5,000 miles away.</p>
<p>On August 7, Napoleon and his loyal group boarded Northumberland and sailed to his final destination.</p>
<p>There, he lived out the final six years of his life in poor conditions, unhappy and ill.</p>
<p>He died on May 5, 1821.

The world’s oldest restaurant will open its doors again today after closing for the first time in its 295-year history because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Botín, which opened in Madrid in 1725, where Goya was reputed to have washed dishes and Hemingway feasted regularly on suckling pig, closed for three months when Spain went into lockdown. It had previously withstood French invasion and civil war.</p>
<p>However, the flame of its oven, which has never been extinguished, was kept lit throughout the lockdown, Antonio González, the owner, said.</p>
<p>“We didn’t let the flame go out for romantic and symbolic reasons as well as practical ones,” said Mr González among the bustle of preparations for reopening. “We wanted to keep the oven fired up — as they work
