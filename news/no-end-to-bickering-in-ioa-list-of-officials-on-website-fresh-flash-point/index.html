<p>By PTI</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: Indian Olympic Association President Narinder Batra on Monday asked Secretary General Rajeev Mehta to reinstate the names of associate members on the body&rsquo;s website after an official complained about their removal.</p>
<p>The IOA website mentions names of nine Vice Presidents, six Joint Secretaries and 10 Executive members.</p>
<p>Batra asked Mehta to put the names of the associate members on the Executive Council back on the site.</p>
<p>The role of the associate members is limited as they can&rsquo;t even vote when executive council meeting lacks consensus on an issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have shared with you message received from Mr Sahdev Yadav about removal of names from IOA website of all the Associate Vice Presidents, Associate Joint Secretaries and Associate Executive Council Members,&rdquo; Batra wrote in his e-mail to Mehta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case, it is done by mistake then request please have all the Associate Category EC names put back on the IOA website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they have been removed under your unilateral instructions then I am requesting and advising you to have them put back on IOA website on urgent and priority basis,&rdquo; Batra wrote.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: IOA vice-president Sudhanshu Mittal says FIH clean chit to Narinder Batra is eyewash</p>
<p>Mehta, on his part, said the matter has been sorted after a conversation with Yadav and the names of the associated members have been made available in another section of the official website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The list of Associate members are put in a different section of the website. I already cleared it with Mr. Sahdev Yadav ji who raised the matter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;only elected members (names) are given in the Executive Council section as per the constitution of IOA,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>A power tussle between the key officials of the IOA has been going on for some time.</p>
<p>It all began when Batra told Mehta that he wants to take over a few responsibilities from him to &ldquo;share his burden&rdquo;.

<p><img src="https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Narinder-Batra.jpg" alt="img">
Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Narinder Batra has encouraged the nation to celebrate Olympic Day on 23 June. He stated that there is a need to participate in such events to make India into an active sports participation nation.</p>
<p>Olympic Day is celebrated every year on 23 June since 1948 to mark the beginning of the modern-day Olympic Games.</p>
<p>“One way of making India embark on a journey from a sports-watching nation to a more active sports-participating nation is to commemorate such milestones in such a manner that people around the Olympic community would be inspired to play any sport of their choice,” he was quoted as saying by the Olympic Channel on their official website.</p>
<p>“There are countless ways in which we can do this, even with the social-distancing restrictions in place. It could be some form of physical activity that each of us undertakes. It could even be a way of encouragement to Olympic sport.”</p>
<p>“I urge India’s Olympic medallists and Olympians to lead the celebrations. It would be delightful to see our educational institutions get the student community involved,” he added.

<h3 id="ioa-vice-president-slams-ioc-and-fih-for-refusing-to-take-action-against-batra">&ldquo;IOA vice-president slams IOC and FIH for refusing to take action against Batra&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.insidethegames.biz/media/image/179670/o/batra4.jpg" alt="img">
IOA vice-president slams IOC and FIH for refusing to take action against Batra</p>
<p>Indian Olympic Association (IOA) vice-president Sudhanshu Mittal has criticised the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Hockey Federation (FIH) for refusing to take action against Narinder Batra.</p>
<p>Mittal has launched a concerted campaign to have Batra removed from his roles as President of the IOA and FIH in recent weeks after claiming his ascent to the top job at the two organisations was illegitimate.</p>
<p>The senior IOA official is continuing with his efforts despite the IOC Ethics Commission and the FIH Integrity Unit dismissing his allegations against Batra, who has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Mittal alleges neither the IOC nor the FIH has taken his complaints further owing to their partnerships with India, which is due to host the 2021 IOC Session and has a close commercial relationship with the worldwide hockey body.</p>
<p>In a letter to IOC Ethics Commission chairman Ban Ki-moon, seen by insidethegames, Mittal claims the decision not to take action against Batra - an IOC member by virtue of his IOA Presidency - represented a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I strongly denunciate the quick dismissal of the complaint,&rdquo; Mittal wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rushed and tweaked response by staff without referring the complaint to the Ethics Commission, when the concerned is a member of the IOC by virtue of his role in a National Olympic Committee, that is due to host the Session of the IOC, has conflict of interest marred all over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took time for me to respond because this single reply exposed the lack of consistency in the principles of good governance, which has a far reaching impact on our National Olympic Committee over the last decade, and for many other sporting organisations in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mittal has also accused FIH chief executive Thierry Weil of &ldquo;selling the soul of the sport for personal gains of an individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to Weil, also seen by insidethegames, the IOA vice-president claims the FIH has turned a blind eye to the allegations against Batra.</p>
<p>The IOA vice-president has written to both the IOC and the FIH ©ITG</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the three sponsors of the International Hockey Federation, two are Indian,&rdquo; Mittal writes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the two, one of them is also the sponsor of Hockey India, so Hockey India is also a source of funding for the FIH.</p>
<p>&ldquo;India is also the host of the World Cup and other international events in the coming years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence the reservation on taking up a complaint in accordance with the statutes is because the FIH is heavily dependent and reliant on India/ Hockey India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice for the sport of hockey should prevail over money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The governance of the International Hockey Federation has a glorious past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These recent incidents will go down in the history of the sport of hockey as the darkest episode where you sold the soul of the sport for personal gains of an individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With every failed attempt to rationalise and justify the complaint against the President of the FIH, you are falling into a deep pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mittal had claimed that Batra breached FIH statutes when elected President of the global body in November 2016 as he was still the head of Hockey India.</p>
<p>Batra insisted Mittal had referenced a later edition of the FIH statutes and there was nothing in the regulations when he was voted in as President that prevented him from holding the role with Hockey India - a stance the FIH Integrity Unit agreed with.</p>
<p>Batra&rsquo;s current term as President of the FIH has been extended until May 2021 because the governing body was forced to postpone its Congress due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>When contacted by insidethegames, the FIH referred to a statement from Integrity Unit chairman Gordon Snell last week.</p>
<p>The FIH Integrity Unit &ldquo;decided that it will not be taking any action regarding FIH President Dr Batra in relation to this matter on the basis that the matter is not sustained&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, according to the FIH Statutes at the time, there was no requirement for Dr Batra to change his relationship with Hockey India after his election as FIH President in November 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He therefore committed no breach of the procedure or the FIH Statutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

<p><img src="https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IOA.jpg" alt="img">
The border clash between India and China at the Galwan valley could result in Indian Olympic Association (IOA) dropping Chinese products and sponsors. IOA secretary general Rajeev Mehta has said that the association is with the country and if the members feel it necessary to snap ties, the General House will take decision.

<p>The deal with Li-Ning was signed in May 2018 for supplying Indian athletes’ kits worth an estimated Rs 5 to 6 crore. Also Read - Army Chief Naravane to Visit Ladakh to Discuss Ground Situation, Plan Next Move</p>
<p>“We have an agreement with Li Ning till Tokyo Olympics as a kitting partner. But the country comes first and IOA is no different on this. If the members feel so the General House can take decision (to snap ties),” Mehta told PTI.</p>
<p>“IOA is with the country,” he added.</p>
<p>IOA treasurer Anandeshwar Pandey echoes Mehta’s views saying IOA should end the association with Li Ning respecting the anti-China sentiments prevalent in the country after 20 Indian soldiers died during the clash.</p>
<p>“According to me the IOA should end this association (with Li Ning) in line with the sentiments prevailing in the country,” Pandey said.</p>
<p>IOA General house comprises presidents and secretaries of the national sports federations (NSFs) besides chiefs and secretaries of state Olympic associations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BCCI has said it will reconsider deal with Chinese company Vivo which is the title sponsor of IPL but only for the next cycle.

New Delhi [India] June 22 (ANI): Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President Narinder Dhruv Batra on Monday urged the country&rsquo;s Olympic medalists and Olympians to lead the celebrations of Olympic Day on June 23, hoping that India transits from a sports-watching nation to more of an active sports-participating nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, June 23, is Olympic Day. In our own individual ways, we can celebrate the occasion and help India embark on a journey from a sports-watching nation to a more active sports-participating nation. It could be some form of physical activity or be by way of encouragement to Olympic sport,&rdquo; Batra said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I urge India&rsquo;s Olympic medalists and Olympians to lead the celebrations. The Olympic community can inspire every citizen to play any sport of their choice. The National Sports Federations and State Olympic Associations must not lag in encouraging athletes and support staff to participate in Olympic Day Activity. IOA would love to see all the NGOs supporting the sports ecosystem, members of the sports media, fans, sponsors and all other benefactors of Olympic sport to take part in the celebrations tomorrow,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Batra further urged to make the occasion &ldquo;throb with life&rdquo; in India and promote healthy lifestyles despite the prevailing situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can remind ourselves of the Olympic motto Citius-Altius-Fortius (meaning Faster-Higher-Stronger) to be in the pursuit of excellence. The values of Olympism - excellence, friendship and respect - are the foundation on which the Olympic Movement builds its activities to promote sport, culture and education with a view to building a better world,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make #OlympicDay throb with life in India, despite the circumstances caused by the Pandemic. We can promote healthy and active lifestyles in countless ways, even with social-distancing restrictions that are in place. We can return to celebrating the philosophy of sport with renewed vigour and determination. Yes, we can and must use the opportunity to enhance the awareness and importance of Olympic sport in our country,&rdquo; Batra concluded. (ANI)</p>

<p>A major scuffle has broken out in the(IOA). Vice presidenthas alleged that presidenthas been running the association as a “personal company”.Mittal alleged that Batra doesn’t follow the rules and regulations in place and has violated the IOA constitution.The vice president went on to write to the InternationalFederation (FIH) saying that Batra was ineligible to contest for the post of FIH president or IOA chief.However, the FIH Integrity Unit (FIU) declined to take any action against Batra.“Indeed, according to the FIH Statutes at the time (2016), there was no requirement for Dr Batra to change his relationship with Hockey India after his election as FIH President in November 2016. He therefore committed no breach of the procedure or the FIH Statutes,” read FIH’s statement.Nevertheless, Mittal is hell-bent on pushing for Batra&rsquo;s disqualification as IOA president. He has also approached the International Olympic Committee&rsquo;s Ethics Commission seeking a ban on Batra from “Hockey and the Olympic Movement”.Although some in the IOA claim that Mittal is looking to contest for the president’s post in next year’s elections, he vehemently denies it. “I have placed it on record in my letter to the IOC chief that I am not an aspirant for the presidentship of 2021,” he told an agency.Mittal claimed victory after the Delhi High Court stayed an order passed by Batra and opined that the order only points that Batra has been functioning in an “arbitrary manner”.&ldquo;I am so happy with the High Court verdict. His (Batra) madness has been stopped. It is a major reflection on Batra’s way of functioning where he has been acting illegally,” Mittal told the agency.As far as the FIU’s clean chit to Batra is concerned, Mittal blamed the FIH CEO Thierry Weil for the &ldquo;mischief&rdquo;. “My complaint should have gone to the independent Disciplinary Commission. But the FIH CEO sent it to the FIU. The CEO has been appointed by Batra. So, the CEO deliberately sent the complaint to FIU Commissioner,” Mittal alleged.
