<p>Amelia Love Clearheart</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has changed a lot about how we work lately, and it&rsquo;s no different for dance teachers like Amelia Love Clearheart. Clearheart, who lives in Seattle, has been teaching ballet and other types of dance for 15 years. Given the spread of the coronavirus, she&rsquo;s had to start doing her lessons online through streaming and prerecorded video. But her first lesson will be the most memorable thanks to a special guest appearance from her cat, Aurora.</p>
<p>Amelia Love Clearheart</p>
<p>Last week, Clearheart was trying to record a lesson for her Ballet 4 class, which is 10- to 14-year-old dancers. Clearheart is used to Aurora hanging out and weaving between her feet. &ldquo;Aurora and I move like that all day long. She walks through my feet all day long,&rdquo; Clearheart told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;We have a flawless flow.&rdquo; The video made its way online, and Aurora&rsquo;s final flourish makes the whole thing a little moment of joy.</p>
<p>The higher quality video that went viral of Aurora the cat and Amelia the ballet teacher, remote dance lessons with a surprise finish!</p>
<p>Clearheart said Aurora, whom she adopted a year and a half ago, has never leaped into her arms like that. But, she said, Aurora is a very attuned cat and just knew what was needed in the moment. &ldquo;That was all about her being awesome,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For me, this is about cats being cats, but it&rsquo;s also about humans having our needs met by animals. They’re saving people.&rdquo; Clearheart posted the video on her own Instagram and Facebook pages, but it really took off when her brother posted it to r/aww on Reddit, where it quickly reached the front page. And people are enjoying it because there&rsquo;s so much love in the video.</p>

By EUobserver</p>
<p>Belgian virologist Steven Van Gucht said during Friday&rsquo;s daily national coronavirus press conference that for the first time a cat was found infected by the coronavirus, Belgian national broadcaster VRT reports. He added that so far this is a isolated case. So far only three pets are known to be infected, two dogs in Hong Kong, and now one cat in Belgium.

<h3 id="caterpillar-cat-withdraws-guidance-on-coronavirus-concerns">Caterpillar (CAT) Withdraws Guidance on Coronavirus Concerns</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t92Gs3TrRC5VqsKiPIsbxw--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/dfbf477ce67e2ca9b1c9e4b00f36cf66" alt="img">
Caterpillar Inc. CAT recently withdrew its guidance for 2020 on account of the coronavirus outbreak. The company also announced that its supply chain has been disrupted owing to the coronavirus crisis. Further, it is temporarily suspending operations at certain facilities on account of weak demand and restrictions imposed by governments to contain the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>First detected in China, the coronavirus rapidly spread across the world and has been declared a pandemic. Per the World Health Organization’s situation report as of Mar 26, 2020, global affected coronavirus cases has shot up to 462,684, claiming 20,834 lives.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Impacted</p>
<p>Caterpillar stated that the coronavirus pandemic has impacted its supply chain. The company is monitoring the situation and supply chain teams have been executing business continuity plans. These options include, using alternative sources, air freight, rerouting orders to other distribution centers, while prioritizing the redistribution of the most impactful parts.</p>
<p>Few Facilities Suspended</p>
<p>Due to weak demand on account of uncertain economic conditions, potential supply constraints and government actions to curb the spread of the virus, Caterpillar is temporarily suspending operations at certain facilities. However, the company continues to run majority of its domestic operations and plans to continue operating in rest parts of the world, as permitted by local authorities. However, the company added that it may suspend operations at additional facilities if the situation warrants.</p>
<p>2020 Guidance Withdrawn</p>
<p>During its fourth-quarter 2019 conference call, Caterpillar had issued earnings per share guidance of $8.50-$1.00 for 2020. The mid-point of the guidance indicates a fall of 16% from the adjusted earnings per share of $11.06 reported in 2019. Caterpillar had then cautioned that end user demand would be down by about 4% to 9% thanks to the trade war tensions. Dealers were anticipated to reduce inventories by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, due to the ongoing global economic uncertainty. The company has now withdrawn this guidance, citing that the uncertainty of the impact of the outbreak on its financial and operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.</p>
<p>Taking Precautionary Measures</p>
<p>Caterpillar added that the company is taking all necessary steps to protect the safety, health and well-being of employees, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities. Preventive measures taken by the company include increased cleaning and disinfecting of facilities, advocating remote working when possible, restricting business travel, cancellation of certain events and limitations on visitor access to facilities and practicing social distancing.</p>
<p>Over the past year, shares of Caterpillar have plunged 16.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 22.9%.</p>
<p>The coronavirus outbreak has dealt a further blow to the manufacturing sector, which was already reeling under the protracted U.S.-China trade tensions and waning global demand. The U.S Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released by the Institute for Supply Management had been below 50 (indicating contraction) for five consecutive months till December 2019. Even though the index climbed to 50.9 in January and came in at 50.1 in February, it seems unlikely that this recovery will stay, considering that manufacturing has been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Factory closures across the globe, impact of the restrictions imposed by different governments, supply chain disruptions, low demand for goods, availability of employees and workers, logistic costs, among others will hit the sector.</p>
<p>There has been a spate of guidance withdrawals by the industry players lately. Terex Corporation TEX, another player in the manufacturing and construction industry withdrew its guidance for 2020 and announced that it has suspended all share repurchases. Earlier this week, agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer, Deere &amp; Company DE withdrew its financial outlook for 2020 citing the COVID-19 outbreak. Another farm equipment maker, AGCO followed suit and withdrew its financial guidance for the current year. Production has been suspended in many of the company’s European facilities, primarily due to supply-chain constrains and material shortage. Additional production disruptions in other regions are expected as well.</p>
<p>Zacks Rank &amp; a Stock to Consider</p>
<p>Caterpillar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p>
<p>A better-ranked stock in the Industrial Products sector is Sharps Compliance Corp SMED, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
<p>Sharps Compliance has an estimated earnings growth rate of 800% for 2020. In a year’s time, the company’s shares have gained 57%.</p>
<p>The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All</p>
<p>Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it&rsquo;s predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s first trillionaires,&rdquo; but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.</p>
