<p>Yohan, member of the TST K-pop group, has died. He was 28. KJ Entertainment, the band&rsquo;s record label, confirmed that the singer &ndash; whose real name was Kim Jeong-hwan &ndash; died on Monday, according to multiple reports. No cause of death was given at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are sad to relay the most unfortunate, sorrowful news,&rdquo; the label said in a statement given to The Guardian. &ldquo;On June 16, TST member Yohan left this world. The late Yohan’s family is currently in deep mourning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yohan&rsquo;s wake will be held at Severance Hospital in Sinchon, per multiple reports. He last posted on Instagram on May 31, writing, &ldquo;I want to go to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yohan began his K-pop career in 2013 as a member of NOM, also known as No Other Man. In 2017, he joined the six-piece group, TST.</p>
<p>The artist is tragically one of several K-pop stars fans have mourned in recent months. In October, Sulli, a former member of top girl group f(x), was found dead after being a target of abusive online comments and suffered from depression. A month later, Kara&rsquo;s Goo Hara was also found dead in her Seoul home. She was 28.</p>
<p>Fans of TST and Yohan have been taking to social media to express their condolences and share how much they adored him.</p>

<h3 id="k-pop-fans-are-becoming-an-unexpected-ally-to-george-floyd-protesters">&ldquo;K-Pop Fans Are Becoming an Unexpected Ally to George Floyd Protesters&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kpop-black-lives-matter-protests.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=1200&amp;h=628&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
(SEOUL, South Korea) — As American protesters took to the streets to mourn the death of George Floyd, they found an unexpected ally: K-pop fans.</p>
<p>Floyd died May 25 after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving. K-pop fans galvanized by police brutality and political disappointments swiftly mobilized, re-purposing their usual platforms and hashtags from boosting their favorite stars to backing the Black Lives Matter movement. They flooded right-wing hashtags and police apps with short video clips and memes of their K-pop stars.</p>
<p>Read more: How BTS Is Taking Over the World</p>
<p>In a tweet Thursday to its 26 million fans, South Korean boy band BTS said it opposes racial discrimination and violence and announced a $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter. Fans quickly followed suit with the hashtag #MatchAMillion on Twitter, matching the donation after 24 hours according to “One In An ARMY,” a global fundraising team made up of BTS fans.</p>
<p>Even so, political activism isn’t exactly associated with K-pop fans. Over the years, K-pop fans have gained notoriety for overtaking Twitter trends and Instagram feeds. The loose network of fans mobilizes in a heartbeat — usually to promote new songs from their favorite K-pop artists or to put down their critics. That same social media energy is being repurposed to support the Black Lives Matter movement, and BTS fans, known as ARMY, are at the forefront.</p>
<p>Chloë Gallot, a French university student, said she joined ARMY — Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth — earlier this year when she “fell into the rabbit hole” while searching for a distraction from the coronavirus outbreak and personal troubles. A few days ago, Gallot became one of the ARMY members to respond to the #MatchAMillion hashtag, donating around $90 to Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>“[BTS] are pushing us to use our platforms even more.” Gallot told The Associated Press, adding that BTS fans, including herself, had already started fundraising before BTS’ donation was made public.</p>
<p>K-pop experts say zealous activism is nothing new for the fans.</p>
<p>“Despite the stereotypes about boy band fans, they are known for being politically aware and helping raise money for charitable causes online, especially on Twitter,” said Hyun-su Yim, K-pop reporter at the Korea Herald. “Which is why it took many people by surprise when the fandom spearheaded efforts to drown out racist hashtags,” Yim said, referring to K-pop fandoms clogging up U.S. police apps and flooding racist hashtags with their favorite K-pop memes and fancies, rendering them useless.</p>

<p>Although K-pop has been popular in Asia for decades, the rise of BTS around the mid-2010s has grown fans in all corners of the world. However, that global expansion has sometimes created tension within the industry, spurred by multiple factors including language and cultural differences.</p>
<p>Korean artists and labels have been thrust into uncharted territories where they’re forced to take a stance on social issues, drawing criticism from fans who say some issues are too far-removed from their own backyards.</p>
<p>Danny Kim, who runs “DKDKTV,” a popular YouTube channel on all things K-pop, points out that Korean celebrities are not known to be vocal about social issues. “The general perception of a celebrity is ‘he’s not there to voice his opinion — he’s there to for the enjoyment of the people,’” Kim said. He also said K-pop stars are often bound by legal contracts, keeping them from making remarks that could come cause friction.</p>
<p>Joseph Dorsey, a black fan from Chicago, said he wants K-pop artists to support the Black Lives Matter movement because the music industry has long benefited from adopting “black American music and black American culture.”</p>
<p>Kim thinks it’s time for K-pop stars to speak themselves.</p>
<p>“K-pop has become not strictly a Korean thing anymore.”</p>

<h3 id="k-pop-fans-are-taking-over-white-lives-matter-and-other-anti-black-hashtags-with-memes-and-fancams-of-their-favorite-stars">&ldquo;K-pop fans are taking over &lsquo;White Lives Matter&rsquo; and other anti-Black hashtags with memes and fancams of their favorite stars&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200604140521-01-k-pop-bts-fans-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) If there&rsquo;s one rule on social media that people can agree on, it&rsquo;s this: Don&rsquo;t cross K-pop stans. With tens of thousands of K-pop fan accounts posting over six billion tweets last year, they have become one of the strongest forces on social media.</p>
<p>Now, following George Floyd&rsquo;s death , K-pop fans are using their power on the internet to rally around the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>Floyd, 46, died last week in police custody after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest. His death has sparked nationwide and international protests.</p>
<p>Hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #BlackoutTuesday have been trending on social media as Americans demand justice for Floyd. But many who oppose the BLM movement have been countering those hashtags with their own, such as #WhiteoutWednesday.</p>
<p>So K-pop fans did what they do best: Post countless memes and videos of their favorite groups, this time using the anti-black hasthtags to drown out those voices.

<h3 id="k-pop-fans-emerge-as-a-powerful-force-in-us-protests">&ldquo;K-pop fans emerge as a powerful force in US protests&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2E60/production/_112827811_getty_kpopblm.jpg" alt="img">
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption K-pop artists' and fans' support for the Black Lives Matter movement has attracted attention</p>
<p>Amid ongoing protests in America against racism and police brutality, a global legion of K-pop fans has emerged as an important ally for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.</p>
<p>Fans of South Korea&rsquo;s popular music industry have raised funds for BLM and mobilised to overload social media hashtags used by its opponents, earning appreciation from protesters for their political activism.</p>
<p>Some may have been surprised by their impact, but K-pop observers note fans have long organised support for social and political causes as well as their favourite artists.</p>
<p>This support has, however, also raised questions about systemic racism in the industry and fandom, leading to calls for K-pop to address its own complicated relationship with race.</p>
<p>Fancams to the rescue</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of protests in the US, sparked by the death of black man George Floyd, the Dallas Police Department asked people to share videos of &ldquo;illegal activity protests&rdquo; through the iWatch Dallas app.</p>
<p>K-pop fans worldwide responded by inundating it with fan-recorded videos, known as fancams, and memes of various K-pop artists, in an effort to prevent police from tracking protesters' actions.</p>
<p>Barely a day later, the app was reported to be experiencing technical difficulties though Dallas Police would not say if it was due to the fancams.</p>
<p>K-pop fans also spammed hashtags used to oppose BLM on social media, such as #AllLivesMatter, #BlueLivesMatter and #WhiteLivesMatter.</p>
<p>Though this made such hashtags trend higher, it also made it harder for their original messages to be seen.</p>
<p>K-pop fans, who have previously been derided online and criticised for &ldquo;fancam spam&rdquo;, were celebrated as valued allies of the protestors.</p>
<p>See also:</p>
<p>Many K-pop artists voiced their support for the movement on Twitter and Instagram, and some donated to the cause.</p>
<p>When popular boy band BTS announced a $1m (£784,000) donation, fan group One In An Army (OIAA) organised its own fundraising drive and matched the amount in less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>History of political activism</p>
<p>To many outside K-pop fandom, this political activism and co-ordination was a surprise.</p>
<p>However, those who follow K-pop closely consider such fans' organisation and impact perfectly natural.</p>
<p>Fans in South Korea and worldwide routinely run well-co-ordinated campaigns to promote their favourite artists and propel them to awards and charts success and greater visibility. These skills are now being applied to the BLM cause.</p>
<p>As Hyunsu Yim, a pop culture reporter for The Korea Herald, has noted in a Twitter thread, this is far from the first time K-pop fans have made a political or social impression.</p>
<p>He illustrated his point with previous examples of activism: donations to a London charity to fund over 35,000 meals; calls for safer roads in Bangladesh; and Chile&rsquo;s government in 2019 blaming K-pop and other &ldquo;international influences and media&rdquo; for domestic protests.</p>
<p>K-pop and racism</p>
<p>But while many have praised K-pop fans for their involvement in the protests, some are highlighting the longstanding abuse and harassment of black fans, many of whom have left fandoms as a result.</p>
<p>Hashtags like #BlackARMYSMatter and #BlackARMYSEquality trended on Twitter in 2018 after black members of the BTS ARMY complained of racism within the fandom. Fans of other artists have also complained of racism in their communities.</p>
<p>Observers also question why K-pop idols - many of whom have expressed support for the US protests - are often silent when it comes to discrimination in South Korea.</p>
<p>This may partly be to avoid a backlash from their more conservative fans.</p>
<p>Many female idols have been criticised for expressing feminist views, and many who speak up for LGBTQ rights abroad shy away from such issues at home.</p>
<p>Agencies may also exercise control over what the performers say.</p>
<p>After Denise Kim, a member of rookie girl group Secret Number, expressed her support for BLM on Instagram, her Instagram and SoundCloud accounts were deleted and her agency&rsquo;s Instagram account deleted its latest photo of her.</p>
<p>Fans criticised Kim&rsquo;s agency and are now increasingly voicing their outrage about such censorship, as well as calling out idols for hypocrisy.</p>
<p>When Amber Liu, a member of girl group f(x), called for George Floyd&rsquo;s killer to be charged with first-degree murder, some pointed out that in 2019 she said that a black man - seen being harassed and arrested in a viral video - &ldquo;deserved it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For K-pop, a multi-genre industry heavily influenced by black culture and music, the Black Lives Matter movement has highlighted the need for artists and fans to do some soul-searching.</p>
<p>But as these protests have shown, their impact on society cannot be underestimated. When harnessed for a cause, K-pop has the potential to make a difference.

K-pop stans have recently come into the digital spotlight after leading efforts online to spam a police app with fancams and flood hashtags on Twitter and Instagram in order to drown out racist posts.</p>
<p>The actions stans have taken amid Black Lives Matter are built on a fandom history of digitally organizing around trending hashtags or leading charity campaigns for non-profits.</p>
<p>While the majority of the attention the K-pop fandom has experienced recently has been positive, it fails to address the racism that Black fans still face in the community.</p>

<p>In the wake of George Floyd&rsquo;s killing and amid Black Lives Matter protests, there&rsquo;s been a paradigm shift in the perception of K-pop stans online. While locals (non-stans) have typically had an adversarial relationship with K-pop fandom in the past, recent events have shaken that relationship up.</p>
<p>K-pop stans have made their presence known across the US and around the world. They spammed a police app with fancams, took over hashtags on Twitter and Instagram in an effort to drown out racist posts, worked to stop their own hashtags from trending out of respect for #BlackLivesMatter, and in the case of BTS' ARMY, matched the group&rsquo;s $1 million Black Lives Matter donation in approximately a day.</p>
<p>Reactions to those events typically bore a tone of shock or surprise, with Twitter users later using the #kpopstans hashtag to express appreciation or to alert stans of another hashtag. As MIT Technology Review&rsquo;s Abby Ohlheiser noted, &ldquo;Online culture loves a vigilante in times of crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Previously, locals have complained about fancams (short fandom-focused videos or edits) and argued that stans are too quick to start cancelation hashtags. Now, fancams are a good thing and K-pop stans are being praised by celebrities like Keke Palmer and Jordan Peele.</p>
<p>While the public&rsquo;s change of heart around K-pop stans may come as a surprise, what doesn&rsquo;t is the fact that K-pop stans were able to mobilize so quickly. Modern K-pop fandom, after a decade of leveraging social media as a way to bring awareness to artists and using fandom organizing to raise money for worldwide causes, is built around digital organization on a massive scale.</p>
<p>K-pop stans have a history of organizing digital campaigns</p>
<p>K-pop fans have a long history of mobilizing around projects related to their artists, and that&rsquo;s part of what makes quick, collective action so possible. K-pop fans are well-accustomed to trending hashtags around new releases, and they&rsquo;re quick to respond to new content: for instance, BTS released a new music video on June 11 for the song &ldquo;We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal.&rdquo; Within an hour, ARMY (BTS fans) were trending #WeAreBulletproofTheEternal to celebrate the new release.</p>
<p>Even if K-pop fans sometimes trend a hashtag or keyword on Twitter without intending to (this happens frequently), fans work to trend things on purpose plenty of the time as well, sometimes voting and deliberately choosing when and how to trend tags for birthdays, music drops, or other events.</p>
<p>Fanbases of individual groups publicize voting campaigns to their significant followings on Twitter that typically number in the thousands; many fandoms focus on voting for idols on Korean music shows so that they can notch their first coveted music show win, a major signifier of success.</p>
<p>Post-&ldquo;Gangnam Style,&rdquo; PSY&rsquo;s breakthrough 2012 hit that brought Korean pop music into the US mainstream, fans turned towards platforms like YouTube and Twitter primarily to try and increase K-pop&rsquo;s visibility online, said Michelle Cho, a professor of East Asian popular cultures at the University of Toronto who specializes in Korean film, media, and the Korean wave. Cho also recently spoke with MIT Technology Review.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[K-pop fans] have developed a certain kind of repertoire and skills on how to use social media platforms to bring things to prominence,&rdquo; Cho told Insider. &ldquo;I think that the K-pop fandom over time has developed an awareness that they can have influence in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recent works of so-called &ldquo;fancam activism,&rdquo; like flooding hashtags like #whitelivesmatter with videos of dancing K-pop idols, was possible because K-pop stans were able to leverage the stability of pre-existing fandom networks in order to coordinate to take over tags (it&rsquo;s worth noting that K-pop stans have a reputation on local Twitter for starting or commandeering #isoverparty hashtags).</p>
<p>Furthermore, through engaging in public acts like disrupting racist posts on social platforms, stans also stand to change public opinion of the fandom itself. Boy band fandoms have been denigrated in frequently sexist ways since the Beatles era, but Cho says that K-pop fans could present themselves in a different light, as a group of &ldquo;diverse, politically progressive, social media savvy people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BTS fans matching the band&rsquo;s $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter relied on previous fandom systems</p>
<p>One of the most compelling events in K-pop fans' wave of digital activism was a massive fundraising campaign by BTS' ARMY in an effort to match the group&rsquo;s million-dollar donation to Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>The campaign was successful — just a day after Variety reported BTS' contribution, ARMY managed to collectively raise the same amount, splitting donations across organizations like Reclaim the Block, the NAACP, and Black Lives Matter. One in an ARMY, (OIAA) a volunteer collective of BTS fans who have been organizing monthly charity projects since 2018, tracked the donations through a split donation page on ActBlue.</p>
<p>Erika Overton, who does outreach and communications for OIAA, told Insider that the group typically plans out its charity projects months in advance in order to liaise with non-profits and prepare campaign materials. That model doesn&rsquo;t allow for quick responses to crisis events — in those cases, OIAA typically compiles threads of resources for ARMYs who want to help.</p>
<p>—One in an ARMY⁷ Charity Project 💜 (@OneInAnARMY) June 1, 2020</p>
<p>On June 1, OIAA put out a Carrd website listing donation pages for non-profits as well as the split donation page that became the lynchpin of the #MatchAMillion campaign. Overton said that ARMYs had donated upwards of $50,000 before news of BTS' donation broke on June 6. After ARMY decided to try to match it and settled on the #MatchAMillion hashtag, the Carrd began to circulate widely and donations began to climb into the hundred-thousands.</p>
<p>The donation match was possible due to existing fandom structures like One in an ARMY. However, just as OIAA itself originated from a group of ARMYs wanting to leverage the fandom&rsquo;s power to raise money for Syrian relief in 2018, the #MatchAMillion campaign started with ARMYs calling on each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These kinds of things are not usual,&rdquo; Overton said. &ldquo;But when BTS themselves actually make a statement… that&rsquo;s like pouring rocket fuel on a fire that&rsquo;s already burning. So when they did their donation, [ARMY] was like, heck yeah, we&rsquo;re doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>K-pop fandoms, however, are still full of anti-Blackness</p>
<p>Recent attention regarding ARMY&rsquo;s donation match or the fancam activism has largely referenced &ldquo;K-pop stans&rdquo; as if they were a homogenous group, rather than a diverse set of people who vary in terms of race, age, country of origin, gender, and political beliefs. Flattening the broad fandom into a singular force fails to account for the racism that Black K-pop stans face.</p>
<p>Most recently, BigHit Entertainment and BTS' Suga apologized for using a sample of cult leader Jim Jones, who was responsible for the death of hundreds of his followers, many of whom were Black. Prior to the apology, and the removal of the sample from the track, some Black fans who had raised concerns over the sample were harassed and labeled as &ldquo;antis&rdquo; attempting to defame Suga&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>Cho says that these kinds of situations are how anti-Blackness frequently manifests in K-pop fandoms: some Black K-pop fans will call out an idol for cultural appropriation, blackface, or any other anti-Black action, and fans of an idol or group will become defensive and angry at those who leveled the criticism. &ldquo;The reason why some fans don&rsquo;t see that as an expression of systemic racism is that they really feel like, &lsquo;No, we&rsquo;re just defending our individual idol against these unfair attacks,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Black fans are sometimes left out of the conversation when it comes to anti-racist efforts</p>
<p>Black fans have been left out of much of the conversation about K-pop fandom&rsquo;s recent viral anti-racism efforts, said Ellie Forte, a 19-year-old Black K-pop stan who goes by @nctbussyy on Twitter and primarily follows SM Entertainment groups. &ldquo;When it came to talking about, &lsquo;Oh, K-pop fans are revolutionary, they&rsquo;re combatting racism,&rsquo; what people forgot about a lot was that Black stans were the ones who were really bringing up awareness about George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellie said that Black fans&rsquo; voices are silenced in K-pop fandom, most recently when she saw K-pop fans continuing to spread videos of George Floyd&rsquo;s death, especially without trigger warnings, despite Black fans asking them to stop doing so. She said that she&rsquo;s also seen pushback against Black fans who call on idols to speak up about Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>De&rsquo;Andra, a 23-year-old Black K-pop stan who goes by @tytaped on Twitter and preferred to not use her last name, said that she has seen Black fans harassed and doxxed for speaking up about idols' actions in addition to seeing K-pop accounts pretending to be Black, using AAVE (African American Vernacular English), and weighing in on issues &ldquo;as a &lsquo;Black&rsquo; person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain efforts by groups of K-pop stans can also have effects other than those intended. De&rsquo;Andra said that while she thought that spamming the Dallas police app and hashtags used to attempt to identify protesters were clever, she didn&rsquo;t like how the tactic was applied to hashtags like #whitelivesmatter because they ended up trending higher than they had been previously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[The trending hashtags] triggered a lot of black people actually. Sometimes, we don&rsquo;t realize how counterproductive our actions can be,&rdquo; Ellie said. &ldquo;I may see it as counterproductive, but another Black person may see it as, &lsquo;Oh my gosh, this was great because I don&rsquo;t have to see racist posts.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Black fans feel that idols have a responsibility to speak up</p>
<p>As The Atlantic&rsquo;s Kaitlyn Tiffany wrote, many K-pop stans were taking action to support protests even before their favorite idols spoke up. Still though, idols speaking up does make a difference — while some BTS fans were already donating and working to support Black Lives Matter long before BTS spoke out in support on June 4 or their donation was made public, the group&rsquo;s action indubitably spurred the fandom into re-action with the donation campaign.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, idols speaking out does matter to some Black fans, particularly given the extent to which K-pop draws on Black culture. In an op-ed for Teen Vogue, Natasha Mulenga argued that K-pop artists should keep speaking up about Black Lives Matter due to K-pop&rsquo;s roots in and reliance on Black culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking now more than ever when I hear [K-pop artists] say that they care about and appreciate the support of all their fans if I am included in this, if Black people are included in this,&rdquo; De&rsquo;Andra said.</p>
<p>Ellie, along with other Black K-pop fans including De&rsquo;Andra, @DavonnaDarling, and @BlaxSeoul, organized a hashtag project for June 12 calling on SM Entertainment, one of South Korea&rsquo;s major entertainment companies, to use its platform to &ldquo;stand in solidarity with Black people in our fight for racial and social equality in all areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>—FUCK THE COPS (@nctbussyy) June 10, 2020</p>
<p>Early in the morning on June 12, people began to use the hashtags #SMBLACKOUT and #SMUseYourPlatform to call on SM Entertainment to speak out, with some expressing that they wouldn&rsquo;t support the company until they did so. While some SM Entertainment idols like NCT&rsquo;s Johnny and Red Velvet&rsquo;s Yeri have spoken out on social media, SM Entertainment has not made a public statement.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ellie said that it&rsquo;s important to listen to Black fans and include them in conversations about K-pop fandom. However, she said that anti-Blackness is far from exclusive to K-pop stan spaces online: &ldquo;Even though Black K-pop stans are finding themselves stuck in this anti-Black fandom, they can&rsquo;t go anywhere else because every fandom has anti-Blackness in it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Black fans, no matter where they go, don&rsquo;t have those safe spaces really to just be themselves.&rdquo;

<h3 id="k-pop-stans-are-using-short-videos-called-fancams-to-drown-out-racists-online-this-is-how-the-movement-started">&ldquo;K-pop stans are using short videos called fancams to drown out racists online. This is how the movement started.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5ed8769c3f737044dc553904?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Fancams, short videos celebrating K-pop idols, recently came into mainstream awareness when stans flooded racist hashtags like #whitelivesmatter with videos of dancing idols.</p>
<p>Fancams on platforms like Twitter have expanded past K-pop fandom, with stans of all varieties making short video edits that circulate on social media.</p>
<p>The short videos are used sometimes to promote artists or derail conversation, and have become memes in their own right.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>On June 3, several trending hashtags seemed to bear a somewhat misplaced categorization. Amid ongoing Black Lives Matter protests around the world following the death of George Floyd, who was killed in police custody, three hashtags — #whitelivesmatter, #whiteoutwednesday, and #BlueLivesMatter — were trending under the &ldquo;kpop&rdquo; label on Twitter.</p>
<p>Multiple seemingly unrelated hashtags trended under &ldquo;kpop&rdquo; on June 3. Twitter</p>
<p>The hashtags weren&rsquo;t trending due to a massive influx of sincere posts. Rather, they had been hijacked by K-pop stans who were spamming them with fancams and memes, drowning out any racist posts or rhetoric that may have been taking place.</p>
<p>Fancams — short videos typically depicting K-pop idols performing — have never been more popular, although they&rsquo;ve regularly drawn the ire of Twitter users irritated with seeing dancing idols in cancel culture hashtags or under unrelated tweets. However, fancam culture has developed strongly over the past half-decade as stan Twitter has adopted short, flashy videos as a means of signaling fandom allegiance and commandeering hashtags.</p>
<p>Fancams originated in K-pop fandom, but the term has come to encapsulate other short videos and edits</p>
<p>While the term &ldquo;fancam&rdquo; has come to signify a broad range of performance videos, edits, and generally short videos wielded by stans of all variations on social media, the term is most closely tied to K-pop fandom. Until recently, &ldquo;fancam&rdquo; typically referred to a performance video focused on a specific idol in a K-pop group, although it could also signify video of an idol at a fansign (fan meeting event), an airport, or elsewhere in public.</p>
<p>Recorded by fans, fansites (&ldquo;professional fans&rdquo; of sorts who regularly take photos and videos of artists), and occasionally television channels, K-pop fancams are frequently presented in a vertical format, making them perfect for sharing and consuming on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Within the past year, fancams have come to signify more than just K-pop content, however. The term, now widely used across stan Twitter regardless of fandom, could just as easily mean an edit set to TikTok-esque tunes like Flo Millie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beef FloMix&rdquo; — &ldquo;I like cash and my hair to my ass!&rdquo; — featuring people like &ldquo;Parasite&rdquo; actor Cho Yeo-jeong.</p>
<p>A viral fancam from 2014 arguably set modern fancam culture in motion</p>
<p>In 2014, a fancam of Hani, a member of girl group EXID, performing the group&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Up &amp; Down&rdquo; went viral. Posted on YouTube in October by user pharkil, the video of Hani&rsquo;s performance went took off sometime in November, per Seoulbeats.</p>
<p>Prior to the viral video, &ldquo;Up &amp; Down&rdquo; hadn&rsquo;t charted very well on South Korea&rsquo;s Gaon chart, falling out of the top 100 within a week of entry. After the fancam, however, &ldquo;Up &amp; Down&rdquo; began to chart again in South Korea. EXID started to promote the song again on music shows, eventually notching the group&rsquo;s first music show win, which can make or break a K-pop group. The original Hani fancam on YouTube currently has nearly 32 million views.</p>
<p>The success of Hani&rsquo;s &ldquo;Up &amp; Down&rdquo; set in motion what eventually became the fancam culture we know today, where videos of idols hold not only viral potential, but also social currency on platforms like Twitter.</p>
<p>Early fancam culture saw videos attached to tweets like flashy punctuation</p>
<p>In the late 2010s, K-pop fans on Twitter began to tack fancams onto tweets, whether they were talking about an idol performing, sending off a snappy reply, or just tweeting.</p>
<p>Attaching a fancam to a tweet served a few purposes at the time: first, it was a clear way to flex fandom affiliation. In that respect, posting a fancam also allows for the promotion of a member of a group or a specific performance.</p>
<p>Fancams have also served as a way to derail discourse</p>
<p>As Sage Anderson reported in Mashable in July 2019, fancams have sometimes also been used to &ldquo;derail actual critiques and even constructive discourse,&rdquo; particularly when stans spam fancams in posts or hashtags that aren&rsquo;t even related to their group or K-pop.</p>
<p>Over time, fancams became a staple in cancel culture tags and Twitter users started to expect any #isoverparty hashtag to be rife with fancams and K-pop stans either participating in the cancelation at hand or promoting their faves.</p>
<p>Of course, the promotion aspect still plays into fancam usage even in cancel tags. When a celebrity or public figure gets propped up for cancelation on Twitter, there&rsquo;s typically a chorus of, &ldquo;well, maybe if you stanned [insert artist]&rdquo; or something along the lines of &ldquo;flop, anyways stan [artist].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;maybe if you stanned&rdquo; and &ldquo;stan [artist]&rdquo; language was arguably popularized by K-pop memes like &ldquo;stan Loona,&rdquo; in which Loona fans aggressively promoted the group under popular tweets, no matter if they were related to Loona or not. Used as early as Sep. 2016, the phrase gained traction in late 2017 as Loona stans began to reply to tweets with Loona videos in order to promote the group.</p>
<p>This kind of derailing fancam usage is in large part why locals on Twitter typically express annoyance with fancams and K-pop fandom in general.</p>
<p>—Elvis The Alien (@ElvisTheAlienTV) October 8, 2019</p>
<p>Fancams have become so pervasive that they&rsquo;re a meme in their own right</p>
<p>As fancams began to take root outside of K-pop fandom, people began to make edits of characters — typically featuring tunes like the aforementioned &ldquo;Beef FloMix&rdquo; or other viral hits like Megan Thee Stallions &ldquo;Savage&rdquo; — that typically wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten the fancam treatment. That lead to the &ldquo;f-ck it, [person/character/etc.] fancam&rdquo; trend.</p>
<p>—revenge slut 📌 1312 (@allyourpillz) May 31, 2020</p>
<p>Sometimes, individual fancams become memes in their own right. A good example is one fancam of BTS member Suga performing &ldquo;Seesaw:&rdquo; while uploads of the fancam appear to have been deleted or lost multiple times on Twitter after racking up millions of views, the video of Suga performing the song in a sparkling red suit is instantly recognizable.</p>
<p>—candice⁷ CHARITY COMMISSIONS EMAIL ME📌 (@qarameiio) June 2, 2020</p>
<p>Of course, with great memetic resonance also comes the potential for bait-and-switches: recently, K-pop fans have been organizing to identify certain videos (and the users that post them) that begin as fancams but cut over to gory or otherwise disturbing footage in what&rsquo;s come to be known as the #fancamsituation.</p>
<p>Recently, fancams have come into the spotlight amid recent Black Lives Matter protests</p>
<p>K-pop fans have always been a force to be reckoned with online: they relentlessly stream their faves&rsquo; music, work to trend hashtags in order to bring attention to new releases, and organize voting campaigns for South Korean music shows or American awards like Billboard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Top Social Artist.&rdquo; In recent crusades, however, many K-pop stans have come together, regardless of individual fandom, to do what they do best: spam fancams on the timeline.</p>
<p>K-pop stans have recently made headlines amid ongoing Black Lives Matter protests for wielding fancams online in order to try to protect protesters' identities and drown out racist posts.</p>
<p>After the Dallas Police Department put out a call for people to submit video of &ldquo;illegal activity from protests&rdquo; via its iWatch Dallas app, K-pop stans called on each other to flood the app with fancams in order to make it difficult for officers to sift through submissions to the app. Soon after, the app experienced an interruption in service, although the Dallas Police Department told Insider in a statement that the cause of the temporary interruption was unknown.</p>
<p>On June 2 and 3, K-pop fans hijacked hashtags like #whitelivesmatter, #whiteoutwednesday, and #BlueLivesMatter on Twitter and Instagram, filling them with fancams and causing them to trend on Twitter with each listed under the &ldquo;kpop&rdquo; category for at least a little bit.</p>
<p>At this point, it seems that the Twitter public&rsquo;s opinion on fancams (and in turn, K-pop stans), is beginning to shift from annoyance to begrudging respect. Ultimately, it is kind of funny that videos of dancing idols have become part of drowning out racist rhetoric in digital forums like Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>K-pop stans are so readily able to call on a treasure trove of fancams to flood hashtags and police apps because of the way that the trend has developed over the past several years of online fandom. Fancams are only part of stan Twitter&rsquo;s ability to organize, but their recent use builds off of years of stans using them as a means of diverting discussion and flooding online spaces with promotional content.

Psst! AsiaOne is on Telegram! Tell your friends!</p>
<p>From 17-step beauty regimes to squatting over a hot steam bath to er, cleansing out your lady bits, there is a reason (or rather, many reasons) why Korean women have that poreless, flawless skin we all covet – sheer dedication.</p>
<p>Check out these tips by 12 of your favourite K-stars, and pat, prime and soothe your way to #wokeuplikethis skin.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jessica Jung: Heat it up</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CAZ2_Y4nrIe/?utm_source=ig_embed[/embed]</p>
<p>Glowing skin that looks poreless – Jessica Jung achieves her skin perfection by “heating” up her skincare products after application to encourage absorption.</p>
<p>Just rub your palms together to generate a little heat and hold over your face without touching your skin.</p>
<p>How this works is that your body heat opens up your pores slightly and makes your skin cells more receptive and responsive to your beauty products.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Song Ji-Eun: Hydrate</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CAcUhoYnQdG/?utm_source=ig_embed[/embed]</p>
<p>As a singer, Song Ji-Eun understands the importance of drinking water in order to keep her vocal cords hydrated, but she also emphasises hydration in her skincare regime.</p>
<p>She drinks up to four litres a day and cites it as the secret behind her glistening, radiant skin.</p>
<p>Water helps to flush away the toxins in your body, and as your body is made of about 60per cent water, it is crucial in maintaining healthy skin function and oil-to-water balance.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Song Joong-Ki: Milk it for all it’s worth</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CBAthB3pDLq/?utm_source=ig_embed[/embed]</p>
<p>Literally. The Descendant of the Sun actor owes his enviably smooth and fair complexion to his nightly routine of washing his face with milk.</p>
<p>While it might sound a little strange, think about the last time you had a milk bath at the spa – didn’t your skin feel luxuriously smooth after?</p>
<p>Some dermatologists even recommend it, as milk reportedly helps to remove oil-soluble impurities with the help of the fat-soluble enzyme lipase and protein-based impurities and dead skin cells with lactic acid.</p>
<p>It also great for soothing sunburns and calming skin, but be sure to use raw or unpasteurized milk.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Irene Kim: Banish zits</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/ireneisgood/?utm_source=ig_embed[/embed]</p>
<p>Pimples are just the worst, but this is especially so for models.</p>
<p>Irene Kim shares this helpful hack for those annoying zits that appear right before an important event: blast hot water to steam up your shower, and soak a cotton pad with some toner and apply directly onto your breakouts.</p>
<p>The steam opens up your pores and allows the properties of your toner to absorb better.</p>
<p>For this tip, look for toners that contain ingredients like witch hazel or tea tree oil as they are known to help reduce inflammation.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Ha Ji-won: Moisturise, moisturise, moisturise</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B_tcBT7HSwZ/?utm_source=ig_embed[/embed]</p>
<p>For popular actress Ha Ji-won, nothing is more important that moisturising.</p>
<p>She values it above all other skincare tips, and ensures her skin does not stay dry for more than three seconds.</p>
<p>After washing her face, she immediately applies a jelly pack (from her skincare line J-One) to restore moisture lost during cleansing.</p>
<p>She is so strict about this that she recommends always having a facial mist within reach if your skincare products are away from your shower.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Song Hye-Kyo: DIY perfection</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B_jKogMlZJL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]</p>
<p>Actress Song Hye-Kyo is all about DIY masks, despite endorsing one of the biggest K-beauty brands. Her favourite recipe is a simple blend of egg whites and honey (ideally an active honey), applied fortnightly.</p>
<p>Simply massage onto your skin until dry, and rinse off with warm water.</p>
<p>Honey is a natural antibacterial agent and is great for acne treatment and prevention, and is also chock-full of antioxidants and moisturising properties which help to slow down signs of aging and visibly plump your skin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, egg whites help to shrink your pores by tightening the skin – the perfect mask, in our opinion.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>V (Kim Tae-Hyung): Travel smart</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B_svv2oJaCc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]</p>
<p>Member of popular boy band group BTS is no stranger to skin complaints (who says men don’t take care of their skin), and is particularly concerned about the elasticity of his skin.</p>
<p>A frequent traveler, he recommends dampening cotton pads with toner and double moisturising to avoid losing too much moisture and arriving at your destination with beautiful, glowing skin.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Pony: Green tea wash</li>
</ol>
<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CApJTfJHtG8/?utm_source=ig_embed[/embed]</p>
<p>She is one of Korea’s most famous beauty gurus, with over a whopping three million subscribers on Youtube, so you can be sure any tips from Pony are 100 per cent legit.</p>
<p>She swears by washing her face with green tea water, made by soaking bags of green tea in warm water.</p>
<p>Green tea has an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin that can help to reduce redness and puffiness.</p>
<p>Pony recommends doing this twice a week for best results.</p>

<p>Actress, singer and all-round idol Bae Suzy owes her glowing skin to what she dubs as the “424” method, which entails four minutes of rubbing a cleansing oil over her face to remove make up, followed by two minutes with a foaming cleanser and a final four minutes of with water.</p>
<p>Also known as ‘double cleansing’, this method ensures you’ve truly removed all traces of makeup and dirt that have accumulated over the course of a day, which provides the foundation for flawless skin and drastically reduces the chances of breakouts.</p>

<li>Go Hyun-Jung: Cleanse smart</li>

<p>Are you cleansing your skin the smart way?</p>
<p>According to actress Go Hyun-Jung (whose skin looks positively radiant despite her hectic schedule), she recommends cleansing the T-zone area first, followed by your cheeks.</p>
<p>This is because the former area tends to be oilier than the latter, and by cleansing your cheeks last, you ensure the drier areas are not exposed to cleanser for too long.</p>
<p>Over-cleansing = drier skin = more sensitive skin that has been stripped of its moisture, which makes your skin compensate by producing more oil. You do the math.</p>

<p>Krystal tells us in a previous interview, “The most important thing for me is to remove all the makeup completely before I go to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put on a lot of moisturising cream before I go to bed. That’s how I take care of my skin – nothing special.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never skip removing my makeup. Never! It’s really important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[And] I always ensure I drink a lot of water and work out as much as I can.”</p>

<p>Everyone has different skin types on different days, and Son Ye Jin understands this very well.</p>
<p>The Korean actress told us, “I believe there’s no one product that fits everyone or serves their skin concerns and purposes, so I try to allocate which products to use for when my skin is sensitive or dry, etc.”</p>
