<p>What’s your beauty pamper ritual?</p>
<p>My beauty pamper is simple. Every morning, I wash my face and apply moisturiser. My night ritual includes applying a sheet mask, a clay mask or my green tea sleeping mask.</p>
<p>Describe your personal style.</p>
<p>My personal style is comfortable and laidback. I look best in whatever I’m comfortable in. Even when I experiment, I always look for comfort. If I’m not comfortable I’ll keep fidgeting. Comfort comes first for me.</p>
<p>Ever had a beauty emergency before a big event / shoot? How did you deal with it?</p>
<p>It was the trailer launch of my first movie Dabangg 3. I didn’t have my outfit ready until an hour before the event. I ended up calling my friend’s mother, who’s a designer. Luckily, she had this pretty, pink outfit ready, which I finally wore. (Smiles) I looked pretty.</p>
<p>Do you follow any detox or cleansing diets?</p>
<p>I don’t follow any detox or cleansing diets, as such. My daily lifestyle consists of eating healthy, mainly ghar ka khana. A detox or cleanse happens for me every Tuesday because I eat only fruits that day. I’ve been doing it since I was young.</p>
<p>Who’s your go-to designer and why?</p>
<p>My go-to designer is Ashley Rebello. He knows exactly what looks good on me and what I’d be comfortable in. He’s sweet and I love working with him.</p>
<p>One styling hack that has changed your life&hellip;</p>
<p>I learnt to start visualising a whole outfit together. Earlier, I’d pick up random separates and pair them together. But now that I’ve started working with stylists, I like how they plan an outfit from head to toe.</p>
<p>A make-up hack you learned on the job?</p>
<p>Applying blush on my ears to make my face look softer overall.</p>
<p>A RED-CARPET fashion choice you regret…</p>
<p>I haven’t been on enough red carpets to regret any choice. But maybe in a few years when I look back, I might have a few regrets.</p>
<p>Fashion and beauty are important to your profession. do you sometimes get tired of keeping up?</p>
<p>I do get tired of keeping up sometimes. At times, I like to keep it casual with pyjamas and a messy bun, no make-up and just a lip balm. I like to visit a restaurant looking like that. But as with every job, this one comes with a few sacrifices. I’m okay with these sacrifices because this job is worth everything.</p>
<p>The most stylish actor and actress in Bollywood…</p>
<p>Ranveer Singh and his female counterpart; the beautiful Deepika Padukone.</p>
<p>One person whose wardrobe you would like to raid?</p>
<p>Alia Bhatt’s for sure. She’s comfortable in her own skin. I love what she wears because it always suits her. I’d love to have her clothes.</p>
<p>Your all-time fashion icon…</p>
<p>Grace Kelly.</p>
<p>One trend you want to try…</p>
<p>I’ve seen this trend online where people wear bandanas as tops. It looks chic and stylish.</p>
<p>A colour that looks best on you…</p>
<p>Black looks best on me, so do bright pink and yellow.</p>
<p>One fashion myth you’d like to bust for the girls/boys?</p>
<p>Wear what you want. It’s not like if you’re a girl you have to wear a dress; if you want to wear a suit, wear it and own it. If you’re a guy and want to paint your nails pink, do it. Stop following gender norms.</p>
<p>Your ideal dress for a date night…</p>
<p>Either a white lace dress or a polka dot dress. I like to keep it classic.</p>
<p>What would you like to see your beau wearing for the first date night?</p>
<p>A white linen, beachy shirt and a nice pair of jeans.</p>
<p>Who according to you pulls off a saree best?</p>
<p>Sushmita Sen and Priyanka Chopra, both are so elegant.</p>
<p>Back stilettos or red pumps?</p>
<p>Black stilettos, always.</p>
<p>Who according to you pulls off the best red lips in Bollywood?</p>
<p>Aishwarya Rai Bachchan looks the best in a red lip. I don’t think anyone can rock a red lip like her. Especially, after seeing how beautiful she looked in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, I’ve become a huge fan of the red lip trend.</p>
<p>A trend you’re seen wearing the most…</p>
<p>I’m into cargo pants. That’s what you’re going to be seeing me wearing the most paired with a crop top.</p>
<p>You favourite off-duty outfit&hellip;</p>
<p>My mom’s pyjamas paired with my dad’s t-shirt.</p>
<p>Three words that describe your personal style.</p>
<p>Comfortable, casual and chic.</p>
<p>Five wardrobe essentials for the season for girls:
