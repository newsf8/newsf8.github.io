When 5 Seconds of Summer named their fourth studio album “CALM,” out Friday, the band had no idea how much that quality would be needed in the world today.</p>
<p>“The album title came from the first letters of all of our names,” says lead singer Luke Hemmings, 23, of bandmates Calum Hood (bass), Ashton Irwin (drums) and Michael Clifford (guitar). “And it’s also a nod to our fans that coined us that name in our early days. They’ve been using that acronym for a long time. It kind of just sums up [that] we’re a little bit older and a little bit wiser . . . But it was named before this went down, obviously.”</p>
<p>Of course, Hemmings is referring to the coronavirus crisis that has left the world shaken — and that certainly shook up their plans to release “CALM,” as each of the previous LPs from the Australian pop-rock band debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart. “We were gonna go all over the world, do all these kinds of things, and then we just couldn’t,” he says. “But honestly, we wanted the album out really badly. We were waiting a long time for it to come out.”</p>
<p>While Hemmings has been staying at home in Los Angeles, he has been communicating with his bandmates — all of whom also live in LA — through Zoom. And he has found some positives in taking this pause from their plans. On his daily walks with his girlfriend, Sierra Deaton, he says, “People have more time to say hi or give a smile. In such an unrelaxed, uncertain time . . . everyone seems a bit kinder.”</p>
<p>The band is partnering with the Calm app on four exclusive remixes of new album tracks “Easier,” “Old Me,” “Red Desert” and “Best Years” that are designed to chill your nerves. Hemmings says that he was already a fan of the app. “It’s a tool that I use to help with my own mental health,” he says, pointing out that his favorite features are “the walk-through meditations and stuff to go to sleep. The Matthew McConaughey bedtime stories are pretty awesome.”</p>
<p>As for how else he stays calm, Hemmings says, “I try and exercise every day, because unfortunately it’s extremely linked to your mental health. ‘Unfortunately’ I say for my laziness.”

<h3 id="album-review-5-seconds-of-summer---calm--gigwise">Album Review: 5 Seconds Of Summer - CALM | Gigwise</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.livehub.me/image_068c9656-2d42-4cf3-b23f-f4bd96de6821.jpg?width=1500&amp;height=1500" alt="img">
‘Near-perfection pop’</p>
<p>Australian quartet 5 Seconds of Summer’s fourth studio album - and follow-up to 2018’s Youngblood - CALM has been a much-anticipated offering.</p>
<p>Opening with the groovy, anthemic ‘Red Desert’, the album is set up for bigger and better things, before the radio-friendly soundscape of latest single ‘No Shame’ highlights the foursome’s ability to layer explosive instrumentals over meaningful lyrics and raw stories.</p>
<p>The album’s title is an acronym of the member’s first names; Calum, Ashton, Luke and Michael, and the message of the album seems suitably personal if tracks such as the retrospective ‘Old Me’ are anything to go by.</p>
<p>The lead single, ‘Easier’ conveys electro-influenced melodic flair, and follow-up single ‘Teeth’ grapples with a grungy, rock-tinged delivery and a catchy chorus, making for undeniable highlights on this 12-track production. Set back-to-back, these tracks cement the quartet’s sonic range before ‘ Wildflower’ comes through at the halfway point, as the most repeat-worthy pop offering on the record.</p>
<p>From there on, the album shifts from catchy arrangements to fluid instrumental setups. Starting with the balladeering ‘Best Years’ and piano-led ‘Lover Of Mine’, followed by the angst-ridden ‘Thin White Lies’ and slow-burn, vocal-centric ‘Lonely Heart’.</p>
<p>Split into two distinct, yet cohesive, sections of music that are authentically 5SOS, the album is a look into the journey of four young boys growing up and getting pulled into the addictive power of fame – for example, the self-reflective closing track ‘High’.</p>
<p>As CALM comes to an end and the final notes of the song peter out, we’re left with a sense of fulfilment, peace and unsurprisingly an overwhelming feeling of calmness. It’s not without some kinks though – among the depth of well-made music lie forgettable tracks such as ‘Not In The Same Way’; there’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s nothing particularly impressive either.</p>
<p>Despite that niggling urge to skip the odd mediocre track, the desire to play beauties like ‘High’ on loop wins in the end and CALM stands on a pedestal of near-perfection pop.</p>
<p>CALM is released on 27 March 2020 via Polydor Records.

<h3 id="5-seconds-of-summers-new-song-wildflower-is-a-choose-your-own-adventure">5 Seconds of Summer’s New Song ‘Wildflower’ Is a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/5sos-album-announcement.jpg" alt="img">
5 Seconds of Summer have released the dreamy new song “Wildflower,” off their fourth album, Calm, which drops Friday. They co-wrote the track with Rami Yacoub (Britney Spears, Ariana Grande).</p>
<p>“Wildflower” is the brightest-sounding song yet off the upcoming record — and gives a clear nod to Eighties synth-pop. It’s also meant to have an open-ended meaning, according to the band; they omitted keywords from the chorus so that people can add whatever feels best for them: “You’re the only one who makes/Every time we,” goes the refrain.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make the chorus kind of a choose-your-own-adventure, where some words are left out and then accentuated by these big stabs of synth,” bassist Calum Hood explained in a statement. “It lets everyone come up with their own interpretation and fill in whatever they think those missing lyrics might be.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the release of Calm, the band announced a partnership with the wellness app Calm. Beginning on Thursday, the app will feature remixes of four songs from the upcoming LP, all meant to assist in meditation and relaxation. Each member of the band assisted with an individual remix.
