A teenage boy has been arrested in Waterford in connection with an investigation into people coughing on others on purpose.</p>
<p>He was picked up for a public order offence in Dungarvan on Monday.</p>
<p>Separately, a nurse says a group of teenagers surrounded and coughed on her while she was out for a run in Clontarf in Dublin.</p>
<p>And gardaí are investigating reports of a man coughing into the face of an elderly couple in Co Kildare.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan says gardaí have the power to act on this so-called ‘corona challenge’.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come from a totalitarian or authoritarian perspective here because I believe the gardaí are there to help, they&rsquo;re there to assist, they&rsquo;re there to support, they&rsquo;re there to advise,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If more is needed we have the law and that&rsquo;s why the Dail sat last week to give emergency powers in terms of assisting further the gardaí to enforce the new regime should they deem it necessary.&rdquo;

<h3 id="report-corona-challenge-spitting-incidents-immediately">Report “Corona Challenge” spitting incidents immediately</h3>
<p><img src="https://wicklownews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Garda-1.jpg" alt="img">
Gardai are urging members of the public to report incidents of the new Social Media “Corona Challenge” immediately.</p>
<p>The new challenge where people spit or cough at others making them believe they have the Coronavirus is the new internet craze.</p>
<p>A number of incidents have been reported in North Wicklow however no arrests have been made.</p>
<p>Sgt John Fitzpatrick of Bray Garda Station is appealing to the public to report such incidents immediately, and not wait until you get home, contact your local Garda Station.</p>
<p>Garda are taking reports of such incidents very seriously, and can respond quicker</p>
<p>He added young people may not realise they could be committing a non-fatal offence or public order act, also the victim may believe they are going to be assaulted.</p>
<p>He appealed to parents to have a conversation in the home and make youths realise the impact these challenges have on people.

<h3 id="irish-politician-urges-legal-action-over-thugs-taking-part-in-corona-challenge">Irish politician urges legal action over ‘thugs’ taking part in ‘Corona Challenge’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thecanary.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2.49946108-720x422.jpg" alt="img">
A Fianna Fail TD (MP) has called for legal action to be taken against people joking about having coronavirus while deliberately coughing into others’ faces.</p>
<p>Kildare North TD James Lawless said “thugs” are taking videos of themselves coughing into people’s faces and posting them online as part of the so-called Corona Challenge.</p>
<p>The party’s spokesperson on science, technology, research and development said it is a serious offence to cause another person to believe they have become infected with a disease.</p>
<p>Lawless, a barrister by profession, said he has been made aware of teenagers and young people deliberately coughing into the faces of others and spitting at them in a bid to intimidate and frighten them.</p>
<p>The Corona Challenge involves young people filming themselves while coughing into others’ faces and posting it on social media app TikTok.</p>
<p>Lawless said: “This really is too serious to be explained away with a ‘boys will be boys’ attitude.</p>
<p>“People are desperately frightened of these thugs who are laughing and jeering about having Covid-19 while coughing directly into people’s faces – it’s disgusting.</p>
<p>“There are grounds for this in the statute books. Under Section 6 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against The Person Act 1997, it is an offence to spray, pour or put on to a person blood or any fluid or substance resembling blood, leading a person to believe that they have become infected with disease as a result.</p>
<p>“Section 1 of the Act makes specific reference to contaminated fluid and Section 2 covers the intentional or reckless application of force in liquid form.</p>
<p>“In the midst of this crisis it’s unfortunate that we would even need to remind young people that by carrying out these reprehensible acts they could actually be convicted of a very serious crime.”</p>
<p>He added: “It’s time for parents to step up, they need to make sure their children are aware of the consequences of their actions.”
