Rhea&rsquo;s latest project is director Sonam Nair&rsquo;s short film &ldquo;Boom Boom&rdquo;, which recently premiered on Zee5</p>
<p>Actor Rhea Chakraborty is unfazed by the rumours of her relationship with actor Sushant Singh Rajput as she believes being talked about their personal lives is an extension of working in the showbiz.</p>
<p>There have been reports that the duo is dating but actors haven&rsquo;t confirmed their relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sushant is a fear friend. It (spotlight) doesn&rsquo;t bother me. We are people who are in the limelight. If we want people to watch your films, they will also want to talk about our personal lives. It&rsquo;s the most common psychology to discuss other people. So I don&rsquo;t get bothered by it,&rdquo; Rhea told.</p>
<p>The actor, who started off as a VJ on MTV, made her Bollywood debut with &ldquo;Mere Dad Ki Maruti&rdquo; in 2013 and went on to feature in films like &ldquo;Sonali Cable&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jalebi&rdquo;. She will be next seen in Amitabh Bachchan-starrer &ldquo;Chehre&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My journey has been beautiful, more than what I could ask for. Of course there have been ups and downs but I&rsquo;ve been fortunate and grateful for this journey. It has taught me a lot, I&rsquo;ve grown, become a better actor and a human being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was in MTV, I wasn&rsquo;t really looking out to do films. I never even knew I would end up becoming an actor. It was coincidental for me. Once I did it, I realised it&rsquo;s what I really want to do. Like every other actor, I would want to prove my merit,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Rhea&rsquo;s latest project is director Sonam Nair&rsquo;s short film &ldquo;Boom Boom&rdquo;, which recently premiered on Zee5.</p>
<p>The actor said she is open to work in any medium as long as the content excites her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do actively look out for any kind of work, whether it&rsquo;s long form, short or web. I just look out for interesting characters. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where it is.</p>
<p>I do believe that maybe digital will pick up more than anything else. Now there will be a lot more people on it post quarantine because we have ended up using it a lot more.&rdquo;

Sushant Singh Rajput is one of the most sought-after actors in the Bollywood industry and commands a massive fan following not only for his guy next door looks but also for his incredible acting prowess.</p>
<p>2019 was an eventful year for the actor as his performance in his last project Chhichhore opposite Shraddha Kapoor was not only loved by fans but was also critically acclaimed.</p>
<p>However, ever since then, the Kedarnath actor has been missing from the limelight at least on the professional front.</p>
<p>But despite that, Sushant&rsquo;s love life has been the subject of intrigue and discussion. As per reports, the actor is said to be dating Rhea Chakraborty for a while now but the alleged couple has never spoken out or cleared the air about their relationship status.</p>
<p>Several reports suggest that Sushant and Rhea spend a lot of quality time as and when possible and often go out on vacations together.</p>
<p>But, the M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story actor, today, threw caution to the wind and shared a beautiful picture of Rhea on his Instagram story and the way he captioned the picture spoke a lot more than words ever could.</p>
<p>Sushant posted the picture of Rhea and captioned it calling the actress, &ldquo;Meri Jalebi&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant later was quick to delete the story but fans had already taken a screenshot and made the picture viral.</p>
<p>On the work front, Sushant will soon be seen in Mukesh Chhabra’s Dil Bechara which is the Bollywood remake of Hollywood movie The Fault In Our Stars.

<h3 id="what-is-your-relationship-status-with-sushant-singh-rajput-rhea-chakraborty-reveals">&ldquo;&lsquo;What Is Your Relationship Status With Sushant Singh Rajput?&rsquo; Rhea Chakraborty Reveals&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/utau1yfuqs0f9ey0_1580204653.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg" alt="img">
Sushant Singh Rajput and Rhea Chakraborty have been playing hide-and seek with the media for a while now. Rumours were further fueled when they went on holiday, were papped outside restaurants and were also spotted house-hunting. And then, recently, Rhea made it Instagram-official by posting a picture and a heartfelt note on Sushant&rsquo;s birthday. So, what is the relationship status?</p>
<p>Talking to a leading daily, Rhea said that they&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;very good friends&rdquo; for many years. She further said that she is fond of working &ldquo;towards their shared goals&rdquo; like starting their new NGO, and travelling. She concluded by saying she wouldn&rsquo;t want to disclose anything further yet with regards to the big question — &ldquo;If there is anything else between them or not&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Revealing her future projects, Rhea said that she will soon open a gym along with a friend. Talking about the NGO she will start with Sushant Singh Rajput and her brother, Rhea said that it will &ldquo;provide free education to needy children&rdquo; because she feels actors have &ldquo;certain powers&rdquo; that could be used for the &ldquo;right cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those unaware, recently Sushant Singh Rajput had posted a picture of Rhea on his Instagram story with the caption “meri jalebi” and tagging her. But as soon as the picture started getting viral, the actor had taken it down. This further ignited suspicions about their relationship.</p>
