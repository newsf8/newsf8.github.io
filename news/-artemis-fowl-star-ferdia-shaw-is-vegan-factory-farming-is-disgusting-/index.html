<p>&lsquo;They’re both animals, and they both just need love&rsquo;</p>
<p>Artemis Fowl star Ferdia Shaw has spoken out about why he is vegan (Photo: Disney)</p>
<p>The star of Artemis Fowl - which is streaming on Disney+ - has revealed why he is vegan and discussed his thoughts about animals and the way they are treated.</p>
<p>15-year-old Ferdia Shaw made the comments in a video he created with animal rights charity PETA.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website</p>
<p>Lessons from animals</p>
<p>Speaking about what he has learned from his dog and cat in the video, Shaw says: &ldquo;My dog has taught me that it’s really the simple things that can make her so happy. Like, all she needs is a family to love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then jokes: &ldquo;And my cat has taught me that she’s the boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shaw says there is no difference between the animals people love and keep as companion animals, and animals who are farmed so people can eat them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting&rsquo;</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;They’re both animals, and they both just need love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[I]t’s disgusting how they’re treated on these farms. They’re living in their own filth, and some animals don’t even ever see the light of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 50 years’ time, I hope that we will look back on our treatment of animals with disgust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Got to change&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shaw adds: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in such an easy world to get alternative to those [foods],&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but people just don&rsquo;t like breaking their rhythm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to do. We&rsquo;ve got to change up the routine. If I ruled the world I would ban any eating of animals.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/CM-COMP-SHAW-V2-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
AFTER tales about a certain boy wizard struck gold, a stream of new children’s books were soon declared “the new Harry Potter”.</p>
<p>But perhaps Artemis Fowl, the film adaptation of which hits screens today, was the most deserving of the title.</p>

<p>And if it is anywhere near as successful as the movies from JK Rowling’s series, it will catapult lead actor Ferdia Shaw to super-stardom.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old, who beat 1,000 other hopefuls to land the role of child criminal mastermind Artemis, is an unknown newcomer.</p>
<p>But as the grandson of legendary Jaws actor Robert Shaw, film-making is in his blood.</p>
<p>Robert, who died in 1978 at the age of 51, is best known for his role as shark-hunter Quint.</p>
<p>10 Ferdia’s grandfather Robert Shaw played shark-hunter Sam Quint in Jaws, 1975 Credit: Alamy</p>
<p>But as one of his era’s highest-paid British actors in Hollywood, he also portrayed a string of menacing baddies, including assassin Donald “Red” Grant in 1963 Bond film From Russia With Love and mobster Doyle Lonnegan in 1973’s The Sting.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview, Ferdia told The Sun: “I love his films, he was always so cool, and I love the way he acted in them.</p>
<p>“He was always so evil. He’s got a great character and it’s a shame that I never got to meet him.”</p>
<p>Notorious hell-raiser Robert was married three times and had ten children, two of whom were adopted.</p>
<p>10 Ferdia’s mentor Dame Judi as Commander Root with her army followers Credit: AP:Associated Press</p>
<p>Ferdia’s dad Colin was the child of Robert and second wife Mary Ure, a Scottish actress who was nominated for an Oscar for 1960 movie Sons And Lovers.</p>
<p>She died in 1975 aged 42 after drinking champagne and taking sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Colin, 58, did not follow his parents into showbusiness and works in IT, but his brother Ian, 50, is a successful actor, with a credit for EastEnders on his CV.</p>
<p>Ferdia said: “My grandad and my uncle were definitely one of the reasons I got into acting. I have always loved film and TV. I have seen Jaws, I’ve seen The Sting, I’ve seen From Russia With Love.”</p>
<p>NO RED CARPET LAUNCH</p>
<p>Ferdia’s uncle Ian wrote highly acclaimed stage play The Shark Is Broken, about the making of Jaws.</p>
<p>But its West End run was halted due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The pandemic has had an equally dramatic effect on the Artemis Fowl movie, which stars Dame Judi Dench, Colin Farrell and Josh Gad.</p>
<p>Based on Eoin Colfer’s eight-book series — which has sold more than 24million copies globally since the first novel was released in 2001 — it was due to hit the big screen at the end of last month.</p>
<p>10 Ferdia and Colin Farrell star as father and son Credit: Alamy</p>
<p>But with cinemas now closed, the £100million film will instead be available to stream on new channel Disney+ from today.</p>
<p>Other lockdown movies being released straight on to the small screen include Tom Hanks’ World War Two drama Greyhound, Trolls sequel Trolls World Tour and the new Scooby-Doo flick Scoob!</p>
<p>Sadly, no cinema release also means no red carpet launch for Ferdia.</p>
<p>He said: “I am a little disappointed, but so many people are watching films at home now, so we might even get a wider audience, which would be really good.”</p>

<p>Normally, our chat would take place in a swanky hotel.</p>
<p>For Ferdia, however, this “new normal” is just “normal”.</p>
<p>And he is just as thrilled that people can finally see him as Artemis Fowl.</p>
<p>He said: “I can’t wait — it’s so soon now. It’s been delayed so many times.</p>

<p>“I have been wanting to get it out. It’s hugely exciting. We will get the whole family in Kilkenny to watch the premiere.”</p>
<p>Ferdia’s only previous acting experience was an after-school project making short films.</p>
<p>He also appeared in a documentary about his grandfather Robert.</p>
<p>Dad Colin and mum Lucy, who is a breast-feeding counsellor, fully supported their son’s decision to audition for the movie.</p>

<p>But Ferdia admits it was “daunting” stepping on set for the first time.</p>
<p>He adds that the movie’s director, Sir Kenneth Branagh, quickly made him feel relaxed and he “learned a lot” from watching Dame Judi.</p>
<p>But he spent the most time with fellow Irishman Colin Farrell, who plays his on-screen dad.</p>
<p>Ferdia said: “We had some really good conversations together. We had fun.”</p>
<p>FANTASY WORLD</p>
<p>One downside, though, was the “suit of woe”.</p>
<p>Artemis sports a Men In Black-style whistle and shades, and appears unruffled at all times.</p>
<p>As the outfit had to look immaculate throughout, the suit was an all-in-one piece that Ferdia had to climb into and peel himself out of.</p>
<p>He said: “The suit itself isn’t really a suit, it’s more a body suit.</p>
<p>10 Robert Shaw died in 1978 at the age of 51 Credit: Alamy</p>
<p>“It is made out of a really stretchy material so there were no creases in the shirt as we were filming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you climbed into it. We used to call it ‘the suit of woe’ because it was really uncomfortable. But it looks really, really cool.”</p>
<p>The big-budget movie also features a mansion, called Fowl Manor, in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>It took 300 people five months to build specially for the shoot.</p>

<p>And there are state-of-the-art special effects to bring alive the fantasy world of elves, goblins and hi-tech fairy ships.</p>
<p>But while the film has retained a lot of the original story from the first novel, Artemis’s character has been altered significantly.</p>
<p>In the novels, the young hero is a cunning thief stealing to enrich himself.</p>
<p>For the Disney production, the “criminal mastermind” is more heroic, plotting for a good cause.</p>
<p>10 The fantasy film will be available to stream on new channel Disney+ Credit: Alamy</p>
<p>Ferdia said: “Eoin has been completely supportive of all the changes we have made.</p>
<p>“The books and the films are their own separate entities, completely different. Our version of Artemis is very light-hearted.</p>
<p>“He still has an edge but he is kind-hearted as well. Both variations of Artemis are very cool.”</p>
<p>Like much of the world, Ferdia has spent the past few months in lockdown, missing school and exams.</p>
<p>There is already talk of a second Artemis movie and Ferdia says he is “open” to auditioning for a variety of other roles.</p>

<h3 id="video-artemis-fowl-star-ferdia-shaw-reveals-why-hes-vegan">&ldquo;VIDEO: ‘Artemis Fowl’ Star Ferdia Shaw Reveals Why He’s Vegan&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.peta.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PETA_Ferdia-Shaw-2-870x420.jpg" alt="img">
With Artemis Fowl now out on Disney+”, PETA caught up with the film’s star, Ferdia Shaw, for a new video to discuss the lessons he’s learned from his animal companions – and why he wishes everyone were vegan.</p>
<p>In the video, the compassionate young actor says there’s no difference between the animals in his family and a pig or a cow in the meat industry:</p>
<p>“They’re both animals, and they both just need love. [I]t’s disgusting how they’re treated on these farms. They’re living in their own filth, and some animals don’t even ever see the light of day. In 50 years’ time, I hope that we will look back on our treatment of animals with disgust.”</p>
<p>Jan Sztemon</p>
<p>Ferdia joins a growing list of celebrities – including Paul McCartney, Peter Dinklage, and Alan Cumming – who have teamed up with PETA or its international affiliates to promote kindness towards animals.</p>
<p>Why Vegan?</p>
<p>All animals reared for food are exploited and abused. Females are repeatedly forcibly impregnated. Babies are torn away from their mothers, mutilated, and kept in filthy and severely crowded conditions. Then, often when they’re only a few months old, they endure a stressful and terrifying trip to the abattoir, where many are killed while still conscious.</p>
<p>There are so many delicious and healthy plant-based options available that following in Ferdia’s footsteps and going vegan is now easier than ever. Order our free vegan starter kit to get more tips from PETA on eating vegan and to show that you’re serious about ending animal exploitation and taking a stand against speciesism.

<p><img src="https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/artemis-fowl.jpg" alt="img">
The first franchise that comes to one’s mind when “Young Adult fantasy” is uttered, is ‘Harry Potter.’ The image that forms in one’s head is probably that of a geeky, bespectacled boy with a scar on his forehead, a.k.a. Daniel Radcliffe. The genre’s popularity has a knack of turning child actors into overnight stars with another example being Logan Lerman (his stardom was obviously lesser than that of Radcliffe).</p>
<p>Disney’s ‘Artemis Fowl‘ certainly has the potential to catapult its lead actor, Ferdia Shaw onto significant amounts of fame. He plays the titular character in the adaptation of an incredibly popular and successful series of novels by Eoin Colfer, after all. Due to the sheer potential of the role, Shaw’s selection was suitably a result of him being the cream of the crop. Reportedly, Shaw was selected out of 1,200 contestants!</p>
<p>Now, the movie might have disappointed readers and viewers heavily, but Shaw remains to be one of the few good things about the Disney film. He is definitely able to exude the suave-ness of a glares-sporting genius kid with conviction. So, who is Ferdia Shaw?</p>
<p>How Old is Ferdia Shaw?</p>
<p>Ferdia Shaw was born in Dublin, Ireland on June 29, 2004. Hence, he is going to turn sixteen this month (as of this day). This may come as a surprise to many given the fact that he plays a twelve-year-old in the movie (rather convincingly).</p>
<p>Who Are Ferdia Shaw’s Parents?</p>
<p>Many viewers would have wondered who Ferdia Shaw’s parents are. Does he have “the acting genes?” Well, he does have “the acting genes,” but neither his mother nor his father is an actor.</p>
<p>Congrats to Ferdia Shaw, pictured below, with mum Lucy Glendinning and artist Danleo. Ferdia has been cast in the… Posted by Greensbridge250 on Friday, December 22, 2017</p>
<p>As you can see, the above post reveals how Ferdia Shaw is also into street art and music. Anyway, the above post also reveals the name of Shaw’s mother: Lucy Glendinning. A quick google search of her name reveals the fact that she is an artist who studied fine art and sculpture at the University of the West of England Bristol. She has held exhibitions in a variety of different places all over the world. There is a possibility that Ferdia Shaw’s mother might be a different Lucy Glendinning but the chances of that are low, as evidenced by the above post wherein Shaw’s mother appears to be an artist.

<p><img src="https://img-4.linternaute.com/oCB6n16mrO6SX5nr-452UZqtQSI=/540x/smart/03c7cc0dfa4e4a3bb6a8e0a6a91a26c2/ccmcms-linternaute/16340173.jpg" alt="img">
Pour la sortie du film Artemis Fowl, les jeunes acteurs Ferdia Shaw et Lara McDonnell ont répondu à nos questions. Ils y évoquent un tournage détendu où ils ont beaucoup appris.</p>
<p>Pour porter son film d&rsquo;aventures fantastiques Artemis Fowl, Kenneth Branagh a recruté deux jeunes acteurs irlandais pour respecter la vision de l&rsquo;auteur des romans Eoin Colfer. Au terme d&rsquo;un long processus d&rsquo;auditions, c&rsquo;est Ferdia Shaw et Lara McDonnell qui ont été choisis pour les rôles d&rsquo;Artemis Fowl, le génie du crime âgé de 12 ans, et Holly Short, la fée qu&rsquo;il capture pour entrer en communication avec le monde souterrain qu&rsquo;il vient de découvrir. Dans une interview par visioconférence, les deux jeunes comédiens ont partagé avec Linternaute.com leurs anecdotes de tournage.</p>
<p>Etiez-vous fans des livres avant de jouer dans le film ?</p>
<p>Ferdia Shaw : Oui, on était déjà fans. C&rsquo;est pourquoi nous étions très à l&rsquo;aise en jouant ces personnages. On ajoutait nos propres répliques, Ken nous laissait régulièrement l&rsquo;opportunité de donner notre avis. C'était une chance de connaître les livres avant de travailler sur ce projet.</p>
<p>Vous vous rappelez de votre première rencontre ?</p>
<p>Lara McDonnell : Je m&rsquo;en souviens très bien. C'était ma deuxième audition et lui sa troisième. On nous a emmenés à Londres, c&rsquo;est là qu&rsquo;on a rencontré Kenneth Branagh pour la première fois. C&rsquo;est aussi là que j&rsquo;ai fait la connaissance de Ferdia pour la première fois et j&rsquo;ai su dès l&rsquo;instant où je l&rsquo;ai vu que c'était un fauteur de troubles !</p>
<p>Ferdia, vous avez pu jouer face à Colin Farrell. Vous a-t-il aidé sur le tournage ?</p>
<p>F. S. : C&rsquo;est un acteur tellement expérimenté que c&rsquo;est impossible de ne pas remarquer ce qu&rsquo;il fait. Le simple fait de le voir jouer son rôle m&rsquo;a aidé. C'était toujours génial de le regarder jouer parce que c&rsquo;est un excellent acteur.</p>
<p>Bien sûr, vous avez dû faire des cascades dans le film. Comment c'était ?</p>
<p>F. S. : J&rsquo;ai fait pas mal de cascades avec des filins. Lorsqu&rsquo;il y a des explosions par exemple ou quand j&rsquo;ai dû tomber d&rsquo;un chandelier par exemple. J&rsquo;ai aussi appris à me déplacer en Onewheel jusqu&rsquo;au manoir des Fowl. C&rsquo;est une route sinueuse et je devais la faire rapidement donc j&rsquo;ai dû m&rsquo;entraîner là-dessus.</p>
<p>L. M. : C'était génial. On a travaillé avec une super équipe de cascadeurs qui faisaient toujours attention à notre sécurité, ce qui est évidemment important quand on fait quelque chose qu&rsquo;on n&rsquo;a jamais fait avant. J&rsquo;ai pu apprendre plein de nouvelles choses : la gymnastique, le self-défense, le kickboxing et bien sûr j&rsquo;ai appris à voler. Je dois dire que c'était plutôt cool !</p>
<p>Se trimbaler avec tout cet attirail de filins a dû être difficile…</p>
<p>L. M. : Un peu parce que je n&rsquo;avais pas encore eu cette expérience. Mais une fois qu&rsquo;on devient à l&rsquo;aise avec l'équipement, comme je le faisais presque tous les jours, ça devient presque une seconde nature.</p>
<p>A quoi ressemblait l&rsquo;ambiance sur le tournage ?</p>
<p>L. M. : On s&rsquo;est bien amusés parce que l'équipe faisait en sorte qu&rsquo;on soit très à l&rsquo;aise sur le plateau. Le film est très drôle et les personnages, notamment Holly et Artemis, sont vifs ce qui nous a permis de plaisanter sur le tournage. Et quand les caméras ne tournaient pas, on s&rsquo;amusait beaucoup mais jamais pendant les séances de tutorat, on était toujours très concentrés pendant le tutorat !</p>
<p>F. S. : (il sourit) Oui, on était super concentrés !</p>
<p>Je sens comme une petite pointe d&rsquo;ironie !</p>
<p>L. M. : Un tout petit peu !</p>
<p>Avez-vous pu garder un accessoire du film ?</p>
<p>F. S. : J&rsquo;ai gardé mon Onewheel ! Bon, je suis rentré dans un portail avec donc il attend tranquillement de pouvoir être réparé mais c'était très sympa les premiers jours !</p>
