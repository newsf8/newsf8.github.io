<p>Steve Bing, philanthropist, film producer and prominent Democratic political donor whose producing credits included “The Polar Express” and “Get Carter,” died Monday.</p>
<p>Bing, 55, fell to his death from a high-rise building in Century City, according to a law enforcement source who was not authorized to comment. L.A. County coroner’s spokeswoman Sarah Ardalani said an autopsy conducted Tuesday determined that Bing died of multiple blunt trauma injuries and that the cause of death was suicide.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department said it responded to a call around 1 p.m. on Monday regarding the death of a man in his 50s in the 10000 block of Santa Monica Boulevard in Century City. The site is a 40-floor luxury apartment complex called Ten Thousand, where Bing lived.</p>
<p>“This is the only information we have at this time,” said Capt. Gisselle Espinoza, an LAPD spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Known to be media-shy, the real estate scion was a Harvard Westlake graduate who inherited a $600-million fortune at the age of 18.</p>
<p>Bing, a major Democratic donor and a friend of President Bill Clinton, went on to Stanford but dropped out in his junior year to pursue filmmaking. Rangy and silver-haired, the 6-foot-4 producer often was seen dressed casually in jeans and gym shoes.</p>
<p>I loved Steve Bing very much. He had a big heart, and he was willing to do anything he could for the people and causes he believed in. I will miss him and his enthusiasm more than I can say, and I hope he’s finally found peace. — Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) June 23, 2020</p>
<p>Clinton joined those online expressing their sadness. “I loved Steve Bing very much,” Clinton tweeted. “He had a big heart, and was willing to do anything he could for the people and causes he believed in. I will miss him and his enthusiasm more than I can say, I hope he’s finally found peace.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Bing’s name was thrust into the spotlight when he became involved in two highly publicized paternity cases. In one, he sued British actress Elizabeth Hurley to force a DNA test after she said he was the father of her baby.</p>
<p>In the other case, he sued Kirk Kerkorian for invasion of privacy after the billionaire’s private eye — the infamous Anthony Pellicano — took Bing’s dental floss out of his trash can. Kerkorian was embroiled in a child-support lawsuit with his ex-wife, Lisa Bonder. He used the DNA from the floss to prove that Bing was the father of Bonder’s child, Kira.</p>
<p>An English court revealed that Bing indeed was the father of Hurley’s baby. Hurley and Bing’s son, Damian, turned 18 in April.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Both Hurley and Damian posted to social media in the wake of Bing’s death. “It is a terrible end,” said Hurley on her Instagram account, where she included several photos of her with Bing. “Although we went through some tough times, it’s the good, wonderful memories of a sweet, kind man that matter.” She said they had become close again in the past year and last spoke on their son’s birthday. Damian Hurley said the news was “devastating.”</p>
<p>The source of Bing’s wealth was a family real estate fortune established by his grandfather, Leo Bing. (Bing’s middle name is Leo.) The family has a history of philanthropy, with the Bing name gracing art museums and concert halls across the state, including the L.A. County Museum of Art’s Leo S. Bing Theatre (recently demolished).</p>
<p>His father, Dr. Peter Bing, worked on public health issues for the Johnson White House before relocating to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The younger Bing cultivated something of a latter-day Howard Hughes mystique and reportedly lived for years in the Hotel Bel-Air. He was friends with stars such as Brad Pitt but also fell out with other actors, including Sean Penn, whom he sued over a movie role.</p>
<p>He was best known for his backing of filmmakers and musicians. Bing was a self-professed lifelong fan of Jerry Lee Lewis and helped finance the musician’s return to the recording studio, coproducing his album “Rock &amp; Roll Time” with veteran studio drummer Jim Keltner. He produced Martin Scorsese’s “Shine a Light” documentary about the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Before he finished school, Bing had already cowritten his first screenplay, called “Missing in Action,” with veteran sitcom writer Arthur Silver. It was made into a Chuck Norris film and spawned a sequel.</p>
<p>He directed an erotic thriller titled “Every Breath,” starring Judd Nelson, which went straight to video.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Bing launched his own production company, Shangri-La Entertainment, in 2000 and produced several movies, including the Sylvester Stallone picture “Get Carter” and the Bill Murray comedy “Rock the Kasbah.” He put up about $85 million to finance Robert Zemeckis’ 2004 animated film “The Polar Express,” featuring Tom Hanks.</p>
<p>Bing also gave to many musical and artistic causes.</p>
<p>Musician Flea, best known as the bassist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, posted on social media that Bing was “a kind and thoughtful man. A massive help in building the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, he went up and beyond to help us educate children who couldn’t otherwise afford it, he just cared and never wanted accolades. God bless his beautiful soul.”</p>
<p>In 2012, Bing pledged $30 million as an estate gift to the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund. “We were enormously grateful when he gave the gift,” said Bob Beitcher, chief executive of the MPTF. “He was a big supporter.”</p>
<p>Times staff writer Kevin Rector contributed to this report.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sushant Singh Rajput was perhaps best known for playing legendary cricketer MS Dhoni</p>
<p>A rising star in Bollywood, Sushant Singh Rajput, has been found dead in his apartment in Mumbai.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old is believed to have taken his own life, Mumbai police said.</p>
<p>Popular for his acting in both TV and film, Rajput is perhaps best known for MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, where he played the legendary cricketer.</p>
<p>Many have been paying tributes to Rajput, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called him &ldquo;a bright young actor gone too soon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s death comes just days after that of his former manager.</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @narendramodi Sushant Singh Rajput&hellip;a bright young actor gone too soon. He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 14, 2020 Report</p>
<p>Born in the eastern state of Bihar, Rajput dropped out of a university course in engineering to pursue a career in acting and dance.</p>
<p>His Bollywood breakthrough came in the 2013 film Kai Po Che, which won acclaim at the Berlin film festival.</p>
<p>The actor&rsquo;s last film was Chhichhore, which was released last year. The film&rsquo;s director Nitesh Tiwari said he had spoken to Rajput last week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at a loss for words. I spoke to him last week over messages. We would text each other on and off. Now this is what I get to hear. He was like a younger brother to me,&rdquo; he told the Press Trust of India (PTI).</p>
<p>In his last post to his 10.2 million Instagram followers on 3 June, Rajput posted a picture of his late mother, who died in 2002, when he was a teenager, according to PTI.</p>
<p>He wrote: &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His former manager, Disha Salian, 28, died earlier this week after falling from the 14th floor of a building in Mumbai.</p>
<p>In a Instagram story after her death, Rajput wrote: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news. My deepest condolences to Disha&rsquo;s family and friends. May your soul rest in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His death will be mourned by Bollywood fans across the globe still reeling from the deaths of legendary actors Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan within days of each other in April.</p>

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/20/obituaries/20FORTUNE1/20FORTUNE1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
While the terms that tended to attach themselves to Paul Fortune — style guru, epitome of taste, acme of chic, arbiter elegantiarum — had about them a whiff of P.T. Barnum, his tax returns said “interior designer,” a job description that failed to capture his larger calling as a self-appointed ringmaster in the social circus of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mr. Fortune died on June 15 in Ojai, Calif., at 69. His death, of cardiac arrest, was first announced on the website of Architectural Digest, where he was regularly listed among the top 100 professionals in his field, and confirmed by his husband, the ceramist Chris Brock.</p>
<p>Both professionally and personally, Mr. Fortune attracted to him a wide array of types, including the boldface clients (Sofia Coppola, Marc Jacobs, David Fincher, Brian Grazer, Aileen Getty) on whom he staked his reputation; billionaires and busboys; socialites and drug dealers; artists and writers; celebrities and the attractive nobodies that still flock to Los Angeles seeking fame.</p>
<p>Back when he was taking his first steps toward stardom, a certain unknown British actor named Daniel Craig bunked in the guest room of Mr. Fortune’s storied Laurel Canyon house.

Joel Schumacher, who directed some two dozen films including Batman Forever, Batman &amp; Robin, Brat Pack pics St. Elmo’s Fire and The Lost Boys along with Falling Down and John Grisham adaptations The Client and A Time to Kill, died today. He was 80.</p>

<p>His publicists at ID PR said he had a yearlong battle with cancer.</p>
<p>Schumacher was revered as one of Hollywood’s great storytellers. He had enormous charm and wit and could walk onto a tense set and instantly change everyone’s mood. It was magic chemistry.</p>
<p>His credits also include the 1980s pics D.C. Cab and The Incredible Shrinking Woman. He also helmed The Phantom of the Opera, Flatliners, Flawless, 8MM Phone Booth, Trespass and most recently two 2013 episodes of Netflix’s House of Cards.</p>

<p>The native New Yorker also wrote the 1976 low-budget comedy Car Wash and the screenplays for a pair of film adaptations of Broadway musicals: 1978’s The Wiz and 2004’s The Phantom of the Opera — along with his films Flawless, St. Elmo’s Fire and D.C. Cab. He also penned the 1976 feature Sparkle, which was remade in 2012.</p>

<p>He also was in the director’s chair for some high-profile music videos including Seal’s chart-topping hit “Kiss from a Rose,” from 1995’s Batman Forever; and INXS’ “Devil Inside” (1988); and the Smashing Pumpkins’ “The End Is the Beginning Is the End,” which earned Schumacher a Best Director nom at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>
<p>Born on August 29, 1939, in NYC, Schumacher first made his name as a costume designer for such 1070s pics as Woody Allen’s Sleeper and Interiors, along with Blume in Love, The Prisoner of Second Avenue and The Last of Sheila. He also was production designer on the 1974 telefilm Killer Bees during the disaster-movie era.</p>
<p>Schumacher directed some of Hollywood’s most in-demand stars, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise, George Clooney, Michael Douglas, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Anthony Hopkins, and Susan Sarandon. He also had a knack for helming young talents who would go on to be stars, such as Matthew McConaughey, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Farrell and Gerard Butler.</p>
<p>Michael Douglas in ‘Falling Down’ (1993) Moviestore/Shutterstock</p>
<p>The filmmaker’s Falling Down, starring Douglas as a frustrated everyman who explodes in rage, premiered at Cannes in 1993 and was a Palme d’Or nominee. His 1999 feature 8MM, starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini, was up for the Golden Bear at Berlin.</p>
<p>Schumacher also received the Distinguished Collaborator Award from the Costume Designers Guild in 2011 and that same year shared a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for the mental health documentary Half of Us.
