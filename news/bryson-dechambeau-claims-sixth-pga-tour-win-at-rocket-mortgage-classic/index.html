<p>DETROIT — Bryson DeChambeau got the result he was looking for from transforming his body.</p>
<p>With jaw-dropping drives and some clutch putts, DeChambeau won the Rocket Mortgage Classic by three strokes Sunday for his first victory of the season and sixth overall.</p>
<p>DeChambeau shot a 7-under 65 at Detroit Golf Club, birdieing four of the first seven holes and closing with three straight. He finished at a career-best 23-under 265.</p>
<p>Matthew Wolff (71) was second. He started the day with a three-shot lead and hurt his chances with five bogeys over his first 10 holes. Kevin Kisner (66) finished another stroke back.</p>
<p>DeChambeau removed all doubt with a strong finish.</p>
<p>He made a 30-foot birdie putt at No. 16, a short putt for birdie on the next hole and uncorked a 367-yard drive to set up another short putt at 18.</p>
<p>DeChambeau came into the week with six straight top-eight finishes and was the only player with top 10s in the first three events after the restart from the coronavirus. He won for the first time since the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in November 2018.</p>
<p>DeChambeau has dramatically changed his body, adding 40 pounds of mass, and took advantage of the time he had to work on his physique during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>His power was on full display in the Motor City with drives routinely went about 350 yards.</p>
<p>DeChambeau&rsquo;s drive on the 621-yard, par-5 fourth went way left and landed in greenside rough on an adjacent hole. He cleared trees and landed just short of the green, sending his approach 276 yards and he two-putted from 37 feet.</p>
<p>As his body and power becomes a fixation for those who follow golf, more eyes are on him and it bothered him during the third round.</p>
<p>On Saturday, DeChambeau had a testy exchange with a TV cameraman after a bogey on the sixth hole. After the round, he bristled that it isn’t right showing a potential vulnerability and hurting someone’s image.</p>

<h3 id="bryson-dechambeau-confronts-cameraman-over-damaging-filming">&ldquo;Bryson DeChambeau Confronts Cameraman Over &lsquo;Damaging&rsquo; Filming&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254083656.jpg?resize=1200,800" alt="img">
Bryson DeChambeau walks during the first round of the Rocket Mortgage Classic on July 03, 2020 at the Detroit Golf Club.</p>
<p>Being a professional athlete is as high-profile and high-pressure a profession as there is, and for one golfer, the pressure got to be too much on Saturday. American linksman Bryson DeChambeau had a rough time getting out of a bunker on the 7th hole at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit, and took his frustration out on a cameraman who was simply filming his post-shot reactions.</p>
<p>Bryson running a little hot. Caught up with him on 7 where he took a Sergio slash at the sand after splashing out of a greenside bunker, muttered an expletive after missing the par save and spent 60 seconds in a…testy discussion with a cameraman on his way to 8 tee. pic.twitter.com/ENjQt1U689 — Will Gray (@WillGrayGC) July 4, 2020</p>
<p>Essentially, DeChambeau was upset with the cameraman’s filming of his climb out of the bunker after a weak sand shot, as well as his reaction; the golfer slammed his club into the sand after the shot, and was visibly upset with his performance on the greenside bunker. He would eventually make bogey on the hole, and is currently tied for second place at the tournament.</p>
<p>However, afterwards, his focus was on the unnamed cameraman, saying that filming his reaction could damage his brand:</p>
<p>I mean, I understand it’s his job to video me, but at the same point, I think we need to start protecting our players out here compared to showing a potential vulnerability and hurting someone’s image. I just don’t think that’s necessarily the right thing to do.</p>
<p>As noted by Golf Channel, he kept going hours after the round, before blaming it on his love for the game:</p>
<p>We don’t mean anything by it, we just care a lot about the game. For that to damage our brand like that, that’s not cool in the way we act because if you actually meet me in person, I’m not too bad of a dude, I don’t think.</p>
<p>While it’s fair to ask for more privacy when you live most of your job in the public spotlight, that same spotlight is what allows golfers to have careers in the first place. With the story of his rant at the cameraman making news, perhaps DeChambeau should have worried more about that damaging his brand than someone doing their job.</p>

Bryson DeChambeau answers one of golf’s hardest questions as only he can</p>

<p>Golf, the International Golf Federation writes, might have begun in 100 B.C. The Romans played paganic, in which players hit a stuffed leather ball with a bent stick.</p>
<p>Golfers have been searching for perfection for 2,100 years.</p>
<p>Golfers will continue to search, Bryson DeChambeau said this week.</p>
<p>DeChambeau has perhaps tried as hard as any golfer over those millenia. He’s embraced the math and science behind the game. Even with his own body. Over the past year, he’s put on upward of 40 pounds, including 15 pounds over the PGA Tour’s recent three-month hiatus due to the coronavirus, in the search of adding more distance.</p>
<p>DeChambeau has gone low. Entering Saturday’s third round of the Rocket Mortgage Classic, where he entered one shot out of the lead, he hasn’t shot above par in the 14 rounds since the Tour’s return. DeChambeau just will never go low low.</p>
<p>“No. Well, from a human perspective, like it’s probably impossible,” DeChambeau said when asked if golf can be perfected.</p>
<p>“If you had a robot out here calculating all the variables, I think you could potentially get really close to perfection, but from a human perspective, there’s no way to understand all the wind. The wind is the biggest variable, and the grass length is the second biggest variable that we just don’t have control over and never will.”</p>
<p>Perfection, technically, would be an 18 – 18 holes, 18 holes in one, 54-under on a par-72.</p>
<p>It’s a concept so fictional that even a fictional movie joked about it. In one of the fight scenes in “Captain America: Civil War,” Clint Barton, or Hawkeye, is about to engage Tony Stark, or Iron Man. Hawkeye, as his moniker suggests, doesn’t miss. Anywhere.</p>
<p>“Clearly retirement doesn’t suit you,” Stark says to Barton. “Got tired of shooting golf?”</p>
<p>“Well, I played 18, shot 18,” Barton responds. “Just can’t seem to miss.”</p>
<p>Perfection, likely, would be a 50 on a par-72 with four par-3s, 10 par-4s and four par-5s – birdies on the par-3s, birdies on the par-4s and eagles on the par-5s. According to the Guiness Book of World Records, the lowest golf score over an 18-hole course is a 55, on a par-71, by Rhein Gibson in 2012. (Gibson is also in the field this week for the Rocket Mortgage.) The lowest score on the PGA Tour is Jim Furyk’s 58, which he shot on the par-70 at TPC River Highlands during the final round of the 2016 Travelers Championship.</p>
<p>The question of perfection even goes back a while. In 1959, Sports Illustrated asked 14 players. The answers were the same as DeChambeau’s.</p>
<p>“If you mean the perfect game within the realm of probability, maybe it will be played,” Arnold Palmer said. “That would mean hitting 18 perfect tee shots and 18 perfect second shots and landing in the cup in no more than one or two putts. But no one is ever going to birdie 18 holes.”</p>
<p>Of course, as 2,100 years have shown, players keep trying. There’s thrill in the chase.</p>
<p>“My job is just to be more consistent and if I can keep being more repeatable, have my dispersion be a little less as I’m hitting it farther, there’s a lot of strokes to be gained there,” DeChambeau said.

<p>DETROIT &ndash; Bryson DeChambeau pounded protein shakes and lifted iron to transform his body, adding 40 pounds of mass, and changed his game to put a premium on power.</p>
<p>The plan is working.</p>
<p>With jaw-dropping drives and some clutch putts, DeChambeau won the Rocket Mortgage Classic by three strokes Sunday for his first victory of the season and sixth overall. He became the first PGA Tour player since 2004 to lead a tournament in driving distance, along with shots gained off the tee and putting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a little emotional for me because I did do something a little different,&rdquo; the 26-year-old DeChambeau said. &ldquo;I changed my body, changed my mindset in the game and I was able to accomplish a win while playing a completely different style of golf. And, it&rsquo;s pretty amazing to see that. I hope it&rsquo;s an inspiration to a lot of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeChambeau shot a 7-under 65 at Detroit Golf Club, birdieing four of the first seven holes and closing with three straight. He finished at a career-best 23-under 265.</p>
<p>Matthew Wolff (71) was second. He started the day with a three-shot lead and hurt his chances with five bogeys over his first 10 holes. Kevin Kisner (66) finished another stroke back as part of a relatively weak field that continued to trend of exceptional play since the PGA Tour restarted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of play on tour in these first four weeks has been incredible, cuts at 4 and 5 under every week,&rdquo; Kisner said.</p>
<p>With a strong finish, DeChambeau removed all doubt that he would win the second Rocket Mortgage Classic.</p>
<p>He made a 30-foot birdie putt at No. 16, which he said was his shot of the day. He also had a short putt for birdie on the next hole. And finally, he uncorked a 367-yard drive to set up another short putt at 18.</p>
<p>DeChambeau came into the week with six straight top-eight finishes and was the only player with top 10s in the first three events after the restart from the coronavirus pandemic. He won for the first time since the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in November 2018.</p>
<p>DeChambeau has dramatically altered his body, packing about 240 pounds on his 6-foot-1 body, and took advantage of the extra time he had to work on his physique during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He understands what is the key to gaining the biggest advantage and that&rsquo;s distance, and mega distance,&rdquo; Kisner said. &ldquo;He just has too much time on his hands. He needs to start getting married and having kids and feel like the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeChambeau&rsquo;s power was on full display in the Motor City with drives that went 351 yards on average after looking like he might swing out of his spikes.</p>
<p>When DeChambeau was on the tee box at the 399-yard, par-4 13th, he waited for the next group to leave the green before hitting his drive so that he didn&rsquo;t hit any fellow competitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never done that,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;I really could have gotten there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His drive on the 621-yard, par-5 fourth went way left and landed in greenside rough on an adjacent hole. He cleared towering trees and landed just short of the green, sending his approach 276 yards and he two-putted from 37 feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was probably my second best moment of the day,&rdquo; DeChambeau said. &ldquo;I got really quite honestly pretty lucky being able to get over these trees and let it land and roll onto the front edge of the green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his body and power becomes a fixation for those who follow golf, more eyes are on him and it bothered him during the third round.</p>
<p>On Saturday, DeChambeau had a testy exchange with a TV cameraman after a bogey on the sixth hole. After the third round, he bristled that it isn&rsquo;t right showing a potential vulnerability and hurting someone&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>DeChambeau, though, tried to soften his stance on the issue Sunday by saying the cameraman was just trying to do his job.</p>
<p>During the final round, he was also briefly distracted by a commotion outside the course.</p>
<p>While a Black Lives Matter protests was gathering outside the Detroit Golf Club, breaking the silence of the fan-free event with chants and air horns, DeChambeau took some time to reset before hitting a 366-yard drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s a lot of strife and trouble going on right now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I love that everybody&rsquo;s voicing their opinion and I think that they deserve to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re golfers here trying to provide the best entertainment. I think that&rsquo;s the most important thing that we can do.&rdquo;

“Sorry, Mr. Ross.”</p>
<p>Yeah, right</p>
<p>Two days after entertaining media with that amusing crack, Bryson DeChambeau showed little contrition dismantling the Donald Ross layout Thursday at the aptly named Rocket Mortgage Classic. He showed little remorse blowing so many drives over the bunkers Ross intended to defend his design.</p>
<p>DeChambeau filled the sky over Detroit Golf Club with one missile after another while getting into early contention.</p>
<p>He slammed seven drives of more than 340 yards on his way to a 6-under 66 that left him one shot behind the leaders, Kevin Kisner, Doc Redman and Scott Stallings.</p>
<p>DeChambeau launched a 376-yard drive at the 14th hole, setting up eagle there.</p>
<p>He beat that with a 377-yard drive at the 17th, where he made birdie.</p>
<p>He averaged a staggering 345 yards per drive on the back nine.</p>
<p>Still, the round of eight birdies, an eagle and four bogeys didn’t satisfy him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t good enough.</p>
<p>“I’m, again, trying to be the casino and give myself the best opportunity to win,” he said.</p>
<p>That’s why he called his effort a “B-game” afterward.</p>
<p>“It’s not 100 percent, but it’s not bad, either,” he said.</p>
<p>The numbers he is popping into ShotLink continue to be head spinning. His ball speed hitting driver reached 196.8 miles per hour at 14th.</p>
<p>He’s like a tank equipped with a Ferrari engine.</p>
<p>He left himself a 9-iron into more than one par 5.</p>
<p>He leads the field in strokes gained: putting and is second in strokes gained: off the tee.</p>

<p>Still, this 26-year-old won’t be satisfied until he has turned his grand experiment into a victory.</p>
<p>After putting on 40 pounds of strategic girth since last fall, and remaking his technique to harness the new-found power, he has yet to win. He has yet to claim his sixth PGA Tour title, his first since the fall of 2018, but he has been knocking hard on the door since the PGA Tour’s restart a month ago. He has racked up T-3, T-8 and T-6 finishes over the last three weeks. He has put up scores of 66 or better eight times over the last 13 rounds, but he isn’t “The Casino” yet.</p>
<p>That’s why missing six fairways and four greens was still bugging him when he left scoring following Thursday’s round.</p>
<p>“Very frustrated about some of the decisions we made and some of the shots I executed,” DeChambeau said. “I just felt like I hit really good shots that just didn&rsquo;t get rewarded today. Driver got a little wayward a couple holes. Need to go clean that up, like always.”</p>
<p>Flying the 18th green with a wedge and closing with a bogey particularly bothered him.</p>
<p>“That really got me a little agitated,” DeChambeau said. “It’s going to put a little fire in my belly for tomorrow. I feel like I&rsquo;m in a good place. It&rsquo;s fun to be able to play good golf not having your A game.”</p>
<p>DeChambeau left the course motivated to find that next level.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m always trying to find a little something to make me hit it more consistently straight, but if I can keep hitting it straight, hitting some greens and making the putts like I am, it&rsquo;s going to be a fun week,” he said.

July 5 (UPI) &ndash; Bryson DeChambeau earned his first victory of the season and sixth overall after winning the Rocket Mortgage Classic by three strokes Sunday at the Detroit Golf Club.</p>
<p>DeChambeau &ndash; the only player with top-10 finishes in each of the past three events entering this week&rsquo;s tournament &ndash; shot a 7-under 65 in the final round, recording birdies on four of the first seven holes and closing with three straight.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old golfer, who has added about 40 pounds since late last year, finished at a career-best 23-under 265. It was his first win since the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in November 2018.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little emotional for me because I did do something a little different,&rdquo; DeChambeau told reporters. &ldquo;I changed my body, changed my mindset in the game and I was able to accomplish a win while playing a completely different style of golf. It&rsquo;s pretty amazing to see that and I hope it&rsquo;s an inspiration to a lot of people that if they set their mind to it, you can accomplish it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just takes a lot of hard work, a lot of figuring out things that you may not know and understand yet, but if you keep going down the line and you keep working on it, figuring stuff out, eventually you&rsquo;ll get a little bit better each and every day and hopefully that leads to something great in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matthew Wolff started the final round with a three-shot lead but hurt his chances with five bogeys across his first 10 holes. He shot a 71 and finished second at 20-under 268.</p>
<p>Kevin Kisner (66) came in third at 18-under 270. Danny Willett, Adam Hadwin, Tyrrell Hatton and Ryan Armour tied for fourth at 16-under 272.</p>
<p>Rickie Fowler finished in a tie for 12th at 14-under 274. Scott Stallings &ndash; who was tied for the Round 1 lead &ndash; ended up in a tie for 39th at 11-under, while Tony Finau closed with a 9-under 279 for a share of 53rd.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour&rsquo;s next event is the Workday Charity Open, which will begin Thursday. The tournament will be the first of back-to-back events at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, and will feature seven of the top 15 players in the world.
