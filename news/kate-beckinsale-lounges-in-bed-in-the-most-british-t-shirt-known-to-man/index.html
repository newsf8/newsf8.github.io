Kate Beckingsale has been in lockdown mode with boyfriend Goody Grace amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But on Thursday the Underworld star, 46, and her new musician beau, 23, decided to make a break outside to enjoy some of the Southern California sun during a shopping excursion.</p>
<p>And with the number of confirmed cases in the Golden State currently on a dangerous spike in recent weeks, the loved-up couple both wore protective masks as they packed on the PDA during their stroll down the street.</p>
<p>Break out: Kate Beckinsale, 46, and new beau Goody Grace, 23, took a reprieve from their COVID-19 quarantine to do a little shopping in Los Angeles on Thursday</p>
<p>The pair, who were first spotted out in public together in April, put their affection for each other on display by holding hand almost the entire time.</p>
<p>The London-born actress showed off her casual-cool look in tight black denim jeans and a black pinstripe blazer over a white t-shirt.</p>
<p>She rounded out her ensemble with a pair of black-pointed boots and her brown tresses styled long with some soft and subtle waves.</p>
<p>Grace, who&rsquo;s a native of Canada, strutted his rocker style in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles in all black that consisted of tight denim jeans, t-shirt, jacket and Converse sneakers.</p>

<p>In another show of affection, the couple would often turn to each other and share some seductive looks, all while continuing to hold hands.</p>
<p>Beckinsale kept her eyes hidden behind a pair of dark sunglasses, but Grace couldn&rsquo;t hide his obvious infatuation for his lady by not donning any eyeglass wear.</p>
<p>The Canadian musician (born Garrett Charles Nash) carried a brown shopping bag all all the way until they reached their car, hopped in, and drove away.</p>
<p>Chatty: The pair seemed to be engaged in a conversation the entire time of their walk</p>

<p>In recent days, the Van Helsing star clapped back at a troll who questioned her taste in younger men.</p>
<p>When one Instagram follower asked, &lsquo;Why do you keep dating guys that could be your children?&rsquo; she shot back with a heavy dose of attitude: &lsquo;every relationship I have had has been solely to annoy you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actress went on to target followers who asked if she was bored and &lsquo;had too much time on her hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I’m rarely on other people’s Instagrams with unoriginal comments, so, no,&rsquo; she responded.</p>
<p>A source told People that Beckinsale &lsquo;enjoys Grace&rsquo;s company, and that she finds him &lsquo;very mature, smart and creative.&rsquo; The source went on to reveal that the couple have been dating since the beginning of the new year.</p>

<h3 id="watch-kate-beckinsale-portrays-freddie-mercury-in-instagram-tribute-to-queens-i-want-to-break-free-video">&ldquo;WATCH: Kate Beckinsale Portrays Freddie Mercury in Instagram Tribute to Queen’s ‘I Want to Break Free’ Video&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kate-Beckinsale.jpg" alt="img">
Kate Beckinsale has marked Pride Month in a super-fun way, by recreating Queen’s classic “I Want to Break Free” video on Instagram.</p>
<p>Released in 1984, the original video saw the four members of Queen – Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon – dress in drag to portray women loosely based on female characters from the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street.</p>
<p>In her Instagram remake, Beckinsale emulates Mercury’s distinctive look from the video – complete with wig, false breasts, and a handlebar moustache – while vamping it up in the style of the late Queen frontman.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three of her friends emulate the characters portrayed by May, Taylor, and Deacon. She shared the remake over two Instagram posts that you can check out below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCAEG2yDn4B/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CCAEG2yDn4B/</a></p>
<p>Though Queen’s “I Want to Break Free” video is fondly membered today, it was considered somewhat controversial at the time, as May recalled in a 2010 interview.</p>
<p>“So we’re dressing up as girls, as women, and we had a fantastic laugh doing it. It was hilarious to do it. All around the world people laughed and they got the joke and they sort of understood it,” May told NPR Radio. “I remember being on the promo tour in the Midwest of America and peoples’ faces turning ashen and they would say, ‘No, we can’t play this. We can’t possibly play this. You know, it looks homosexual.’”</p>
<p>So in a way, the fact that the video is viewed so warmly today is a poignant reminder of how far LGBTQ rights have come over the last 36 years. As Beckinsale wrote in her original post, “Happy Pride!”</p>
<p>What do you think of Kate Beckinsale’s Freddie Mercury impression?

“It can feel like a little bit of a political act to be a woman over 32 who’s having any fun at all,” she said, clarifying, “I don’t mean doing drugs and drinking and partying, because I never am, but being goofy, and going out, and not going, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to sit home and anticipate menopause while crocheting.‘”

<p>Paloma: I should have started family earlier</p>
<p>PALOMA Faith has opened up about her regret at not having kids earlier after struggling to conceive through IVF.</p>

<p>Asked what age she would like to go back to, she said: “Twenty eight, and I’d have a baby because I think that’s the perfect age to have a child. I think I left it too late. I just think 28 is perfect because you’ve had enough of your twenties, you’re not past it.</p>
<p>“Once you’ve had it and your recovery time is like a year, you’re still in your twenties and you can start rocking out and going at it career-wise at 29.”</p>
<p>Paloma who is in a long-term relationship with artist Leyman Lahcine, was speaking on an Instagram Live where she also revealed she feels too “self aware” to have a threesome.</p>
<p>On whether she had ever had one, she said: “No and I really don’t want one. It’s not one I regret. I don’t want a threesome because I’m too self aware.</p>
<p>“I’d find it awkward. I’d find it hard not to make jokes.” Sounds like a real hoot.</p>

<p>He told the At Home With The Williamses podcast: “That was January. By February I was morbidly obese. I looked like a farm animal as it was quoted in the press in 1996, ‘Mr Kipling is a b*d’.”</p>

<p>JUSTIN Bieber has filed a £16million lawsuit against two women who accused him of sexual assault, days after denying one of the claims and saying it was “factually impossible”.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit filed this week Justin says the women, named only as Danielle and Kadi, “fraudulently schemed to seek attention by maliciously posting blatantly false, fabricated, defamatory accusations” on Twitter.</p>
<p>He is seeking about £16million in damages.</p>
<p>But as the allegations made by Danielle did not give any personal information other than her first name, he will have to track her down first.</p>
