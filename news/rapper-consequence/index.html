<p>Buddy, photo by Jack Mckain</p>
<p>Terrace Martin, Kamasi Washington, and Denzel Curry have released their own protest song in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, as has Lil Baby. Rising Compton rapper Buddy is joining the conversation today with his own single, but his message is slightly different.</p>
<p>On “Black 2”, the rising rapper calls out those who like to appropriate and profit from Black culture. He specifically addresses people who have the privilege of never having to actually deal with the stigma of being Black and those who remain silent about racism in America. “Everybody tryna get dreads and shit, but they ain’t African/ All the light girls gettin’ the tan so they can darken they skin,” raps Buddy.</p>
<p>During the chorus, the former Vince Staples tour mate makes his missive even clearer: “Grew up in the west, bumpin Dogg, Pound and Jigga/ Everybody wanna be black, don’t nobody wanna be a ni**a.” The track also includes mentions of Spike Lee and Malcolm X. Stream “Black 2” in full below.</p>
<p>“Black 2” is the sequel to “Black”, a 2018 ASAP Ferg collaboration that appeared on Buddy’s Harlan &amp; Alondra debut album. In recent months, Buddy filmed a Tiny Desk Concert for NPR, as well as dropped a collaborative mixtape with Kent Jamz. The Calfornia rapper, who is also part of the Zoink Gang supergroup featuring Smino, J.I.D., and Guapdad 4000, appeared on J. Cole’s Revenge of the Dreamers III compilation album last summer.</p>

Ice Cube, photo by Philip Cosores</p>
<p>Since the murder of George Floyd spurred a nationwide uprising of police brutality protests, Ice Cube’s music, specifically N.W.A.’s “Fuck Tha Police”, has felt extremely on-point. His tweets, on the other hand, have not: the veteran rapper and actor has been uploading images promoting anti-Semitic and Russian propaganda.</p>
<p>On June 6th, Ice Cube tweeted an image of a mural that was removed from a wall in London’s East End for being anti-Semitic. The picture features a handful of caricatured Jewish businessmen playing a game of Monopoly on top of a table that sits on the backs of black men. The image itself contains the words, “All we have to do is stand up and their little game is over.”</p>
<p>Earlier today, he shared a picture of a black cube in the center of the Jewish Star of David. The purported meaning behind it is extremely convoluted, but it stems from a conspiracy that the three major religions, including Judaism, are influenced by shapes on the surface of the planet Saturn. Many people in Ice Cube’s comments are expressing disgust, but the ones who are praising him are posting other images that suggest that the “black box” is some sort of code that unlocks a massive conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for events such as 9/11 and the pandemic.</p>
<p>Also today, the N.W.A. rapper posted a meme that claims the noses of ancient Egyptian statues were shot off by Europeans. As The Daily Beast reports, the meme was made by “Black Matters”, a “website and Facebook page that purports to be a non-profit news resource for African-Americans but was outed long ago as a Russian-run propaganda tool to manipulate Americans.” According to CNN, that claim about the statues is untrue, they were in fact damaged long, long ago by “soon-to-be rulers who were rewriting their own history.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear what motivated Ice Cube’s problematic Twitter streak. It’s especially surprising given that the other tweets on his page as of late have been distinctly anti-Trump, anti-racist, and/or pro-black. There’s a slight possibility he doesn’t “get” why these images are inherently problematic. After all, he did tweet a picture of a banner that says “Media is complicit” alongside the letter “Q”, only to later claim he was unaware of the letter’s association to QAnon, the pro-Trump conspiracy theory that suggests there’s a secret deep state that’s constantly plotting against our current president.</p>
<p>Sadly, Ice Cube isn’t the only hyper-political musical figure to completely contradict his music’s message in recent days. System of a Down drummer John Dolmayan has been sharing his support for Donald Trump and criticizing police brutality protests, an extremely hard pivot from the anti-police, anti-racist metal music he made his career off of.

Emma Lee</p>
<p>As protests against racism, police brutality, and white supremacy continue to sweep the nation, Emma Lee’s rallying new single “Hugo Pinell (MOSH)” could not have come at a better time.</p>
<p>On the track, the Uganda-born, New York-raised rapper sparks a revolution, inviting others to join her in overthrowing oppressors of all kinds. “No matter what they did/ I wouldn’t quit/ Now we got a like-minded mosh pit/ We got an army full of tactics/ And the strike is all ready like a matchstick,” says Lee with conviction.</p>
<p>“It’s on you to decide, but choosing nothing is the same thing as choosing sides,” adds Lee, echoing current sentiments that silence can be equated to violence and complicity. The entire boils over during the chorus, where Lee powerfully declares, “We alive, organize, let’s MOSH when you can’t take no more!”</p>
<p>According to a statement, the new song was partially named for Hugo Pinell, the last jailed member of the “San Quentin Six”. Proceeds from the track will go to “the grassroots and 501(c)3 nonprofit community work of Hugo Pinell’s daughter in youth &amp; family services, community advocacy, homelessness, economic empowerment &amp; anti-racism efforts.”

<p>As promised less than 24 hours ago, Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs and veteran producer The Alchemist have released their new collaborative album, Alfredo. Dig in and stream it below via Apple Music or Spotify.</p>
<p>Comprised of 10 songs, the delectable effort features special guests in Tyler, the Creator (“Something to Rap), Rick Ross (“Scottie Beam”), Conway the Machine (“Babies &amp; Fools)”, and Benny the Butcher (“Frank Lucas”). It marks the second joint release from Gibbs and The Alchemist following their 2018 mixtape Fetti.</p>
<p>The pair initially teased Alfredo with “1985”, a soulful single peppered with curling guitars. On the track, the Indiana rapper name-dropped both Michael Jordan and Joe Pesci. Meanwhile, its corresponding Nick Walker-directed video closed out with footage of an American flag engulfed in flames — a rather coincidentally apt image given the recent news out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>For Gibbs, today’s new project comes less than a year after Bandana, his stellar joint release with Madlib.</p>

<h3 id="10-albums-by-hip-hop-duos-that-every-music-fan-should-own">&ldquo;10 Albums by Hip-Hop Duos That Every Music Fan Should Own&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Eric-B-Rakim.jpg?quality=80" alt="img">
Crate Digging is a recurring feature in which we take a deep dive into a genre and turn up several albums all music fans should know about. As a new Run the Jewels album drops this week, we look at a rich history of records by hip-hop duos.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that hip-hop is only about 47 years old, give or take a year or two. So many memories, iconic figures, highs, lows … the genre brings about a wealth of emotion, regardless of one’s demographic. As hip-hop has grown, so has its sound, its reach, as well as its influence on popular culture. But during its infancy, the rapper and the DJ were the perfect marriage between two musicians of different crafts blending together to make a singular sound. Hip-hop “crews” were more prevalent early on, but there was something about the duo that audiences were drawn to more than any other dynamic. Now, the individual seems to have risen to the top of the ranks, but there have been and still are some amazing duos in rap.</p>
<p>On June 5th, the rapper/producer team of Killer Mike and El-P will officially release the fourth installment of Run the Jewels. The group, which goes by the same name, represents what many people consider the essence of hip-hop — the emcee and the DJ. The digital age has transformed that into the “rapper and the producer,” but the concept remains. Proverbs 27:17 states that “Iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.” The same could be said about two musicians coming together for a common cause.</p>
<p>In anticipation of Run the Jewels 4, we’ve compiled a list of 10 albums by hip-hop duos that every fan should be privy to. Whether it be two rappers or a rapper and a producer, the final product is undeniable. A combination of different coasts, older releases, and more contemporary classics, these albums are crucial to anyone who enjoys hip-hop and a testament to why the genre (and the hip-hop duo) is here to stay.</p>

<h3 id="tekashi-6ix9ine-and-nicki-minaj-collaborate-on-new-single-trollz-stream">&ldquo;Tekashi 6ix9ine and Nicki Minaj Collaborate on New Single “Trollz”: Stream&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tekashi-trollz-stream-song-new-music-release-minaj.jpg?quality=80" alt="img">
Nicki Minaj and Tekashi 6ix9ine</p>
<p>Tekashi 6ix9ine and Nicki Minaj have unveiled a new collaborative single called “Trollz”. Stream the new release below.</p>
<p>A portion of the proceeds from the song, as well as its corresponding merchandise, will benefit The Bail Project. “The fund provides free bail assistance to low-income individuals who can’t afford to pay bail while awaiting their trial,” Minaj explained on social media. “We want to protect and support the thousands of brave people working on the front lines of social justice, using their voices to demand AN END to the targeting and killing of Black Americans by the police.”</p>
<p>For Tekashi, today’s offering marks his second comeback single since being released early from prison due to the coronavirus; revisit last month’s “GOOBA” here. The rapper had originally been sentenced to 24 months behind bars after pleading guilty to racketeering, firearm possession, and drug trafficking charges. That lenient plea deal came as a result of his cooperation — or snitching, as others have called it — with the prosecution.</p>
<p>As for Minaj, she previously featured on Doja Cat’s “Say So” remix from May. That release helped Minaj land her first-ever No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p>
<p>Tekashi and Minaj linked up once before, on 2018’s “Fefe”. For the pair, “Trollz” makes for an interesting choice in song title, as they’ve each been accused of online trolling. Most recently, Tekashi trolled Snoop Dogg and attempted to start a social media feud with Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber.

<h3 id="dr-dre-thinks-social-media-destroyed-the-artist-mystique">&ldquo;Dr. Dre Thinks Social Media Destroyed the Artist Mystique&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dr.-Dre-British-GQ.jpg?quality=80" alt="img">
Dr. Dre (British GQ)</p>
<p>No wonder Dr. Dre doesn’t post much online. In a new interview with Jimmy Iovine in British GQ, the prolific rapper said he thinks social media has “destroyed” the artist mystique by offering fans too much access into the life of musicians, reports NME.</p>
<p>Dre and Iovine’s conversation primarily revolved around how digital fame plays a role in an artist’s success nowadays. “I probably would’ve hated social media when I was coming up,” said Dre. “There’s a certain mystique that gets destroyed. I like the mystique. I like waiting. I don’t need anybody to know where I am every minute or what I’m doing. Or what I’m about to do… There’s a certain mystique that came along with music that was entertaining to wait to see what was about to happen.”</p>
<p>From there, Iovine took Dre’s opinion and stretched it even farther. The rapper’s longtime friend and business partner questioned how social media would have impacted the great musical acts of the past. “If Michael Jackson had Instagram, would he have ended up healthier?” said Iovine. “Who knows.”</p>
<p>“I think what’s happened is, ‘great’ was never behind fame as much as it is now. Fame is what the currency is.
