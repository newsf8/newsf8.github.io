Supermarket opening times for NHS workers: Dedicated Asda, Tesco and Morrisons opening hours during the UK coronavirus outbreak</p>
<p>With the UK on lockdown, special measures have been introduced to help NHS staff get access to the essential items that they need</p>
<p>By Rhona Shennan Friday, 27th March 2020, 5:21 pm Updated Friday, 27th March 2020, 5:22 pm</p>
<p>These are the special shopping times for NHS staff (Photo: Shutterstock)</p>
<p>Some chains have created special shopping hours for elderly people, hired more staff to stock shelves and have limited the number of items each person can buy.</p>
<p>Now, alongside special hours for elderly and vulnerable shoppers, supermarket chains have started to introduce similar “golden hours” for NHS staff, upon presenting their NHS ID.</p>
<p>Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting&hellip;</p>
<p>This is what you need to know.</p>
<p>Tesco</p>
<p>NHS staff will be allowed to do their shopping for an hour ahead of usual opening hours on Sundays upon displaying their NHS employee card.</p>
<p>This is only available at Tesco’s larger stores and not their Express stores.</p>
<p>A statement from the supermarket brand said: “We know that those working for the NHS may be finding it hard to find time to shop for their groceries at the moment.</p>
<p>“So, from this Sunday, we’re going to introduce a special hour in stores for NHS staff as a thank you for all they are doing.”</p>
<p>The statement also asked their customers to be respectful of this and to shop during usual opening hours.</p>
<p>Sainsbury’s</p>
<p>Sainsbury’s have introduced their dedicated shopping slot for NHS staff and social care workers, between 7:30am and 8am, Monday to Saturday.</p>
<p>A statement from Sainsbury’s said that anyone with an NHS ID would be allowed to shop during this time.</p>
<p>Asda</p>
<p>In Asda’s larger stores, priority access will be allotted to NHS workers every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8am to 9am.</p>
<p>Asda CEO, Roger Burnley, said: “We all have a clear responsibility to look after each other during this crisis, particularly our most vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>“I was heartened to see how our customers respected this priority access and am proud to be able to extend it to more regular days and also include our amazing NHS colleagues who can access our stores with a little more ease.”</p>
<p>Morrisons</p>
<p>Morrisons does not have a specific shopping hour for elderly and vulnerable shoppers, but will give NHS staff early access to their stores between 7am and 8am every day apart from Sundays.</p>
<p>A statement from the supermarket chain said: “It is really important that we stick to this to help support out vital services at a time when they are going to need us the most.”</p>
<p>M&amp;S</p>
<p>NHS workers will be given priority access to M&amp;S shelves on the first hour of Tuesday and Fridays.</p>
<p>The statement from M&amp;S regarding checking ID’s said: “We will ask NHS and emergency services workers to show their staff passes or other relevant ID such as a Blue Light Card.</p>
<p>“Of course, in this unprecedented time our colleagues may not be able to always check ID and we’re relying on our customers to respect this request.”</p>
<p>Waitrose</p>
<p>While Waitrose aren’t setting aside a specific time for NHS workers to do their shopping, they are setting aside “hard-to-find” and “essential products” exclusively for NHS staff, on production of an NHS card.</p>
<p>Waitrose also said that they would be giving NHS staff priority on their checkout service, to ensure that they can get their shopping done as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Aldi</p>
<p>Aldi announced recently that they are introducing dedicated shopping times for Emergency Workers.</p>
<p>Aldi will open between 9:30am and 10am on Sundays (and 8:30am and 9am in Scotland) soley for key workers in the NHS, Police and Fire Service.</p>
<p>These customers will also take priority at checkouts when they open at 10am.</p>
<p>Entry to Aldi stores during this time is dependent on relevant ID.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/750x445/1260746.jpg" alt="img">
Morrisons is endeavouring to meet the demand for its home delivery slots. Online shopping for groceries is more important than ever as the government has ordered everyone to remain at home to help slow the spread of the killer infection. What time is Morrisons opening during the coronavirus outbreak?</p>
<p>Supermarket chains around Britain have been working hard to meet with demand.</p>
<p>Retailers have said there is no shortage of supply, but stores have been stripped bare because of panic buying.</p>
<p>Shops have said the issue is due to the expediency with which items are leaving the shelves.</p>
<p>In order to meet with this demand, retailers have adapted their retail offerings to meet with changing consumer behaviours.</p>
