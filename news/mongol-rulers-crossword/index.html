<p>In Mulan: Rise of a Warrior, Zhao Wei plays Hua Mulan – a character that may have been based on real ancient female warriors Credit: Collection Christophel/Alamy © Starlight International Media Group</p>
<p>Ancient remains found in the Mongolian steppe suggest that the story of the female warrior Mulan may have been inspired by real Xianbei women who rode horseback and probably also used bows and arrows.</p>
<p>According to folklore, a powerful East Asian ruler demanded every family send one man to swell the ranks of his army, and a girl named Mulan faced a difficult choice: either let her weak father go to war, …

<h3 id="north-koreas-leaders-have-vanished-from-view-before--and-reappeared">&ldquo;North Korea’s leaders have vanished from view before — and reappeared&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/334bca2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+225/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2F20%2Ff864eb51a21afac099243f4755fc%2F1a1a52b1445f4869b87c7d71311f943b" alt="img">
While North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s two-week absence has inspired speculation and rumors that he is gravely ill, he is not the first member of the hermetic country’s ruling elite to disappear from public view.</p>
<p>Some absences were caused by real trouble, including deaths, illness or purges. But frequently the so-called disappearances have simply shown the disconnect between insatiable curiosity about what’s happening inside the isolated, nuclear-armed nation and the thick cloak of secrecy surrounding its leadership.</p>
<p>A look at past cases of missing North Korean officials and when reports about the demise of leaders were premature:</p>
<p>Kim Il Sung</p>
<p>Before his death in 1994, there was arguably no person South Koreans hated and feared more than North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung. His forces launched a surprise attack on the South in June 1950, triggering a devastating war that drew massive intervention by the United States and China and killed and injured millions of people before an armistice halted fighting three years later.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He also dispatched commandos in a failed attempt to assassinate the South Korean president in 1968 and sent agents to plant bombs that killed 21 people, including several South Korean Cabinet ministers, during a presidential visit to Myanmar in 1983.</p>
<p>When South Korean newspapers reported him as dead in November 1986, the public, at least for a few hours, was overwhelmed with euphoria but also panic about instability on the border.</p>
<p>The reports began circulating Nov. 16 when the Chosun Ilbo published a short story by its Tokyo correspondent reporting rumors in Japan that Kim had died. Things took a strange turn the next day when South Korea’s military spokesman announced that the North Koreans used loudspeakers on the mine-strewn border to announce that Kim had been shot to death.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Chosun released an extra edition to report the story on Nov. 17 — a Monday when newspapers hadn’t usually published — before using seven pages to describe Kim’s assassination on Nov. 18, under the now-infamous front-page headline “Kim Il Sung shot dead.”</p>
<p>Other newspapers wrote similar stories, adding to a frenzy that abruptly ended hours later when Kim appeared alive and well at an airport in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, to greet a visiting Mongolian delegation.</p>
<p>Chosun, South Korea’s biggest newspaper by circulation, never published a correction. But it formally apologized over the story last month while marking the 100th anniversary of its founding.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The newspaper also apologized over a 2013 report that said North Korean singer and senior ruling party member Hyon Song Wol had been executed. Hyon reappeared in public in May 2014 and is now considered one of the most powerful women in North Korea, accompanying Kim Jong Un to several international summits.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il, the famously reclusive son of Kim Il Sung and father of the current ruler, also was the subject of countless reports and rumors of his demise.</p>
<p>In 2004, a massive explosion at a North Korean train station on its border with China inspired rumors of an assassination attempt, as he had passed through hours earlier on his way back from Beijing. The collision of two fuel-carrying trains reportedly killed and injured thousands of people, but a link to the leader’s travel was never confirmed.</p>
<p>Chatter about Kim Jong Il’s death following his 2008 stroke became so frequent that it prompted South Korea’s financial regulator in 2009 to investigate whether the rumors were being deliberately spread to manipulate stock markets.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>When Kim did die in December 2011, following years of deteriorating health and diminishing public appearances, the outside world had no clue until the North’s state media announced it two days later.</p>
<p>His once-powerful sister, Kim Kyong Hui, has had her own share of premature reports about her death. CNN in May 2015 cited a North Korean defector in reporting that current leader Kim Jong Un had had his aunt poisoned to death. But the 73-year-old made her first public appearance in about six years in January, sitting near her nephew during a concert.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un</p>
<p>Conflicting reports over the past week have said Kim Jong Un is either “gravely ill,” “in a vegetative state” or “perfectly fine” following heart surgery that may or may not have happened.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In 2014, Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. South Korea’s spy agency said he had had a cyst removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>In 2016, South Korean media quoted intelligence officials as saying Kim had had a former military chief executed for corruption and other charges. But months later, North Korea’s state media showed Ri Yong Gil alive and serving in new senior posts.</p>
<p>Kim was last seen in public April 11 when he presided over a ruling party meeting on coronavirus prevention. Unusually, he missed the April 15 anniversary celebration of his late grandfather Kim Il Sung’s birth for the first time since taking power in 2011. State media have since reported his engagement in routine, but non-public activities. They say he’s sent greetings to the leaders of Syria, Cuba and South Africa and expressed gratitude to citizens of merit, including workers building tourist facilities in the coastal town of Wonsan, which is where some speculate he is staying.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>While it’s possible that Kim could pop up anytime, continuing a family tradition of resurrections, some experts say that his health will become an increasing factor in years ahead, considering his weight, smoking habits and other supposed health problems.

<h3 id="in-uzbekistan-coming-to-terms-with-the-countrys-dazzling-history">&ldquo;In Uzbekistan, Coming to Terms With the Country’s Dazzling History&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/17/t-magazine/17tmag-uzbekistan-slide-LP4D/17tmag-uzbekistan-slide-LP4D-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
The Silk Road is our supreme metaphor for the interplay between commodities and ideas — and, as an extension, the interplay between the intangible and the concrete. On my first day in Tashkent, I encountered an object that remade my idea of the history of the place. I had not, until then, thought of Tashkent as a great Islamic capital — not like Istanbul, Cairo or Baghdad, say — but in the small Muyi Mubarak Library at Hazrati Imam, at the heart of old Tashkent, surrounded by ribbed azure domes swimming up against a pale sky, I saw what had to be among the wonders of the Islamic world: the oldest Quran in existence (best estimates date it to the eighth century). There it was, its swollen pages of gazelle skin inscribed with the bold black letters of the Kufic script. It had been the private Quran of the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, and it was Timur — the “scourge of God” in Christopher Marlowe’s play “Tamburlaine the Great” — who, having laid siege to the civilized world in the 14th century, brought it from what is now Iraq to his capital at Samarkand. Its presence in Tashkent was a reminder that if one was to do justice to the history of Uzbekistan, one would have to make a mental separation between the modern state — an unremarkable Central Asian republic with an autocrat at its helm — and the many worlds this land had been part of. The state was new, the land was eons old. It had once comprised Sogdiana and parts of Transoxania; it had been a point of confluence between Iran and Turan, the line between Persianate and Turkic cultures; the famous regions of Khorasan and Khwarezm were all part of what the land had known. It had produced a roll call of polymaths, from the scholar and scientist Al-Biruni to Ibn Sina, known to the West as Avicenna (980-1037), one of the fathers of early medicine. The creator of the algorithm — al-Khwarizmi (circa 780-circa 850) — had been part of the same flowering of genius that had made this land one of the centers of thought and discovery, as had the philosopher Alpharabius, or al-Farabi (circa 878-circa 950). This was the kingdom of the astronomer-king Ulugh Beg, whose 15th-century work was being translated into English and Latin in the years following the Renaissance.</p>
<p>This land of many natures — Turkic and Persian, upon which Russian had been grafted — expressed itself in Aziz, too. One moment he was talking of Lenin and Stalin and quoting Aleksandr Pushkin’s 1833 novel in verse, “Eugene Onegin,” the next he was discussing the history of Islam and recalling whole quatrains of the 11th-century Persian poet and astronomer Omar Khayyam’s “Rubaiyat.” This was the place where one needed to come to understand how distinct cultures graded into one another. It was not so much a melting pot as a hologram, and this felt true of religious values, too: This was an Islamic country where everyone drank vodka and where the Soviet government, in the Communist years, had closed some 26,000 mosques; there were just 80 open in 1989. But Islam had had its revenge, too. In a bookshop on the main square, Aziz pointed to a pamphlet that showed pictures of Lenin’s statue being torn down as it warned against idolatry.</p>
<p>Aziz himself had undergone something of a Damascene un-conversion. Madina remembered him as being very religious, praying five times a day and talking endlessly about the Quran. “But then,” Aziz said, “I turned on my logic.” He was now positively scornful of religious people, arguing with them about contentious subjects such as why, if Islam was a religion of peace, had it gone everywhere “by sword and fire.”

Hello, my name is John Cherwa and welcome back to our horse racing newsletter as we try and contemplate how what happened on Saturday will affect the business.</p>
<p>The news about Mongolian Groom’s death certainly placed a cloud over this year’s Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita. It’s a story that will not likely go away for a while. You can find information about it on our website and in the print edition. Just click here.</p>
<p>Breeders’ Cup capsules</p>
<p>Once again, we’ve enlisted Jay Posner of the San Diego Union-Tribune to do our Breeders’ Cup capsules. So, here we go.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>FILLY &amp; MARE SPRINT</p>
<p>What happened: Trainer Brad Cox said he wasn’t worried about the rail post for Covfefe, and the filly showed why as she settled just off the pace and then rallied to become only the second 3-year-old to win this race. The daughter of Into Mischief had been dominant against her age group this year, winning all four of her starts, but she lost her only try against older. On Saturday the 3-2 favorite had to hold off another 3-year-old, Bellafina, who suffered her first loss in five races at Santa Anita. It was Cox’s second win of the weekend and his third ever in the Breeders’ Cup, while jockey Joel Rosario won for the 10th time.</p>
<p>Did you know? As you might have suspected, Covfefe was named after the famous tweet from President Donald Trump. Owner Jaime Roth of LNJ Foxwoods (which also co-owned Kentucky Derby winner Country House) credited Ruben Mendez of Santa Anita’s marketing department for reserving the name after the tweet.</p>
<p>Quote: “This moment right now is the best moment I’ve ever had as a horse owner and, I mean, this is what it’s all about, being on this stage, winning the championship race of the category your horse is in.” – Roth</p>

<p>TURF SPRINT</p>
<p>What happened: The same thing that always happens in this race … trainer Peter Miller won. Stormy Liberal, who had won this race for Miller the last two years, faded to eighth, but Miller’s other two starters finished 1-2: Belvoir Bay and Om. Neither had run since June but the winner trained steadily at San Luis Rey Downs in Bonsall and the runner-up arrived there a few weeks ago. They were 1-2 for virtually the entire five furlongs, with Belvoir Bay finishing in a track-record time of 54.83 seconds. The win was the fifth overall for Miller in the Breeders’ Cup, and the second of the weekend and 11th overall for jockey Javier Castellano.</p>
<p>Did you know? Om, a 7-year-old, also finished second in this race the last time it was at Santa Anita, in 2016.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Quote: “When we made the lead like that, I didn’t look at the fractions because I know this filly, she’s tough as nails. She’s 900 pounds soaking wet, and it’s all heart. She’s unbelievable.” – Miller</p>
<p>You can watch it here.</p>
<p>DIRT MILE</p>
<p>What happened: The surprise wasn’t that a 3-year-old won this race; the surprise was which 3-year-old. Instead of even-money favorite Omaha Beach, the 9-1 longshot Spun to Run flew out of the gate and was never seriously challenged in a 2¾-length win. Omaha Beach was almost eight lengths behind with a quarter-mile remaining and out-finished the rest of the field but Spun to Run probably didn’t even know he was in the race. The son of Hard Spun had finished third in the Haskell this summer behind Maximum Security but his biggest win had come in a Grade 3 race. Jockey Irad Ortiz won for the second time this weekend and seventh overall.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Did you know? Winning trainer Juan Carlos Guerrero had started only one horse in a Breeders’ Cup, finishing seventh in the 2011 Filly &amp; Mare Sprint.</p>
<p>Quote: “He had a bad break from the gate that probably cost us a couple of lengths. As importantly, it also cost us position. Then, I had to wait, wait, wait and kept losing position. When he got clear at the three-eighths pole, the horse in front was long gone. Hats off to the winner, but I think I rode the best horse today.” – Omaha Beach jockey Mike Smith.</p>

<p>FILLY &amp; MARE TURF</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>What happened: The Europeans got their first win of this Breeders’ Cup with another major upset. Defending champion Sistercharlie, who hadn’t lost in six races since June 2018, could do no better than third as the Irish-bred Iridessa out-finished California hopeful Vasilika by a neck. The race was a strange one, with the long-shot Mirth opening a nine-length lead after three-quarters of a mile. But Vasilika and Iridessa tracked her in second and third, moved past her in the stretch and then dueled to the wire before Iridessa gave jockey Wayne Lordan and trainer Joseph O’Brien their first Cup win. It was only Vasilika’s second defeat in 13 races at Santa Anita.</p>
<p>Did you know? Winning trainer O’Brien already was the youngest jockey to win a Breeders’ Cup race; he was 18 when he rode St. Nicholas Abbey to victory in the 2011 Turf for his father, the legendary Irish trainer Aidan O’Brien. Eight years later he earned similar honors as the youngest trainer, knocking out Craig Dollase (who was 27 when Reraise won the 1998 Sprint).</p>
<p>Quote: “It’s very special. Obviously I’ve been coming here a number of years, and I know how hard it is to compete here.” – O’Brien</p>

<p>SPRINT</p>
<p>What happened: Mitole left no doubt as to the best sprinter in the country, chasing down Shancealot in the stretch to earn his sixth win in seven starts this year. Four of those wins came in Grade I races, putting Mitole at least in the conversation for Horse of the Year. The win was the first in the Breeders’ Cup for jockey Ricardo Santana Jr., who sat patiently a few lengths behind Shancealot after a blazing opening half-mile of 44.04 seconds. Santana began to move on the turn and got the lead inside the final 50 yards, eventually winning by 1 ¼ lengths. Trainer Steve Asmussen won his seventh Cup race (and first Sprint).</p>
<p>Did you know? Mitole joined Gulch (1988) as the only horses to win the Met Mile and the Breeders’ Cup Sprint in the same year.</p>
<p>Quote: “For him to get to the Met Mile and perform the way that he did against that field on that stage, stretched out, and then for him within a matter of months to retrack, to reset, to be the fastest horse in the world over three-quarters of a mile – good luck anybody trying it. It’s out there. Go prove it.” – Asmussen</p>

<p>MILE</p>
<p>What happened: Disappointed two races ago when Sistercharlie failed to win her second consecutive Filly &amp; Mare Turf, trainer Chad Brown got better results from another 5-year-old mare, Uni. And, for the second time in 24 hours, Brown was able to celebrate winning a Cup race he had never won (Friday it was the Juvenile Turf). Uni was far back early, as usual, and when she began to move on the far turn, it seemed like she blew past about half the field in a few strides. She went six-wide into the stretch and out-finished favored Got Stormy in the final 100 yards. It was Brown’s 14th Cup win and the 11th for Joel Rosario.</p>
<p>Did you know? Uni won for the seventh time in eight starts at the distance, including last fall’s Matriarch at Del Mar. She became the 10th filly or mare to win the Mile.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Quote: “Joel fits her so well. Hats off to him. Obviously, he’s a world-class jockey and has won a lot of races, but the relationship between him and this horse is about as strong as you can get.” – Brown</p>

<p>DISTAFF</p>
<p>What happened: Any chance Midnight Bisou might have had of joining the likes of Zenyatta and Rachel Alexandra as a filly to win Horse of the Year ended when she could only manage a runner-up finish behind Blue Prize. ‘Bisou was the second even-money favorite to finish second on the day, joining Omaha Beach (Dirt Mile), who also was ridden by Mike Smith. The two horses were within a half-length of each other with a half-mile to run, but while Blue Prize quickened going into the turn, Midnight Bisou didn’t really get going until about a quarter-mile remaining. Jockey Joe Bravo picked up his first Cup win – 28 years after the first of his 21 mounts (and with his only mount this weekend).</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Did you know? Trainer Ignacio Correas IV is from Argentina, where his family began breeding race horses in 1872. He came to the United States in 2002 and this was just his third Cup starter (including Blue Prize last year). In fact, it was just his third Grade I win, all with this mare.</p>
<p>Quote: “Nothing Midnight Bisou does for us is disappointing. She had a tremendous amount to overcome with all the dirt she took early. A quality filly beat her and got first run on her around the turn. It took Mike quite a bit to get her out (and) that just left her too much to do.” – Asmussen</p>

<p>TURF</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>What happened: Bricks and Mortar likely wrapped up Horse of the Year honors by completing an undefeated season with a thrilling victory in the final turf race of the weekend. In fact, it was probably a bit too thrilling for jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., who was in tight quarters for much of the race, especially the first time past the grandstand in the 1½-mile race. But Ortiz was able to get settled, and the even-money favorite finally got clear coming out of the turn into the stretch. He was able to run down the 50-1 long-shot United and win by a head to give Brown and Ortiz two wins each on the day and three for the weekend.</p>
<p>Did you know? In the Breeders’ Cup era (which started 1984), just four times has a horse earned Horse of the Year honors while racing predominantly on turf: John Henry (1984), Kotashaan (1993) and Wise Dan (2012-13). Apropos of nothing, Kotashaan, Wise Dan and, presumably, Bricks and Mortar all clinched their titles at Santa Anita.</p>
<p>Quote: “This is the biggest win of my career and the biggest for my team, for sure. He has a lot of guts. What an awesome horse. We’re so, so fortunate he’s in our barn.” – Brown</p>

<p>CLASSIC</p>
<p>What happened: In a race in which Mongolian Groom broke down at the top of the stretch, Vino Rosso repeated his victory from five months ago in the Gold Cup at Santa Anita, but this time for 12 times the $500,000 purse available in late May. The winner was fourth through much of the race, made a big move on the turn, swept past favored McKinzie at the top of the stretch and won going away. It was the first Breeders’ Cup Classic victory and 11th Cup win overall for trainer Todd Pletcher. Jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., who picked up the mount before Vino Rosso’s last race when John Velazquez chose Code of Honor, won his third Cup race of the day, fourth of the weekend and ninth overall.</p>
<p>Did you know? Curlin, the sire of Vino Rosso, won the 2007 Classic at Monmouth Park, beating among others, Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense, the sire of McKinzie.</p>
<p>Quote: “This is unbelievable. Indescribable. We’ve won so many graded stakes, but this one feels different. Winning with Uncle Mo (2010 Juvenile) was amazing and I knew it would take a special race to get a feeling even bigger than that. This is the one. This is the pinnacle.” – owner Mike Repole</p>

<p>Santa Anita review</p>
<p>There were three non-Breeders’ Cup stakes on Saturday, all bunched up at the beginning of the card.</p>
<p>Grade 3 $100,000 Ken Maddy Stakes: Just Grazed Me hung around toward the back until the top of the stretch when she unleashed a powerful rally going three deep to win the 5 ½ furlong turf race for fillies and mares by 1 ¼ lengths. Just Grazed Me paid $7.40, $4.00 and $2.80. Apache Princess was second and Ippodamia’s Girl finished third.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Here’s what the winning connections had to say.</p>
<p>Phil D’Amato (winning trainer): She’s kind of actually changed her style more and more herself. She’s coming from further behind with a bigger kick. … She’s just finding her groove right now. It’s really nice to see a filly develop like this and hopefully have a bright future ahead of her.”</p>
<p>Geovanni Franco (winning jockey): “We broke nice and she settled into a good spot. There were some really fast fillies in there [Saturday]. She just does what she does and took off on the turn. Once she pinned her ears back, there was no way they were going to catch her.”</p>
<p>$100,000 Damascus Stakes: This race lost a lot when Horse Greedy scratched leaving just four horses. Comical Ghost went to the lead but couldn’t hold it in this seven furlong race. Flagstaff put his head in front at the top of the stretch and held off Roadster to win by nose. Flagstaff paid $4.00 and $2.40. There was no show betting. Extra Hope was third and Comical Ghost finished fourth.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Here’s what the winning connections had to say.</p>
<p>John Sadler (winning trainer): “What a great start. Can I count this as a Breeders’ Cup win? I’ll count it for the day. … He had all kinds of stuff [happen to him]. He had colic at 3 and he had been injured several times. When he runs, he’s a really good horse, but just had things not go right for him. He looks the soundest he’s ever been and is doing really well, so we’re excited.</p>
<p>Victor Espinoza (winning jockey): “He ran a big race and he fought all the way to the wire. He definitely didn’t want to… get beat [Saturday]. [The trip] was great. It worked out well. For a minute I thought it was going to be a little complicated. Then the horse in the front kind of split up so I had a little more of a chance to control there. … We want to get this horse better. John [Sadler] is an excellent trainer. He knows how to prepare third horse for the best.”</p>
<p>Grade 2 $200,000 Twilight Derby: Under a masterful ride by Joel Rosario, Mo Forza came from fifth at the three-quarters mark in this 1 1/8 mile race for 3-year-olds to take the lead in mid-stretch and win by 1 ¾ lengths. Mo Forza paid $39.60, $17.60 and $8.00. Succeedandsurpass was second and Neptune’s Storm finished third.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Here’s what the winning connections had to say.</p>
<p>Peter Miller (winning trainer): “I just told Joel [Rosario] to get a position. … The pace was a little slower than I thought, but he was loaded the whole way. The horse was throwing his head but then Joel got him to settle.</p>
<p>Joel Rosario (winning jockey): “he was a little rank leaving the gate, but I had him in hand. He was pulling, but not that bad. He relaxes really well on the first turn and settled into racing. This was a special win for me, since it was for Barry Abrams. When I came down from Northern California, it was Barry who gave me my first opportunity and I won for him.”</p>

<p>Let me have your attention. First post is at 11:30 a.m. Repeat, 11:30 a.m. It’s a nine-race card that has a tough act to follow after two Breeders’ Cup days. Five of the races are for maidens, there are four turf races and there is one stakes, the Grade 2 $200,000 Goldikova Stakes for fillies and mares going a mile on the turf.</p>
<p>Toinette is the 6-5 favorite for trainer Neil Drysdale and jockey Flavien Prat. She is six-for-nine lifetime and two of three this year. She has won three or her last five including the Grade 3 Autumn Miss Stakes. Prat returns to he saddle after an absence of tow races.</p>
<p>The second favorite, at 3-1, is Ms Bad Behavior for Richard Baltas and Drayden Van Dyke. She is four-for-18 lifetime with her last win coming two back at Kentucky Downs in a Grade 3. She has two wins and six second sin 10 turf races at Santa Anita.</p>

<p>Ciaran Thornton’s SA pick of the day</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>RACE ONE: No. 8 Truest Reward (8-1)</p>
<p>Truest Reward is a Doug O’Neill/Rafael Bejarano horse and they are 47% at the meet. Ran second last out under Abel Cedillo who is on suspension today. This is his first time on grass but grass is in the bloodlines with the dam having five winners from six starters including two on turf. 8-1 is great value although I doubt we get this excellent price. First time routing and a big jump in class today.</p>
<p>Saturday’s result: Shakky Shebaz was bet down to 5-1, third favorite and ran great given the huge jump in class. The horse sat third throughout the race and looked like he had a chance into the stretch but alas ran third. Make a note of this horse next out.</p>

<p>FOURTH RACE: No. 2 Ratification (3-1)</p>
<p>This Rainbow Futurity finalist worked super in 12.1 gate drill last October 19 while preparing for first start in 14 weeks. She galloped out with powerful strides after reaching out nicely midway in outworking her company by nearly two lengths. She qualified for the Rainbow Futurtity by virtue of a one-half length trial victory at tonight’s 400-yard distance.</p>

<h3 id="this-pandemic-isnt-the-first-time-the-hajj-has-been-disrupted-for-muslims">&ldquo;This Pandemic Isn’t the First Time the Hajj Has Been Disrupted for Muslims&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/K1ODHnrgjTzaftkw54kRsCbiAWI=/fit-in/1600x0/filters:focal(3536x1430:3537x1431)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/58/f2/58f273dd-a506-4102-9b99-20779808e6bf/gettyimages-1205430202.jpg" alt="img">
Saudi Arabia has urged Muslims to delay their plans for the hajj, amid speculation that the obligatory pilgrimage may be canceled this year due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Saudi authorities halted travel to holy sites as part of the umrah, the “lesser pilgrimage” that takes place throughout the year.</p>
<p>Canceling the hajj, however, would mean a massive economic hit for the country and many businesses globally, such as the hajj travel industry. Millions of Muslims visit the Saudi kingdom each year, and the pilgrimage has not been canceled since the founding of the Saudi Kingdom in 1932.</p>
<p>But as a scholar of global Islam, I have encountered many instances in the more than 1,400-year history of the pilgrimage when its planning had to be altered due to armed conflicts, disease or just plain politics. Here are just a few.</p>
<p>Armed conflicts</p>
<p>One of the earliest significant interruptions of the hajj took place in A.D. 930, when a sect of Ismailis, a minority Shiite community, known as the Qarmatians raided Mecca because they believed the hajj to be a pagan ritual.</p>
<p>The Qarmatians were said to have killed scores of pilgrims and absconded with the black stone of the Kaaba—which Muslims believed was sent down from heaven. They took the stone to their stronghold in modern-day Bahrain.</p>
<p>Hajj was suspended until the Abbasids, a dynasty that ruled over a vast empire stretching across North Africa, the Middle East to modern-day India from A.D. 750-1258, paid a ransom for its return over 20 years later.</p>
<p>Political disputes</p>
<p>Political disagreements and conflict have often meant that pilgrims from certain places were kept from performing hajj because of lack of protection along overland routes into the Hijaz, the region in the west of Saudi Arabia where both Mecca and Medina are located.</p>
<p>In A.D. 983, the rulers of Baghdad and Egypt were at war. The Fatimid rulers of Egypt claimed to be the true leaders of Islam and opposed the rule of the Abbasid dynasty in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>Their political tug-of-war kept various pilgrims from Mecca and Medina for eight years, until A.D. 991.</p>
<p>Then, during the fall of the Fatimids in A.D. 1168, Egyptians could not enter the Hijaz. It is also said that no one from Baghdad performed hajj for years after the city fell to Mongol invasion in A.D. 1258.</p>
<p>Many years later, Napolean’s military incursions aimed at checking British colonial influence in the region prevented many pilgrims from hajj between A.D. 1798 and 1801.</p>
<p>Diseases and hajj</p>
<p>Much like the present, diseases and other natural calamities have also come in the way of the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>There are reports that the first time an epidemic of any kind caused hajj to be canceled was an outbreak of plague in A.D. 967. And drought and famine caused the Fatimid ruler to cancel overland Hajj routes in A.D. 1048.</p>
<p>Cholera outbreaks in multiple years throughout the 19th century claimed thousands of pilgrims’ lives during the hajj. One cholera outbreak in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in 1858 forced thousands of Egyptians to flee to Egypt’s Red Sea border, where they were quarantined before being allowed back in.</p>
<p>Indeed, for much of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, cholera remained a “perennial threat” and caused frequent disruption to the annual hajj.</p>
<p>So did the plague. An outbreak of bubonic plague in India in 1831 claimed thousands of pilgrims’ lives on their way to perform hajj.</p>
<p>In fact, with so many outbreaks in such quick succession, the hajj was frequently interrupted throughout the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>Recent years</p>
<p>In more recent years, too, the pilgrimage has been disrupted for many similar reasons.</p>
<p>In 2012 and 2013 Saudi authorities encouraged the ill and the elderly not to undertake the pilgrimage amid concerns over Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS.</p>
<p>Contemporary geopolitics and human rights issues have also played a role in who was able to perform the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>In 2017, the 1.8 million Muslim citizens of Qatar were not able to perform the hajj following the decision by Saudi Arabia and three other Arab nations to sever diplomatic ties with the country over differences of opinion on various geopolitical issues.</p>
<p>The same year, some Shiite governments such as Iran leveled charges alleging that Shiites were not allowed to perform the pilgrimage by Sunni Saudi authorities.</p>
<p>In other cases, faithful Muslims have called for boycotts, citing Saudi Arabia’s human rights record.</p>
<p>While a decision to cancel the hajj will surely disappoint Muslims looking to perform the pilgrimage, many among them have been sharing online a relevant hadith—a tradition reporting the sayings and practice of the prophet Muhammad—that provides guidance about traveling during a time of an epidemic: “If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; but if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place.”</p>
