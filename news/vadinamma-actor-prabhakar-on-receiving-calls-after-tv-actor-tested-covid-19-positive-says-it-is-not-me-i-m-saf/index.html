<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76544078,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-158979/76544078.jpg" alt="img">
After a TV actor reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 , the Artistes Association of Telugu Television (AATT) has directed all the TV actors to stop shooting for their shows.AATT President Vinod Bala has communicated the same to the members of the association a few hours ago. Telugu Television Producers Council (TTPC) is scheduled to meet at 11 AM today (June 24) to discuss the current shooting scenario and a decision is likely to be announced soon.Speaking to ETimes TV about the same, President Vinod Bala, said, &ldquo;All the actors are panic-stricken after learning about a TV actor testing positive for COVID-19. So we at AATT, have decided to stop attending TV shoots, discuss with the Producers Council the various aspects involved in shooting amid the crisis situation and take some key decisions that will benefit everyone in the long term.&ldquo;He adds, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve personally spoken to the actor who was tested positive. He is feeling low and is worried about the treatment as well as the expenses. I assured him that the Artistes Association will stand by him and that he need not worry. We are confident that he did not contract the disease on the shooting sets. He came from Tirupati and he might have developed symptoms during the journey. However, he participated in nearly 3 TV shootings and all the 120 members who were involved are currently worried. They must take COVID-19 tests at the earliest.&ldquo;Elaborating on the issues to be discussed in the meeting with the Producers Council, Vinod Bala said, &ldquo;Right from reviewing the sanitising procedures, involving actors from other states to deciding on the medical insurance for the actors, technicians and arriving at a consensus on the compensation to be given to the deceased, we are keen upon finding long term solutions for the issues involved.&ldquo;Replying to the question on the delay in discussing the above, Bala said, &ldquo;Right from crew members to many actors, many were badly affected by the lockdown and the financial situation commanded the decision to start shootings as soon as we were permitted to resume work. But now when it finally hit our family, everyone is naturally worried. In a way, this is a wake up to chalk out long term solutions in the interest of everyone.&rdquo;

Popular daily soap Prema Entha Madhuram , which often keeps fans entertained with its compelling storytelling, is going to witness something unexpected.As per the current storyline, Anu’s mother tries to use Aryavardhan to convince Anu for marriage. However, Anu, who wants to find out Aryavardhan’s marital status, is ignorant of her mother’s intent. Now, the upcoming episode will see Anu mother’s inviting Aryavardhan for dinner and he will readily agree to ignore the pre-scheduled team dinner. Jhende, Aryavardhan’s confidant, will confront and question him about the same. He will even ask Arya if he is doing this for Anu and this is a rarity.It remains to be seen what Aryavardhan is really up to. Aryavardhan and Anu have feelings for each other which they haven’t confessed yet and the recent episodes have seen the story progressing towards a major revelation. Anu wants to know if Aryavardhan, who is much older than her, is married. On the other hand, he was reluctant to state his marital status in Anu’s slam book as well.Prema Entha Madhuram, which is the official remake of Kannada show Jothe Jotheyali, fared well on the TRP charts before the lockdown. The makers have recently resumed airing fresh episodes post lockdown.
