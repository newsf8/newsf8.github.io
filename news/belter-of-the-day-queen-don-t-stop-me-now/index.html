Belter Of The Day: Queen - Don&rsquo;t Stop Me Now</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight, I&rsquo;m gonna have myself a real good time&hellip;&rdquo; Freddie Mercury&rsquo;s pure expression of joy.</p>
<p>There were many, many sides to Queen. From the mystical worlds of Seven Seas Of Rhye to the dramatic opera of Bohemian Rhapsody. The heavy rock of Hammer To Fall to the white funk of Another Ones Bites The Dust. Name a genre and Queen probably had a crack at it.</p>
<p>Having each of the four members write songs was a key to the variety and ingenuity of the band, allowing different tastes and influences to sink into their work.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t Stop Me Now was written by the charismatic frontman Freddie Mercury at a time in his life when hedonism was king. As Brian May later told MOJO magazine, that the song depicts a time when the singer was &ldquo;taking lots of drugs and having sex with lots of men&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Written in the luxurious surroundings of Montreux, Switzerland, for Queen&rsquo;s seventh studio album, Jazz, the song is an honest expression of life, fun and having a good time, good time. As the theatrical opening states, the singer is literally &ldquo;floating around in ecstasy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m burnin&rsquo; through the sky, yeah!&rdquo; cries Freddie as the song reaches full pelt. &ldquo;Two hundred degrees, that&rsquo;s why they call me Mr Fahrenheit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely, seeing as it&rsquo;s now one of Queen&rsquo;s most popular tunes, Don&rsquo;t Stop Me Now only reached number 9 in the UK charts on its release in January 1979. In the US, it barely scraped into the Billboard Top 100, stalling at #86.</p>
<p>America hadn&rsquo;t fully come to terms with the flamboyant ways of Freddie Mercury, or their tongue-in-cheek excess - at the time, Rolling Stone called Queen &ldquo;the first truly fascist rock band&rdquo;.</p>
<p>No matter. Don&rsquo;t Stop Me Now is now a stone cold classic from the Queen catalogue and has appeared in countless TV ads, talent shows and movies. Edgar Wright used it to back a zombie attack in the comedy Shaun Of The Dead, saying it &ldquo;Seemed their most obvious showstopper to me. Perfect for killing zombies.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1261154.jpg" alt="img">
The Queen is currently self-isolating at Windsor Castle with Prince Philip as their ages have put them in a high-risk group of catching coronavirus. The 93-year-old monarch is incredibly vulnerable due to her age as the British public are desperate for her to pull through this pandemic. Prince Charles is said to have last seen the Queen a day before be became infectious.</p>
<p>Speaking on New Idea&rsquo;s ROYALS podcast, royal expert Angela Mollard said: &ldquo;None of us know how long this is going on for. &ldquo;I think the most worrying thing is that we do have an elderly Queen. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s 93, 94 shortly and of course Prince Philip at 98. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very vulnerable apart from a virus of this nature.

<p>&ldquo;You just have to hope they get through it. &ldquo;After a reign of this magnitude, you just hope that the Queen pulls through. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously brilliant she&rsquo;s in isolation at Windsor. &ldquo;But certainly the British people will rely on her at the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="queen-remains-in-good-health-and-last-saw-boris-johnson-16-days-ago">Queen &lsquo;remains in good health&rsquo; and last saw Boris Johnson 16 days ago</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/27/12/26484260-0-image-a-21_1585311916854.jpg" alt="img">
The Queen remains in good health and last saw Boris Johnson 16 days ago, royal aides said today after the Prime Minister tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>The 93-year-old monarch, whose son Prince Charles also has the infection, is said to be &lsquo;following all the appropriate advice with regards to her welfare&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: &lsquo;Her Majesty the Queen remains in good health. The Queen last saw the Prime Minister on March 11 and is following all the appropriate advice with regards to her welfare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Boris Johnson (left, at 10 Downing Street in London) and the Queen (right, at Windsor Castle) speak together on the phone during their weekly audience, on Wednesday</p>
<p>After the audience on March 11, their following meeting held on March 18 was conducted via telephone - as have their subsequent conversations.</p>
<p>Photographs released earlier this week showed Mr Johnson and the Queen speaking on the phone from 10 Downing Street and Windsor Castle respectively.</p>
<p>Prince Charles has been working at his desk &lsquo;as usual&rsquo; despite testing positive for coronavirus on Tuesday. He is said to be suffering from only &lsquo;mild&rsquo; symptoms.</p>
<p>He and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who has tested positive, are living separately at Birkhall, their Scottish mansion, in self isolation.</p>
<p>The Prince became the highest profile coronavirus case in the country earlier this week, after Clarence House said he had tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The Queen welcomes Boris Johnson to Buckingham Palace in July last year after his election</p>
<p>Royal aides said he has received hundreds of get well soon messages since his diagnosis was released, a mixture of cards and digital messages.</p>
<p>It is understood that his doctors believe that it is unlikely to escalate into a more serious case.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace have declined to comment on whether the Queen has been tested as the prince met her privately less than two weeks previously, on March 12.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Queen thanked frontline NHS workers in a tribute posted on the Royal Family&rsquo;s Instagram page.</p>
<p>The Queen and Prince Charles, who tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday, leave after the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey in London on Commonwealth Day on March 9</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;We are enormously thankful for the expertise and commitment of our scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children Lady Louise Windsor and Viscount Severn, also clapped after Edward paid tribute to workers.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;So from all of us just a huge thank you to so many of you working on the frontline - you&rsquo;re really appreciated keep up the fantastic work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and their staff all separately joined in with a round of applause at Birkhall in Scotland.
