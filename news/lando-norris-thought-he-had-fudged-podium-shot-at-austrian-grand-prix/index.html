<p>Lando Norris secured his first F1 podium, and Nate Saunders was pleased to see the McLaren driver succeed. (1:31)</p>
<p>McLaren&rsquo;s Lando Norris thought he had blown his chance at his first Formula One podium at the Austrian Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Norris claimed third position at the Red Bull Ring by just 0.1 seconds after Lewis Hamilton was demoted down the order with a five-second penalty right after the race. The F1 sophomore, 2019&rsquo;s rookie of the year, barged past Racing Point&rsquo;s Sergio Perez in the closing stages after a spell of weathering pressure from McLaren teammate Carlos Sainz.</p>
<p>The British driver admitted he felt the podium opportunity slipping away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were a few points where I thought I&rsquo;d fudged it up a bit,&rdquo; he said immediately after the race. &ldquo;I dropped to fifth with a few laps to go, Carlos was almost going to get past me. But I didn&rsquo;t give up and I managed to get past Perez and ended up on the podium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s a long race, but I kept going and kept giving my all, [I had] a pretty cool last few laps trying to push as much as I can. I am a bit out of breath, but I am so happy and proud of the team.</p>
<p>Lando Norris doused himself with champagne on the podium at the Austrian Grand Prix. Mark Thompson/Getty Images</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering where we were a few years ago to now, I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good achievement, so I&rsquo;m proud to be part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Norris claimed the podium by setting the fastest lap of the race on the last lap, he was not sure</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last few laps, when I had to get past Checo, I knew he had a five-second penalty but nothing more than that,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always seemed to struggle when I was close to the cars ahead and more vulnerable to the guys behind. So I knew &ndash; not just because of Lewis, because I didn&rsquo;t know at the time [he had a penalty], I knew I had to try to get past him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then when the Lewis penalty came, I knew I had to turn it up a little bit.&rdquo;

F1: McLaren&rsquo;s Lando Norris claimed a stunning third place at the Austrian GP, his first ever podium finish. It&rsquo;s fair to say he was pretty pumped!</p>
<p>Life is looking bright at McLaren after Lando Norris secured his first ever podium and Carlos Sainz finished fifth as the F1 season finally started in Austria.</p>
<p>Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) and Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) crossed the line first and second respectively in the opening race of 2020, which arrived several months after the scheduled start in Melbourne was cancelled because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>McLaren was the big mover in 2019, establishing itself as the midfield leader ahead of Renault by coming fourth in the constructors’ championship and the team has started on a cheerful note this season.</p>
<p>Norris was overcome with emotion and his reaction to a maiden top-three finish was gold, dropping a seriously loud “f*** yeah!” over the team radio.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old wasted no time celebrating with McLaren chief Zac Brown, who gave his young driver a big bear hug after he jumped into the boss’s arms.</p>
<p>“He hugged me so tight, pretty sure he broke my rib,” Norris told Sky Sports. “I’m in a bit of pain.”</p>
<p>Celebrations are a bit different to what F1 fans are used to in this world of social distancing but Norris still made his first shake of the champagne bottle one to remember, cracking it on the ground and spraying Bottas and Leclerc before turning his attention to his thirsty engineers.</p>
<p>Norris became the third-youngest driver ever and the youngest Brit to score a podium in F1, and he did so by pulling out the fastest lap of the race on his final tour of the circuit to pip Lewis Hamilton, who was relegated to fourth after receiving a five-second penalty for an incident with Red Bull’s Alex Albon.</p>
<p>Norris surged past Sergio Perez late to cross the line within five seconds of Hamilton and scrape into the top three of a wild race that saw nine drivers fail to finish.</p>
<p>“Oh my god. Insane,” Norris said as he re-watched footage of his blistering last lap during an interview with Sky. “That’s why you need big balls.</p>
<p>“We took every opportunity we could with other people making mistakes and clashing and getting penalties.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day that was the thing which won it for us, was not giving up and taking those necessary risks.</p>
<p>“I only knew Hamilton was going to get a penalty with a couple of laps to go.</p>
<p>RELATED: Six F1 drivers choose not to kneel</p>
<p>“So it was only after (passing) Perez I knew I needed to really start to push. I only did it by two tenths. One small lock-up, one mistake that I could have made, or just our pace not being quite as good as it was, and I wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p>“Proud of what we have achieved as a team. Fourth (in qualifying) we were very happy with — we were over the moon with. We knew it was going to be very difficult to achieve anything like that today but we went one better.</p>
<p>“I’m very happy. I got a nice little trophy as well, the first one for a couple of years.”</p>
<p>Aussie Daniel Ricciardo will be feeling let down after an engine failure cut his race short but he will at least be heartened to see McLaren perform strongly.</p>
<p>Ricciardo is leaving Renault at the end of the season to team up with Norris at McLaren in 2021, after Carlos Sainz was snapped up by Ferrari.</p>
<p>Ricciardo is yet to stand on the podium with Renault but after what we saw from McLaren in Austria, he’ll be hopeful of tasting some champagne himself as soon as possible next year.

Lando Norris secured a career-best fourth place in qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix on Saturday – and no one was more surprised than the McLaren driver himself, who said he and his team had not expected to &ldquo;get close” to the Racing Point cars which had looked so quick in practice.</p>
<p>The RP20 car being driven by Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll has been dubbed ‘the pink Mercedes’ thanks to it’s similarities to last year’s championship winning car, and it appeared to have the pace to match after strong showings in practice at the Red Bull Ring.</p>
<p>But when it mattered in qualifying, Perez was sixth with Stroll in ninth, with Norris ahead of both of them in fourth place.</p>

<p>“For sure I think we had our expectations of where we thought we wanted to be and from the very beginning the Racing Points have clearly been extremely quick. We never thought we&rsquo;d be in a chance of beating them or getting close to them,” Norris said.</p>
<p>But the 20-year-old Briton said the McLaren MCL35 started to come to him once qualifying got underway on Saturday.

Mclaren driver Lando Norris took a friendly shot at teammate Carlos Sainz regarding the latter’s move to Ferrari. Norris jokingly acknowledged the Spaniard’s move to Ferrari, claiming he was “surprised”.</p>
<p>Lando Norris “very surprised” with Sainz’s move to Ferrari</p>
<p>The Carlos Sainz- Lando Norris bromance is one of the biggest things fans will miss in 2021. However, with Sainz heading to Ferrari, the comical duo won’t be providing us with wholesome content next season.</p>
<p>Sainz and Norris share a special relationship that’s not very common in Formula 1. Teammates aren’t always jovial with each other, but with Lando and Carlos, it’s different. The pair got along like gin and tonic during their first season as teammates.</p>
<p>It was this friendly dynamic between Carlos and Lando, which gave Mclaren a strong lineup. Friends off the track, Lando and Carlos were still competitive when it was time to race.</p>
<p>The perfect balance between rivalry, respect, and friendship is what made the pairing great. Sadly, it’ll be coming to an end after this season. Sainz is switching to Ferrari, with Daniel Ricciardo taking his place.</p>
<p>Speaking at the pre-race press conference, Lando reflected on the latest developments.</p>
<p>“very,” said Norris, when asked if he was surprised by Carlos moving to Ferrari in 2021.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think he had what it takes, to be honest” replied Norris cheekily.</p>
<p>“Someone was going to replace him and whoever it was, it was going to be a bit of a surprise”</p>
<p>“Cause I didn’t think there was going to be any other drivers in the top 3 team moving around at all,”</p>
<p>“So yeah, I knew it was obviously going to be someone and I knew at that point that Carlos was obviously going to be on the radar”</p>
<p>“he was one of the guys which I knew could have a chance”</p>
<p>The British driver believes Sainz deserves the Ferrari drive, given his excellent performances in 2019.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m very happy for him, he drove very well last year” concluded Norris.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/30/21/30237850-0-image-a-8_1593547430772.jpg" alt="img">
McLaren will leave British youngster Lando Norris to decide for himself whether he &lsquo;takes a knee&rsquo; alongside his compatriot Lewis Hamilton at this weekend&rsquo;s Austrian Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Norris&rsquo; boss Zak Brown, who supports Formula One&rsquo;s new &lsquo;#raceasone&rsquo; initiative, said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what our drivers will do, Lando or Carlos (Sainz).. It&rsquo;s a big topic and everyone around the world comes to it with different views and experiences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not for me or the team to tell them what to do or not to do. It is their decision. They will do what they think is best.&rsquo; The likelihood is that all the drivers will follow Hamilton&rsquo;s lead by making a symbolic anti-racism statement at the Red Bull Ring, home of the season&rsquo;s first race.</p>
<p>Lando Norris will be allowed to make the decision on whether to &lsquo;take a knee&rsquo; this weekend</p>
<p>Norris, 20, said: &lsquo;Some of the drivers have already been talking about taking a knee. If we are going to do it, we should all do it as a grid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be discussed with the Grand Prix Drivers&rsquo; Association on Friday. We will do whatever we can to show that we care and respect everyone. We will do what is right when the time comes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This sport reaches millions of people and the more we can do as drivers, teams and as the F1 community, the bigger the impact we can have.&rsquo; All the cars will carry the &lsquo;End Racism&rsquo; message, while the Mercedes of Hamilton and team-mate Valtteri Bottas will have a predominantly black livery, rather than the usual silver, as a statement against inequality.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s season-opening round is the first of two races at the Red Bull Ring on consecutive weeks, before the travelling contingent moves to Hungary and then to Silverstone for two races next month (Aug).</p>
<p>All the opening events will take place behind closed doors.

<p><img src="https://d3cm515ijfiu6w.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02193813/PA.44046451.jpg" alt="img">
Two-time World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi has tipped Lando Norris to succeed Lewis Hamilton as Britain’s racing megastar.</p>
<p>Hamilton heads into the 2020 season searching to make history – one more title will make him a seven-time World Champion, putting him level with Michael Schumacher at the top of Formula 1.</p>
<p>But the Briton’s contract with Mercedes expires at the end of the year, and now aged 35, it’s generally accepted that Hamilton is moving into the later stages of his F1 career.</p>
<p>But once he does eventually hang up the gloves, is anyone waiting in the wings to take over as Britain’s next racing hero?</p>
<p>Well, Fittipaldi believes Norris will be that man, tipping the McLaren driver to lock horns with Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc in a battle for F1 supremacy.</p>
<p>“Lando Norris has all the ingredients to be a champion. He’s World Championship title material for sure,” he told Standard Sport.</p>
<p>“He’s very talented, he’s been very successful in karting and other formula and it’s great to see another British challenger come along.”</p>

<p>Of course something that could complicate that for Norris is his machinery.</p>
<p>Verstappen has a long-term deal signed with Red Bull who are in the hunt for victories, whilst Leclerc has the same security with Ferrari for whom he won two races in 2019 during his first season with the team.</p>
<p>McLaren meanwhile did make improvements in 2019, but still they are some way off challenging for wins on merit.</p>
<p>The McLaren Group have also encountered financial difficulties in recent months.</p>
<p>But Fittipaldi is convinced that McLaren are back on the right path and that Norris will be the surprise title contender in the coming years.</p>
<p>“McLaren came back very strong last year,” he said.</p>
<p>“We know already that Verstappen and Leclerc are showing their potential but you have to say Lando Norris as well.</p>
<p>“There’s so many great talents, he’s right up there for me and part of a new golden era. Lando is maybe the unknown of the three but for me he’s as much World Champion material as the other two.”</p>
<p>But, Fittipaldi also made it clear that he doesn’t think Hamilton is anywhere close to being done.</p>
<p>“There’s still much more winning ahead of him, he’s going to create history,” he said.</p>
<p>“The numbers don’t lie.”</p>
