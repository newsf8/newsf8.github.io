They were all fired up. An enterprising city kindergarten teacher&hellip;</p>
<p>A doctor shows the lungs of COVID-19 patient at the MontLegia CHC hospital in Liege, Belgium, today.</p>
<p>A cat in Belgian has tested positive for the coronavirus after catching the potentially deadly bug from an infected owner, officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The sick pet in Liège tested positive after showing classic symptoms of COVID-19 — including difficulty breathing — a week after its owner first fell sick, health officials told a press conference, the Brussels Times reports.</p>
<p>While it is the first known infection of a cat, two dogs in Hong Kong have previously tested positive — with the first, a 17-year-old Pomeranian, dying after returning home from quarantine.</p>
<p>“The cat had diarrhea, kept vomiting and had breathing difficulties. The researchers found the virus in the cat’s feces,” professor Steven Van Gucht said Friday, according to the outlet.</p>
<p>No information was given on the conditions of either the cat or its owner, the Brussels Times said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization insists that there is “no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19” to humans.</p>
<p>Van Gucht also stressed that the Liège case appeared to be the owner getting her pet sick.</p>
<p>“We want to stress that this is an isolated case,” he said, according to the Belgian newspaper. “The risk of animal-to-human transmission is very small.”</p>
<p>Belgium’s National Council for Animal Protection (CNPA) also told the paper that there is no known threat from pets.</p>
<p>“Animals are not vectors of the epidemic, so there is no reason to abandon your animal,” the agency said — while advising owners to “not rub their nose against their pets.”</p>
<p>As well as the cat, 7,284 people have been confirmed infected with coronavirus in Belgium, with almost 300 deaths, officials also said at the press conference.

<h3 id="coronavirus-cat-owners-fear-pets-will-make-them-sick">Coronavirus: Cat owners fear pets will make them sick</h3>

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People are wanting their cats to be rehomed fearing they will catch the virus</p>
<p>Cat owners fear they will catch coronavirus from their pets with some asking for them to be rehomed, an animal charity has said.</p>
<p>Iris&rsquo;s Cats In Need in Stoke-on-Trent has received several calls from owners worrying their pets will make them sick.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said there is no evidence that pets can be infected by Covid-19.</p>
<p>Volunteer Claire Jones said: &ldquo;You cannot catch this from a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 42-year-old said the charity has had several calls about rehoming cats, &ldquo;Mostly, it&rsquo;s people who haven&rsquo;t got access to the right information online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are worried about somebody stroking the cat outside and passing it on to them. It doesn&rsquo;t work like that,&rdquo; she told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.</p>
<p>Iris&rsquo;s Cats In Need said self-isolation has led to a drop in the number of people able to help.</p>
<p>Food donations are also down as panic buying hits supermarkets, it said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re worried about running out of food. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve had any at our collection point at Tesco, in Kidsgrove, but we do know they&rsquo;ve had a short supply,&rdquo; Ms Jones said.</p>
<p>She said no cats have so far been left at the charity, but it has had &ldquo;a lot of requests&rdquo; for cats to be rehomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got 12 cats to add to our waiting list now&hellip; We do try to help people if they do have problems with their cats first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of nervous people out there, but we need to be clear your pets are not going to get you sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time to get a pet because you&rsquo;re going to be home a lot.&rdquo;</p>

Katy Shufon been home from her job as a catering manager because of the coronavirus outbreak, so she’s had more time to post videos of her cat, Meeko.</p>
<p>She sometimes dabbles in social media. On Thursday, however, she hit the Twitter jackpot.</p>
<p>In the last day, a clip she posted of Meeko doing something he always does — “wear” her slipper — has drawn more than one million views.</p>
<p>“Sometimes my cat walks around with my slipper like he’s wearing it,” she tweeted.</p>
<p>In the video, Meeko struts around wearing one (1) slipper on his front left paw. As the cat casually strolls through Shufon’s home, with each step, the slipper lands with a slap on the hardwood floor.</p>
<p>For a captive audience in which people seize upon any chance to laugh, Meeko has been quite the quarantine pick-me-up.</p>
<p>Sometimes my cat walks around with my slipper like he’s wearing it pic.twitter.com/8PZKssZyfq — KΔTY (@Dope_chakra) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>The first time she saw Meeko with his paw in the slipper, she thought he was just stuck. But this soon became a habit.</p>
<p>“He does it pretty often, whenever I leave my slippers out,&rdquo; Shufon, 23, tells NJ Advance Media. “If I call him out when he’s walking with the slipper, he’ll just drop it and walk away. He’s fun.”</p>
<p>And no, she has no clue why he does it.</p>
<p>But Shufon, who maintains an Instagram account for her cat at meeko_the_cool_cat, is glad to see that Meeko has helped to lift people’s spirits.</p>
<p>“I don’t use social media often, so I didn’t think my hundred or something followers would do anything with that,” she says.</p>
<p>“&lsquo;This is what I needed on this day,'&rdquo; was one refrain of the many comments that poured in on Twitter, she says. “It makes me so happy.”</p>
<p>The newfound internet fame has brightened Shufon’s days, which usually consist of staying inside while Meeko looks out the window, people-watching those who have chosen not to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>“If he’s in the room when I get a notification, I definitely let him know that he’s famous,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Shufon adopted Meeko, a 6-year-old American shorthair, from the Humane Society in upstate New York (she hails from the Albany area).</p>
<p>“He makes me laugh like that literally all the time,&rdquo; she says of her cat. “I’m giggling 10 times a day.”</p>
<p>If she goes in the bathroom, Meeko will often put his paws under the door until she lets him in.</p>
<p>“He likes to try to open doors and he’s weirdly good at it.”</p>
<p>He also loves tummy rubs, she says.</p>
<p>“He’s a character.”</p>
