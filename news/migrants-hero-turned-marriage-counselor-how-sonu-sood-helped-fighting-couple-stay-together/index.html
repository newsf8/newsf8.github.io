<p><img src="https://img.mensxp.com/media/content/2020/Jun/Tear-jerking-Deaths-In-Bollywood-Films-That-Left-Us-Sad-For-Weeks800_5ed8ce3942adb.jpeg" alt="img">
Bollywood films are popular across the world for their nail-biting action and musicals. However, some films are definitely known for so much more - from being critically acclaimed to being made on a unique subject. However, another thing Bollywood is great at delivering is bad news in the shape of shocking deaths of characters in films we so often get attached to.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 8 films with characters that were killed off in an intense and yet deeply saddening turn of events.</p>
<ol>
<li>Movie: Ghajini</li>

His back story reveals his erstwhile life and his meeting with Kalpana. The two fall for each other despite initial rifts, however, Sanjay does not reveal his true identity to Kalpana. In the end, when she&rsquo;s killed by the mafia ringleader Ghajini, she dies without knowing Sanjay&rsquo;s true identity. The scene was incredibly sad and one can easily remember the spine-chilling background score Kaise Mujhe as Sanjay remembers Kalpana at the end of the film.</p>

The film will make you cry as you watch him reunite his parents at the end and succumb to the disease in the heartbreaking climax.</p>

</ol>
<p>Character: Shashank Dheer</p>
<p>Actor: Abhishek Bachchan</p>
<p>¬© IMDB</p>

</ol>
<p>Character: Harsh Kapoor</p>

MUMBAI: TellyChakkar.com has been on the forefront in reporting updates about the latest controversy wherein Hindustani Bhau aka Vikas Phatak lodged a complaint against Ekta Kapoor for a scene in ALTBalaji‚Äôs XXX season 2. (Read here: Ekta Kapoor responds to rape threats; Hindustani Bhau cries foul )</p>
<p>The said scene is in the first episode of XXX season 2 titled Pyaar aur Plastic. There‚Äôs a scene between actors Ribbhu Mehra and Aaditi Kohli wherein both ditch their respective partners and indulge in sexual intercourse. The wife wants to fantasize her army officer husband in her boyfriend and thus she asks him to dress up in his uniform and later she can be seen ripping off his uniform.</p>
<p>Well, Ekta has deleted the scene from the episode but has denied to apologize as she has been receiving rape threats and she is of the view that she wont bow down to the cyber bullying.</p>
<p>Now, the latest update is that popular vetran actor Mukesh Khanna has put across his opinion about the controversy. Mukesh made a video on his official YouTube age named Bhishm International. In the video, Khanna called out to Ekta for disrespecting the army officials. He also stated that Ekta‚Äôs shows and web-series are spoiling the minds of youth.</p>
<p>Have a look at the video:</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Mukesh had also expressed his disappointment during Ekta Kapoor‚Äôs version of Mahabharat days in the year 2008, wherein he opposed the modernisation of Mahabharat and the fact that Kapoor had allowed a tattoo on Draupadi‚Äôs (Anita Hasnandani) shoulder.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/06/reliance-industries-small-reuters.jpg" alt="img">
The surge in RIL PP share price came after Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani announced that the firm has become net debt-free nine months ahead of its deadline</p>
<p>Reliance Industries‚Äô partly paid shares (RIL PP) today hit 10 per cent upper circuit at Rs 812.90 apiece on BSE after rallying 22 per cent in just five days after listing on BSE and NSE. The surge in share price came after Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani announced that the firm has become net debt-free nine months ahead of its deadline. RIL PP share price opened at Rs 758.50 and hit an intraday low of Rs 748. On the listing day, partly paid-up rights issue shares of Reliance Industries opened at a premium of Rs 689 per equity. Reliance Industries completed India‚Äôs biggest ever rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore earlier this month. ‚ÄúThe partly paid shares have an element of call options attached since the investor can decide whether they want to participate in the further installments of the paid-up amount when Reliance calls it over the next year in May and November 2021,‚Äù Mohit Mehra, business analyst at Zerodha told Financial Express Online. ‚ÄúIn case of up moves in RIL ordinary shares, this built-in call option quality of partly-paid instrument causes gains on RIL PP to be higher in percentage terms,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In the intraday deals so far Reliance Industries share price has jumped 8 per cent to hit a fresh high of Rs 1,788.60 apiece taking the market capitalisation above Rs 11 lakh crore. ‚ÄúReliance Industries shares seem to have caught the fancy of investors, with the stock almost doubling from its 23rd March low of 864. A rise in Telecom ARPU coupled with assets sales, have taken Reliance on a different trajectory all-together,‚Äù said Aamar Deo Singh, Head Advisory, Angel Broking. The sharp rally in share price comes on back of the 11 investments in Jio Platforms and mega rights issue, which helped the company to become net debt-free. So far, Reliance Industries has sold 24.7 per cent equity stake in Jio platforms and raised Rs 115,693 crore.</p>
<p>According to the payment structure proposed by Reliance Industries for the Rs 53,124 crore rights issue, those who subscribed had to only pay 25 per cent of the price right now and the remaining in two installments in May and November next year. Mohit Mehra further explains that the theoretical value of the partly paid shares should be higher of (1) 25% of the price of ordinary RIL shares and (2) Price of ordinary RIL shares (75% of Rs 1257). ‚ÄúThere could be some premium or discount on the account of interest rate, volatility, and liquidity in the partly-paid shares among other things,‚Äù Mehra explained.</p>
<p>As of 3.15 PM, RIL shares were trading 6.19 per cent higher at Rs 1,757.45 apiece on BSE, as compared to a 1.47 per cent rise in S&amp;P BSE Sensex. In the recent research reports, foreign brokerages such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and CLSA recommended to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô the stock.

<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/01af0dd4-b468-11ea-b8d7-dab47869eae4.jpg" alt="img">
Abhishek Bachchan, who has completed two decades in Bollywood, has been chronicling his journey on social media. In his new Instagram post, he revealed that he struggled to get his debut film, ‚Äòdespite trying very hard‚Äô. He said that he approached many producers and directors but nothing worked out.</p>
<p>In the post, Abhishek said that he was supposed to start his career with filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra in 1998. ‚ÄúMany don‚Äôt know that in 1998 @rakeyshommehra and I wanted to start our film careers together. Him directing me in a script we both worked on called ‚ÄúSamjhauta Express‚Äù. Both not able to get anyone to launch us despite trying very hard. I forget how many producers and directors I met and requested to give me an opportunity to act. But to no avail! We both were friends and decided that we would develop something that Rakeysh could direct and I would act in and that‚Äôs how Samjhauta Express was conceived,‚Äù he wrote.</p>
<p>Samjhauta Express got shelved but Abhishek‚Äôs look for the film helped him land the lead role in JP Dutta‚Äôs Refugee, which marked his big screen debut. ‚ÄúRakeysh went on to make Aks with my father and I was luckily spotted by JP saab. He liked my ‚Äòlook‚Äô, I had grown my hair long and a beard for SE. JP saab was thinking of making Akhri Mughal ( a historical ) and was on the lookout for a young fresh face‚Ä¶ I got lucky. He never made Akhri Mughal but made Refugee instead,‚Äù the actor said.</p>
<p>Abhishek and Rakeysh finally got a chance to work together in Delhi-6, which also starred Sonam Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman and Rishi Kapoor. ‚ÄúSuch a beautiful cast. We were all like one big family, always together even after wrap. Great senior actors that I could have only dreamt of acting with. Such a special experience,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>Abhishek also talked about his other release in 2009 ‚Äì R Balki‚Äôs Paa. He shared screen space with his father Amitabh Bachchan, who incidentally played his son in the film. ‚ÄúPaa, saw me reunite with my Pa! Our 6th film together. My first with Balki and second with @balanvidya also my first film as a Producer. It was such a unique concept and so sensitively handled. Only by the quirky mind of Balki! The film went on to great box-office success and won several awards for everyone,‚Äù he wrote.</p>
<p>Paa also won Abhishek his first National Award, as a producer. ‚ÄúWe also managed to win 3 National Film awards. @amitabhbachchan for best actor, Arundhati Ji for supporting actress and yours truly, as producer, for best film (Hindi) all of it entirely due to Balki. None of it would have been possible without his vision and conviction. I‚Äôm told dad and I even hold a Guinness book of world record for our film,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Amritsar, June 21</p>
<p>A month after lifting the restrictions on the manufacturing industry, most of businesses have not yet gained their full potential as seen before the lockdown.</p>
<p>Mukesh Nanda, a brick-kiln operator, says the duration of production at brick-kilns always remains short which begins in the middle of February and ends in July.</p>
<p>But owing to the lockdown, production is further reduced by almost 50 per cent. Poor sale means poor income which creates more problems as production at brick-kilns requires a huge labour cost and working capital. Moreover, returning of labourers to their home states has added to the problem of shortage of labour for the industry.</p>
<p>Raman Gupta, herbal medicine manufacturer, says the production has come down to one third of the previous sales figures. Reasons are poor demand, products losing competitiveness for the time being due to high cost of production, high fuel prices and international air freight of goods has got four times costlier than the earlier ones.</p>
<p>Gupta adds demand from the domestic as well as international markets is very low as Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown have reduced the consumption pattern across the world.</p>
<p>Ajay Mehra, proprietor of a warp knitting unit, says as main markets like Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai are not fully operational and customers are not buying for any festivities or weddings there is no demand for our fabric. Warp knitting units are almost closed.</p>
<p>Kamal Dalmia, a leading yarn manufacturer, says yarn units are working for four days a week and that too at 50 per cent capacity. Buyers of yarn are not paying previous dues. The availability of labour is hardly 50 per cent but it hardly pinches as there are not enough orders to meet. Bankers are offering loans as per the Union Government schemes but the moot question is after taking loans how would they repay it.
