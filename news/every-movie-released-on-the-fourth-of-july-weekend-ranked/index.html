<p>A bank clerk played by Ryan Reynolds discovers he’s a background character in a video game that will soon go offline, so he teams up with one of its programmers to try to save the day. That’s the plot of the metacomedy Free Guy, and in a parallel universe, we’d all be gearing up for its July 3 release. The movie would be splashed across thousands of screens in multiplexes around the country, and we’d plunk down an obscene amount of moolah to recline in a comfy seat, soak in some air conditioning, and gaze straight ahead for two hours. Not because critics praised it for being the movie we need right now or because it’s poised to be an early Oscar front-runner, but because Free Guy perfectly encapsulates the Fourth of July movie release. And who are we to buck with tradition?</p>
<p>There have always been two kinds of big-screen summer offerings: Ones that open during the coveted Independence Day window and &hellip; the other ones. And don’t start with me about the Memorial Day weekend cache. The first Friday in May has been the unofficial summer movie kickoff since Tobey Maguire put on his first pair of Spider-Man tights in 2002. (Black Widow owned that slot in 2020 until all the theaters shut down.) But by the Fourth of July, most Americans aside from Joey Chestnut are in vacation mode and the only things to do are go to the movies and rate the quality of the local neighborhood fireworks show. It’s not too much to expect—no, demand—jaw-dropping explosiveness out of our big-screen options. We want movies, not films. And for decades now, studios have satiated that desire, providing the boldest and brashest and most brainless (in a good way!) big-budget megablockbusters.</p>
<p>While this Fourth of July custom doesn’t date back to 1776, or even 1976, a look back at the entertainment calendar reveals a long, distinguished list of grade A glorious escapism. Think hyped-up sequels and ’80s classics and dumb comedies and exactly two adaptations of old-timey TV Westerns. We have the famed Will Smith collection and the less-heralded-but-still-mighty Tom Hanks collection. But there have also been plenty of would-be hits that have fizzled out or flat-out failed to launch. (Side note: July 4 provides the best metaphors!) There is a clear hierarchy when it comes to every movie that has been released on the Fourth of July weekend dating back to 1985. With that preamble out of the way, kindly note these rankings are based not on hoity-toity pedigree, but on how well the releases delivered on fun-out-of-the-sun summer bliss. Enjoy and wish Free Guy the best of luck in December!</p>
<ol start="56">
<li>Wild Wild West (1999)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a testament to Will Smith’s late-’90s star power that he assumed audiences would show up to a bloated and joyless retro sci-fi comedy Western based on a dusty 1960s TV show. They didn’t. Turns out that playing a sexy government agent on a mission to destroy a genocidal recidivist from the Confederate South isn’t as cool as, say, slipping on a pair of Ray-Bans. Last year, Smith admitted that he turned down Neo in The Matrix to take the role of Jim Wet because he valued above-the-title fame more than artistic vision. Whoops.</p>
<ol start="55">
<li>The BFG (2016)</li>
</ol>
<p>What a sad day in movieland when Steven Spielberg—the legend who invented the summer blockbuster by way of Jaws in 1975—is responsible for an uninspiring dud. His interpretation of the Roald Dahl fantasy novel means well, but who goes into a Spielberg production for good intentions? Or, for that matter, to see mild-mannered British thespian Mark Rylance appear larger than life as the Big Friendly Giant?</p>
<ol start="54">
<li>Lone Ranger (2013)</li>
</ol>
<p>Johnny Depp had a solid 20-year run playing the appealing oddball. That goodwill comes to a screeching halt as he dons tribal paint and puts a taxidermied crow on top of his head to play the trusted Tonto in the positively dreadful Disney adaptation of a serial that dates back to 1933. (Armie Hammer is the heroic masked man.) Toss in all of Depp’s strange eccentricities in the role, and it’s easy to see why his depiction came under fire for reinforcing Native American stereotypes instead of overcoming them.</p>
<ol start="53">
<li>The Last Airbender (2010)</li>
</ol>
<p>Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan breaks from crafting spooky original stories with mostly contrived third-act twists to take on a long-winded and incoherent fantasy epic based on a popular animated series. Something something something about an imaginary era in which the world is divided into four nations and the Fire Nation wars with the others for domination; currently sitting at 5 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
<ol start="52">
<li>Judge Dredd (1995)</li>
</ol>
<p>John Travolta wasn’t the only beloved ’70s-bred star who staged a seriously impressive comeback in the mid-’90s. Witness the case of Sylvester Stallone, whose career was in peril thanks to the troubled trifecta of Rocky V, Oscar, and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. But he got it right with Cliffhanger in 1993—an action-packed Die Hard–on-a-mountain thriller. Stallone shot back up to the A-list that summer, along with the T. Rex from Jurassic Park. However, this grim sci-pic two years later, which launched a dozen headlines with the word “dread” in the title, is a step back. As a law enforcer of an urban wasteland, he wears a suit so big and bulky that Rocky Balboa could have hung it in a meat locker and used it as a speed bag.</p>
<ol start="51">
<li>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000)</li>
</ol>
<p>At the turn of the century, nostalgia still ran sufficiently deep for the cartoon characters Rocket T. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose—as well as their Eastern Bloc rivals, spies Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo) and the Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro). This scattered hybrid of animation and live action aimed to be the next Who Framed Roger Rabbit? but instead came dangerously close to Howard the Duck.</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>License to Wed (2007)</li>
</ol>
<p>With this tepid comedy, we realized once and for all that Robin Williams could not, in fact, spin the most insipid and formulaic script into gold. He’s the in-demand reverend who won’t bless the union of an engaged couple (John Krasinski and Mandy Moore!) until they pass his silly marriage prep course. We’re lucky Krasinski and Moore didn’t get their super-appealing celeb licenses revoked.</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>Larry Crowne (2011)</li>
</ol>
<p>How peculiar that America’s Dad and America’s Sweetheart—i.e., Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, duh—have teamed up for two movies, yet both projects failed to capitalize on their supersized charms. Big mistake. Big. Huge! Charlie Wilson’s War was so-so project No. 1; this sitcom-y romantic comedy is No. 2. When it comes to sparkling chemistry with his leading lady, Hanks (playing a downsized exec turned college student) is no Richard Gere.</p>
<ol start="48">
<li>I Love Trouble (1994)</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe we shouldn’t be too hard on Larry Crowne. After all, we still got to see Hanks and Roberts play it breezy and easy. It could have been worse. She could have, say, languished in a misfire screwball comedy and attempted to sell a romance with a crabby Nick Nolte. (Cowritten by Nancy Meyers!)</p>

<ol start="47">
<li>Baby’s Day Out (1994)</li>
</ol>
<p>I just studied the IMDB entry for this movie and refuse to believe its contents. Apparently, this lame-brained comedy about a wealthy baby’s abduction and subsequent escape in Chicago is one of John Hughes’s final original screenwriting credits. I weep for the future.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li>The Shadow (1994)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can’t blame Alec Baldwin if he’s trying to forget the summer of 1994. Not only did he sport a silly fedora, cops-and-robbers-style bandanna, and black cape to be the Shadow—a character so dated that Citizen Kane director Orson Welles once played him on the radio—and proceed to watch it flop at the box office, but he also must have seethed as the Harrison Ford–starring Clear &amp; Present Danger became the highest-grossing Tom Clancy adaptation ever. Baldwin, of course, was the original Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October but claimed in his memoir that he was pushed out to make room for Ford.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>Blown Away (1994)</li>
</ol>
<p>Tommy Lee Jones is a former member of the Irish Republican Army who escapes from jail and tries to pick off members of Boston’s police bomb squad and &hellip; you know, maybe we should all just go ahead and write off the summer of 1994.</p>
<ol start="44">
<li>Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)</li>
</ol>
<p>Not bad if you have a thing for lousy scripts, bombastic 3D effects, migraine-inducing edits, and lots of stuff being blown up. Oh, and 157 minutes to spare for finding out what would happen if robots were discovered by Apollo astronauts on the 1969 moon landing.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>The Way, Way Back (2013)</li>
</ol>
<p>This should have been one of those movies that world-premiered up at the mountains at the Sundance Film Festival to a swarm of positive buzz, leading to cred as a summer sleeper hit and maybe a few Indie Spirit Awards. Just one problem: Even though this shaggy coming-of-age comedy reunites Little Miss Sunshine’s Steve Carell and Toni Collette, costars Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph, Allison Janney, and Amanda Peete, is scripted by Oscar-winners and actors Jim Rash and Nat Faxon (The Descendants), mostly takes place at a good-times water park over the summer, and features a sing-along to Mr. Mister’s “Kyrie,” it’s just so-so. The lesson? You can’t manufacture likeability.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Son in Law (1993)</li>
</ol>
<p>It was Beverly Hills scholar Cher Horowitz who once reminded us that searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie. In other words, July 4 weekend was the ideal time to unveil this dippy but sorta watchable comedy about an innocent country girl (Carla Gugino) who goes away to school, befriends Shore’s party-hearty dude character and then brings him back to the South Dakota farm—where he pretends to be her fiancé. Please note his name is Crawl.</p>
<ol start="41">
<li>About Last Night &hellip; (1986)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one of the more underrated Brat Pack offerings, and not just because of the Elizabeth Perkins–as-best-friend factor or because the source material is a 1974 David Mamet play. One year after Rob Lowe regaled Demi Moore about the legend of St. Elmo’s Fire in her barren hot-pink bedroom, the stars take the drama down a few notches as yuppie Chicago 20-somethings. A hot one-night stand leads to an up-and-down committed relationship. Sure-fire sign that things are getting serious: a montage of love and affection set to a Bob Seger torch song.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>The Karate Kid Part III (1989)</li>
</ol>
<p>No Johnny Lawrence? Fine, then no respectable ranking.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Hancock (2008)</li>
</ol>
<p>On the thematic upside, the superhero at the center of this quirky satire shares a name with the man who signed his name nice and big on the Declaration of Independence. But given the talent involved, it’s still an underwhelming effort. Oh, you think I’m referring to a cast that includes Will Smith, Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman, and Friday Night Lights’ Brad “Buddy Garrity” Leland as Executive No. 3? Not really, for this script is cowritten by brilliant Breaking Bad auteur Vince Gilligan.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Superman Returns (2006)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once upon a time, the fate of the most storied superhero of all time lay in the hands of Bryan Singer. He delivered a heavily nostalgic albeit cumbersome iteration that hasn’t aged particularly well over the past 14 years—especially compared to the sprightly MCU movies that followed. That’s Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel, Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, all of whom were a one-and-done in the franchise. Singer does closely follow the saga that director Richard Donner laid out in 1978’s wonderful Superman and its 1980 sequel—he even keeps the whooshing, John Williams–scored opening credits. He also seemingly spins the world backward to erase the awful Superman III and IV: The Quest for Peace from the narrative. And yet!</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Scary Movie 2 (2001)</li>
</ol>
<p>Scary Movie was such a monster hit in the summer of 2000 that the Wayans brothers had to whip up a sequel at warp speed. (Interestingly, the same fate befell Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven after Scream did big box office returns in 1996.) The result is a hit-and-miss, palpably rushed follow-up.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde (2003)</li>
</ol>
<p>What, like it’s hard to devise a worthy sequel to the sunniest (and pinkest) comedy ever? Yes, in fact! Reese Witherspoon’s Elle Woods and her little dog Bruiser go to Washington D.C. to work for a senator and triumph in the Beltway. Alas, all those blonde jokes aren’t as fun this time around.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995)</li>
</ol>
<p>Ivan Ooze wreaks vengeance on Zordon for imprisoning him. It’s up to the Rangers to head to a distant planet called Phaedos to hunt down the mystic warrior Dulcea and obtain the Great Power. Hard to believe, but for fans of the popular kids series, that plotline made perfect sense. The adaptation was a mild hit and is kind of considered a cult classic. The cast? All you really need to know is that Pink Ranger Amy Jo Johnson went on to play Julie in Felicity.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Despicable Me 2 (2013)</li>
</ol>
<p>My nephew loves this franchise and thinks that the minions are hilarious, so there’s that.</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)</li>
</ol>
<p>This entry is part of a group of Fourth of July Spider-Mans, but it doesn’t match the others in terms of story (how many more times can we watch poor Uncle Ben get shot in his car?), casting (Andrew Garfield never looks comfortable in the title role), special effects (the spider webs never pop off the screen) or, just, you know, overall quality. Even costar Sally Field admitted the movie is blah and that she only took the role of Aunt May as a favor to her ailing friend, producer Laura Ziskin.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Public Enemies (2009)</li>
</ol>
<p>This should have been great. As in, GREAT. To recap: It’s a sprawling historical crime drama in which a top FBI agent (played by Christian Bale) doggedly pursues notorious bank robber John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp). Marion Cotillard, fresh off her Oscar win, Billy Crudup, and Channing Tatum fill out supporting roles. Legendary director Michael Mann is behind the camera. But the ambitious cat-and-mouse saga never reaches full boil like, well, Mann’s epic Heat 14 years earlier.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)</li>
</ol>
<p>No James Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong, no Robert Patrick, and needless to say, no Michael Biehn. But we do get Arnold Schwarzenegger—once again playing for the good guys—attempting to save adult John Connor (Nick Stahl) from a new Terminator (Kristanna Loken) sent from the future. Director Jonathan Mostow (U-571) actually doesn’t embarrass himself with this lean-and-mean follow-up to one of the greatest sequels of all time. Which we’ll get to much, much later &hellip;</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Men in Black 2 (2002)</li>
</ol>
<p>Summer sequel math: Will Smith + Tommy Lee Jones – Vincent D’Onofrio – Linda Fiorentino + Michael Jackson = Fail.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Phenomenon (1996)</li>
</ol>
<p>John Travolta is riding a white-hot streak of Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty. So powerful is he, taking on the role of a mere mortal seems beneath him. Enter this mawkish New Age–y fable, in which he plays a mechanic who sees a flash of light and suddenly becomes deity-like. With newfound abilities, he can move objects with his brain! Travolta also plays a non-Earthling in his next movie, Michael, and four years later in Battlefield Earth. Moving on &hellip;</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>The Patriot (2000)</li>
</ol>
<p>Look, a seemingly ideal Fourth of July entry! Except, um, that’s Mel Gibson leading the charge of the American Revolution in a violent 158-minute epic made by the Independence Day guys and let’s just say that staging 1917-esque historical battle scenes isn’t their forte. Heath Ledger shines as the oldest of Gibson’s seven children; his death is both devastating and hilariously operatic.</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>The Great Mouse Detective (1986)</li>
</ol>
<p>As if I’d leave out Disney’s most endearing use of big-screen vermin—that is, until Ratatouille eclipsed it 20 years later. This spoof of Sherlock Holmes features the voice work of Vincent Price, an original score from Henry Mancini, and is directed by the guys who went on to helm The Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; the Beast, and Aladdin.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Summer of Sam (1999)</li>
</ol>
<p>A decade after the groundbreaking social and visual drama Do the Right Thing, director Spike Lee presses the rewind button to focus on the restless New York City summer of 1977. The scorching intensity remains, albeit with less emotional resonance. Interestingly, Lee shares a writing credit with Michael Imperioli. There must be a great story behind that.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Like Mike (2002)</li>
</ol>
<p>The only movie on this list whose title was inspired by the tagline of a Gatorade commercial, this comedy boasts the lineup of an NBA All-Star Game but lacks its ultra-entertaining offensive display. The movie, of course, centers on teen Calvin (rapper Lil Bow Wow), who finds a pair of sneakers with the faded “MJ” initials written inside. After putting them on, he becomes a basketball hot shot, playing against the likes of David Robinson, Dirk Nowitzki, Allen Iverson, Alonzo Mourning, Steve Nash, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Gary Payton, Rasheed Wallace, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson, and Chris Webber. Michael Jordan himself, however, does not appear. (Also confusing: Every real-life NBA team exists in the Like Mike universe except the Los Angeles Lakers; Calvin plays for the L.A. Knights instead. Kobe Bryant also doesn’t exist in this universe—Calvin’s nemesis turned mentor turned adopted father is a Kobe type played by Morris Chestnut.)</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Innerspace (1987)</li>
</ol>
<p>Hurray for the 1980s and its goofy high-concept sci-fi comedies. Did you think E.T. was too heart-wrenching? Then try Short Circuit, in which a lovable robot named Number 5 escapes from a research facility and learns to interact with Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy while yelling out “Number 5 is alive!!!!” and dancing to an El DeBarge song. But I digress. Here we have Dennis Quaid as a Navy test pilot who undergoes a top-secret miniaturization experiment and accidentally gets injected into the body of a hypochondriac clerk (Martin Short). Quaid’s then-love interest Meg Ryan is the love interest. Absurd fun with Amblin technology to boot.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>Adventures in Babysitting (1987)</li>
</ol>
<p>I see your summertime blues and raise it with the babysitting blues. May I also offer: Bradley Whitford driving his own car, complete with an Illinois So Cool vanity plate befitting his jerk character; Vincent D’Onofrio with flowing blonde, Noah Syndergaard–like locks, which prompt a little girl to refer to him as Thor; and Elizabeth Shue stopping a gang fight on a Chicago subway by declaring, “Don’t f#$#% with the babysitter!”</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>War of the Worlds (2005)</li>
</ol>
<p>Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg follow up the masterful Minority Report with a modern rendition of the H.G. Wells aliens-take-over-the-Earth classic. It’s a gripping ride, with no shortage of well-choreographed CGI’ed set pieces. That said, how many of these set pieces do you even remember 15 years later?</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Big Trouble in Little China (1986)</li>
</ol>
<p>Having crafted some of the most iconic horror films of all time, director John Carpenter decided to chuck logic and make a campy mystical action-adventure-comedy-kung-fu-monster ghost story. Behold Kurt Russell, channeling Indiana Jones on hallucinogens, getting tangled up in the supernatural dealings of an ancient Chinese cult in San Francisco. (It’s a long story.) A box-office flop in the 1980s, it actually enjoyed a second life thanks to the wonderful world of video rentals.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Boomerang (1992)</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe we should start with the soundtrack: It’s a ’90s slow-jam classic, a mix of mammoth hits (Boys II Men’s “End of The Road,” P.M. Dawn’s “I’d Die Without You”) and contributions from a very young Toni Braxton, TLC, A Tribe Called Quest, Johnny Gill, and Grace Jones. On the screen, we have Eddie Murphy as an obnoxious womanizer who meets his match with his glamazon new corporate boss (Robin Givens)—and ends up falling for a down-to-Earth artist (Halle Berry). Hurray for these two smart and independent women, both of whom go toe-to-toe with Murphy. (Not just saying that because his character has a hang-up about ugly feet.)</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>The Perfect Storm (2000)</li>
</ol>
<p>Quick: Name the star of this movie. If you guessed George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, Diane Lane, William Fichtner, Michael Ironside, or John Hawkes—or even Karen Allen (she’s on the sailboat)—then you’re mistaken. The answer is that mammoth CGI-enhanced wall-of-water tidal wave that renders this fact-based action pic into Twister on the high seas. The poor men aboard the doomed Andrea Gail in 1991 never stood a chance.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Magic Mike XXL (2015)</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the sight of Joe Manganiello gyrating against a convenience store fridge to the dulcet sounds of “I Want It That Way” is what summertime euphoria is all about.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)</li>
</ol>
<p>If Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were the mighty tent poles of the MCU universe over the past few years, this amiable sequel was the hammock between them. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly keep it light and leisurely, as there’s never any doubt that they won’t team up and take care of whatever mishigas is going on inside that Quantum Realm.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</li>
</ol>
<p>Originally scheduled as lightweight counterprogramming opposite Superman Returns, the smash quick-witted comedy is still considered a zeitgeist behemoth with unabashed loyalists that include John Legend and the 2016 Green Bay Packers. Its fabulousness knows no written boundaries, but in this context, let’s salute the incomparable Meryl Streep for portraying soft-spoken editor Miranda Priestley as both an icy ultrademanding villain and a cool-headed superhero with the fortitude to steer a wildly influential fashion magazine. (Moment of silence for the period when fashion-magazine employment was still a jealousy-inducing big deal.) Prada is also endlessly quotable, taught us the difference between cerulean and lapis, and turned Emily Blunt into a star. That’s all.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>The Firm (1993)</li>
</ol>
<p>Eh, sure, I could rave about the twisty mystery-suspense plot. Or the classy tip-top cast, which includes Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, Paul Sorvino, Jeanne Tripplehorn, David Strathairn, and Margo Martindale as Tom Cruise’s secretary at the shady mob-connected firm of Bendini, Lambert and Locke. Or single out Gary Busey as a sleazy P.I. who dies a hero in his office after refusing to divulge why he’s asking questions about dead lawyers. But those attributes are big whatevers in comparison to the most unlikely scene in the history of cinema: A frenzied Cruise kicking and beating the crap out of a helpless Wilford Brimley while yelping out, “You! Sick! Son! Of! A! Bitch!!!!”</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Transformers (2007)</li>
</ol>
<p>We now travel back to the days of yore, when the very first live-action Autobots vs. Decepticons showdown towered as a quintessential big, loud, dumb-fun blockbuster. That’s because director Michael Bay somehow taps into the toy-playing child in all of us—and delivers bonanza special effects in nearly every frame. This movie is going to make a fascinating chapter in star Shia LaBeouf’s future memoir, fingers crossed.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990)</li>
</ol>
<p>“How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?” Stop asking rhetorical questions, John McClane, and just figure out how to access the secret underground tunnel that will lead you smack dab in the middle of the Washington-Dulles airport runway so you can stop sinister Colonel Stuart from diverting planes into the Potomac and make sure he doesn’t escape with the criminal drug warlord in tow!!!! A movie with less authenticity than Transformers, the thrill here is watching our hero triumph as neither snow nor sleet nor hand grenades nor airport power failures nor machine guns nor martial-arts fighting on the wing of an in-motion, fully fueled 747 can keep him down—or stop him from cracking wise.</p>

<li>A League of Their Own (1992)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now is as good a time as ever to remember what Tom Hanks once told us about America’s Pastime. Not the crying thing, but that the hard is what makes baseball great. Under director Penny Marshall’s guidance (she is the only female director on this list), this story of the scrappy players in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League circa World War II is like a cloudless sky at the ballpark with the fragrance of Cracker Jacks, grilled hot dogs, and beer wafting through the air and the nostalgic aura to match. Your MVP? While Hanks, Geena Davis, Lori Petty, and Rosie O’Donnell are all easy to root for, the vote goes to Madonna as gum-chomping Rockford Peach spitfire “All the Way” Mae. You’ve got to respect a woman who can vogue and slide into third.</p>

<p>Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spider-Man 2 (2004)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spider-Man Homecoming (2017)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The awkward teen with the ability to shoot webs out of his hands has done what the Shadow and Judge Dredd could only dream of: become the most reliable superhero of the summer. Start with Spider-Man 2, a surprisingly poignant young-adult drama starring Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst that many experts maintain is one of the best entries in the genre, period. And while The Amazing Spider-Man was a step back, this franchise is nothing if not amazingly resilient: Homecoming and its sequel Far From Home are both fast and funny, thanks in large part to star Tom Holland’s charismatic, wide-eyed portrayal of Peter Parker and his alter ego. Hopefully the cameras start rolling on the third chapter before the British actor grows out of the role and is forced to bequeath it to some TikTok star.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Apollo 13 (1995)</li>
</ol>
<p>It was marketed as a rah-rah true story chronicling the story of the NASA astronauts who nearly died trying to get to the moon in 1970. So even without the benefit of Wikipedia, we knew full well Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) would defy the odds—not to mention the Problem—and splash down safely in Florida and live to tell their harrowing tale. And yet, director Ron Howard provides heart-pounding and exhilarating suspense inside that vomit comet. The chest-thumping displays of good old-fashioned tenacity and teamwork helped, too.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Armageddon (1998)</li>
</ol>
<p>Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, directed by Michael Bay, scripted by six credited screenwriters, and starring Bruce Willis at his most Bruce Willis-y, this blockbuster was seemingly formulated in a lab to be the biggest moneymaker of the year &hellip; and the experiment worked! Whereas the similarly plotted Deep Impact, released in May 1998, relied on cerebral conversations about the haves vs. have-nots as an asteroid hurtled toward Earth, its July rival said “to hell with informed thoughts” and awed us with its blunt-force booms and effectively dopey dialogue (“I’m just tryin’ to have fun before I die!”) with an Aerosmith power ballad chaser. Brilliant.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Men in Black (1997)</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps it took last year’s DOA disaster Men in Black: International for fans to truly appreciate the joys of the original. Actually, nah, we’ve known it all along. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones play it perfectly as the galaxy defenders who experience close encounters of the alien kind in a terrifically entertaining effort that manages to be funny, hip, and, at just 98 minutes, super zippy. A perfect theme song and video as well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Coming to America (1988)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s 1987; Eddie Murphy isn’t just the king of comedy, he has the clout to go to the head of Paramount and sell a fairy tale about an African prince who, after years of being adored by worshipful women, heads to Queens, New York, to get a real life and find a real wife. The pitch results in a mega-crowd-pleaser. Fans are treated to hilarious hijinks, a surprisingly sweet story, and some Trading Places closure. (Hurray for no spoilers in a social-media-free world!) It’s the most durable comedy of the Murphy milieu, and, if we’re being honest, it’s a mixed blessing that he decided to add to an already-perfect confection with a December sequel. Doesn’t he realize that satisfying follow-ups are nearly impossible to pull off? To wit &hellip;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re compiling a list of movies in which the sequel surpasses the already-pristine original, you have to start with The Godfather Part II. Then cite Aliens, Terminator 2, and, uh, that’s about it. James Cameron’s spectacular follow-up about a cyborg assassin sent back in time to take out the future resistance leader excels on all levels—from death-defying stunts to nifty chase scenes to state-of-the-art special effects to the tension that leaves knuckles whitened and nails bitten down to the nub. The money is on the screen every time the truly menacing Robert Patrick (and his cold, dead blue eyes) dissolves into liquid metal to assume the shape of anything he touches. Badass Linda Hamilton and her biceps are the real deal.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Back to the Future (1985)</li>
</ol>
<p>There was a fascinating Twitter debate a few months ago about the most perfect movie in history. When a few fans pushed back on a narrative flaw in this time-traveling classic—how could the new and improved 1985 versions of Lorraine and George McFly not recognize that their youngest son strongly resembles the cool, skateboarding teen at Hill Valley High School who played matchmaker for them 30 years earlier?—co-screenwriter Bob Gale filled in the blanks. Keep in mind, he explained, that Marty was in town for only a week back in October 1955 and without the help of photographs, their memories faded over time. That settled it: Back to the Future really is the most perfect movie in history, and fans should be grateful every day that Family Ties creator Gary David Goldberg allowed his star Michael J. Fox to pull double duty and get in that DeLorean.</p>
<p>But is it the most perfect Fourth of July movie? Not quite. Now, make like a tree &hellip; and keep reading.</p>
<ol>
<li>Independence Day (1996)</li>
</ol>
<p>Boom. And frankly, the only way to commemorate this ultimate so-bad-it’s-rad sci-fi thriller is to paraphrase Bill Pullman’s rousing Presidential speech. You know the one. Here goes.</p>
<p>[Clears throat.] In the past 24 years, Independence Day has held up as the largest, most bombastic movie in the history of patriotic cinema. Cinema. That word has new meaning today. We can’t be consumed by our petty logic issues anymore, like how Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch beat gridlock traffic in Washington D.C. to get to the White House before the countdown clock went to zero, or how Will Smith knew how to command an alien spaceship. So perhaps it’s fate that on the Fourth of July, we will once again turn to this splendid cheese-whiz entertainment. Not for its brilliant plotting or its nuanced character development, or to catch a glimpse of the actress who played Kelly Kapowski’s roommate on Saved by the Bell: The College Years &hellip; but for our right to see a movie in which we don’t have to use any brain cells. For the Fourth of July should no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when director Roland Emmerich gave us a reason to unite. We will not go quietly into that good night and stream The BFG and The Karate Kid Part III! We’re going to go big and watch Randy Quaid help defeat slimy aliens! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-tCLVgLq9X1GK-S_kMV79hnypM=/0x63:3200x1738/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20059938/BestMovies.jpg" alt="img">
There’s a great sight gag in Robert Altman’s Hollywood satire The Player, a building on a studio lot emblazoned with a phony but wholly accurate showbiz motto: “Movies … now more than ever.” In the context of a movie made in the early ’90s, this epigram criticized both the nascent direct-to-VHS market and the escalating spectacle of the most expensive blockbusters, literal and spiritual sequels to the special-effects-driven shlock that demolished Altman’s New Hollywood glory days. But the words also perfectly parody the kind of glib, pandering mantras people use to reassure themselves in times of crisis about the enduring importance of their practices and pastimes—in our current case, that the steady stream of VOD offerings we’re watching while waiting out a global pandemic constitute some form of film culture, and that, by extension, the movies still matter now … more than ever.</p>
<p>Maybe they do and maybe they don’t. Or maybe they never will again, at least not in the same way as when moviegoing was a fundamentally collective phenomenon, although we’ve arguably been heading in that direction for a while anyway. The question of whether cobbling together lists of the “best movies of the year” was ever more than an arbitrary inventory juxtaposing A-list titles from big studios with smallers films whose theatrical release dates come months or years after festival premieres is actually not all that different in 2020 than it was in 2019 or 2018. It seems increasingly common that smaller distributors will cut their losses by putting potential niche hits on demand rather than further biding their time for arthouses to re-open (Exhibit A: A24 putting First Cow online this month rather than rereleasing into theaters at a later date). The feeling of a “lost year” has begun to subside … at least for those positioned, savvy, or privileged enough to access (and subsidize) the network of “virtual cinemas” operating in the shadow of Netflix, iTunes, and Disney+.</p>
<p>For those with the desire and the time, the year to date has yielded a strong, diverse slate of movies, and most of what’s on this list can be found fairly easily at this point. Consider our top 25 an opportunity to play catch-up before we find out whether Christopher Nolan’s Tenet will even be released in time to round out 2020’s roll call. —Adam Nayman</p>

<p>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</p>
<p>Directed by Eliza Hittman (Focus)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>An experiential, almost methodological look at a young woman’s quest to get an abortion, Hittman’s third feature film never takes it eyes off Autumn (newcomer Sidney Flanigan), a protagonist with a deep reserve of unspoken pain, anxiety, and confusion. This is a movie increasingly rare in mainstream independent cinema—issue-driven but not preachy, empathetic but deeply unsentimental, riveting and disinterested in eventizing its circumstances. Hittman is already known for a patient gaze and what can sometimes seem like ambivalence about plotting. A bus ride from Pennsylvania to New York City plays like the slowest burn second act imaginable. But Never Rarely Sometimes Always takes that impressionistic style and subsumes it in a journey toward freedom, or at least finality, and all the complexities of coping with the end. This film, maybe the best movie released in 2020, feels like a turning point for a major American filmmaker. —Sean Fennessey</p>

<p>The Assistant</p>
<p>Dir. by Kitty Green (Bleecker Street)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>The stringent, rhythmic minimalism of Kitty Green’s workplace horror movie is the year’s most adroit and agile exercise in film direction; while not a lot happens in The Assistant, the film’s vision of silent, head-down professionalism as a form of complicity (consider the chilling implications of the title) is indelible, turning what might have otherwise been pegged as a #MeToo fable into something more effectively existential. As the immaculately dressed and styled drone trying to decide whether to tell on her sexually predatory boss, Julia Garner locates the intersection of self-effacement and self-negation; as the company’s concern-trolling HR gatekeeper, Matthew Macfadyen distills his sickly funny brilliance on Succession into a single, insidious sequence. —Nayman</p>
<p>Birds of Prey</p>
<p>Dir. by Cathy Yan (Warner Bros.)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>Or: The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Margot Robbie, freed from the leering, shaky gaze of Suicide Squad (you can keep the #AyerCut) and relocated before the focused directorial crosshairs of Cathy Yan, the Chinese-American director whose foray into the DCEU represents one of the brand’s only productive personnel decisions to date. Yan’s robust, precisely visualized fight scenes and capable comic-book storytelling—think Deadpool’s fourth wall breaking minus most of the Cards Against Humanity–style obnoxiousness—give Robbie a framework to deliver an affectionate, even lovable movie-star performance. Where in Suicide Squad she was clearly straining to break out from the grim grotesquerie, here she’s relaxed, funny, and surrounded by a group of equally game actresses (Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, and a hilariously stone-faced Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and given a worthily wormy male adversary in Ewan McGregor’s narcissistic beta-male crime lord, Black Mask. With what can only be called a sense of the moment, McGregor plays his character as the kind of guy you’d like to see get punched in the face, over and over. Luckily, Yan and Robbie oblige. —Nayman</p>
<p>The King of Staten Island</p>
<p>Dir. by Judd Apatow (Universal)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>For years, Apatow has been citing the work of John Cassavetes and Hal Ashby in his work. This was the first time I felt it. Maybe it was the outerboro blue collar milieu, dotted with firefighters and nurses and their aspirational seeds. Maybe it was cinematographer Robert Elswit’s dependence on natural lighting. Maybe it was Pete Davidson, Apatow’s latest Russian doll of comic tragedy who just happens to have more in common with a New Hollywood anti-hero than, say, Paul Rudd. Either way, this worked on me, a quarantine dramedy heavy on character actors doing their best bids in a long while (Steve Buscemi, Marisa Tomei) and a classic “Whoa, this funnyman is one helluva an actor” turn from Bill Burr. Apatow’s shadow is longer than his filmography, but it’s exciting to see him inch away from gags and lean into influence. For his next act, might I suggest a remake of Husbands starring Dave Chappelle, Marc Maron, Rob Delaney, and Jason Segel? OK, maybe that’s a bad idea. —Fennessey</p>
<p>Da 5 Bloods</p>
<p>Dir. by Spike Lee</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Netflix</p>
<p>At a certain point, Spike Lee’s riff on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre narrows from a banter-driven ensemble piece about a group of reunited servicemen into a showcase for Delroy Lindo—not that there’s anything wrong with that. There may be five Bloods, but the one who really counts is the anguished mountain of pent-up guilt and resentment in the battered MAGA cap. Tasked with embodying the contradictions of an embittered, politically dissident African American veteran for whom reparations, vengeance, and redemption have become inseparable, Lindo commits to an expansive, more-is-more performance whose biggest and most jaw-dropping moments—a veritable cocktail of blood, sweat, and tears—belie a master actor’s gift for control. Da 5 Bloods is an uneven movie—perhaps inevitably, given its intended scope and blistering intensity—but Lindo is extraordinary. —Nayman</p>
<p>Bacurau</p>
<p>Dir. by Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles (Kino Lorber)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>An absolutely wild treat from Brazil, colliding grindhouse storytelling and anti-colonialist allegory into a stew of hyperviolent, unpredictable entertainment. Kleber Mendonça Filho’s last film, 2016’s far more elegiac Aquarius, drew on his country’s incursion of political quagmires for a story about encroaching gentrification and one woman’s act of opposition. But Bacurau amplifies the ideas into something more mythological, integrating UFO imagery, Rambo-esque hunt sequences, and tribal warfare. Once again he casts Sônia Braga as his matriarch de résistance, and she leads the titular besieged settlement with ferocious and deadly resolve. This movie is truly one of a kind; seek it out if you’re feeling defiant. —Fennessey</p>
<p>First Cow</p>
<p>Dir. by Kelly Reichardt (A24)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD on July 10</p>
<p>An early distribution casualty of COVID-19, Kelly Reichardt’s beautifully written and acted period piece will hopefully get resurrected theatrically by A24 when the time is right. Even if seeing major movies on streaming platforms is now the new normal, any film this meticulously shot and sound-designed deserves the chance to work its magic in the dark. Essentially a parable of capitalist ingenuity and ambition set against the formation of American society—specifically a muddy, ethnically mixed outpost just off the Oregon Trail in the early 19th century—First Cow finds Reichardt revising the Western genre more subtly and powerfully than in Meek’s Cutoff; it’s like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid without outlaws or pistols, and an even more pronounced sense of tragedy for its doomed best-buddy heroes. Few American filmmakers this millennium can match Reichardt’s unbroken winning streak, and as usual, her casting choices are on point: In a perfect world, Orion Lee’s charismatic work as a Chinese immigrant turned small-scale pastry entrepreneur would be a star-maker. —Nayman</p>
<p>Bad Education</p>
<p>Dir. by Cory Finley</p>
<p>Where to Watch: HBO</p>
<p>A nifty little true-story morality play with provenance in my neck of the woods, the fiercely competitive domain of Long Island public schooling. Hugh Jackman stars as an eerily genuine high school administrator with the right glad-handing compliment for every school board booster and the right note of confidence for every student who stumbles into his office doubting their future. Things are not what they seem and unravel, obviously: He’s a bad … educator. Director Cory Finley, a playwright by trade, has a knack for uneasy confrontations and claustrophobic Kubrickian staging. (Lotta low angles and ominous dolly shots here!) His last movie, the underrated Thoroughbreds, peered through the lens of a couple of bored and devious teen girls. This time around, it’s the adults who are up to no damn good. It’s pat to yearn for this kind of arch talk-a-thon, but I love them. Thirty years ago, taut dramas like this competed for awards and were the subject of dinner party conversation fodder for my parents; now they’re just one more cotton ball in the medicinal jar of streaming video queues. But if there’s a reason to watch this above all, it’s Jackman. He’s such a marvelous song-and-dance ham that he rarely shifts into this gear, no less mesmerizing but far less razzle-dazzle. His outsized presence and natural beauty never overwhelms the character’s vanity and warped sense of morality. When things go belly up, he’s bursting to say something meaningful as a means to fight back. If only he had an original thought. —Fennessey</p>
<p>The Whistlers</p>
<p>Dir. by Corneliu Porumboiu</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>Corneliu Porumboiu made the most thoughtful cop movie of the millennium in 2009 with Police, Adjective, about a detective surveilling hapless teenage drug dealers in Bucharest. With The Whistlers, this wonderfully poker-faced filmmaker nods more overtly toward genre conventions while still subverting our expectations. On assignment in the Canary Islands, where he’s travelled to learn an obscure, whistling-based dialect that will help unlock a case on the homefront, Cristi (the great Romanian actor Vlad Ivanov) gets involved in local mob intrigue made incongruously glamorous by the exotic backdrop. Porumboiu’s deadpan sensibility is in evidence, cross-bred with a more accessible storytelling that almost suggests a kind of mainstream sellout … except that in the end, his deep fascination with intractable procedure, ethical crisis, and the vagaries of communication remains unchanged. —Nayman</p>
<p>The Invisible Man</p>
<p>Dir. by Leigh Whannell (Blumhouse)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>A showcase for Elisabeth Moss, perhaps the best American actress breathing, or at least the one who most effectively embodies trauma, rage, wit, and vengeance. Ostensibly a modernized remake of the Claude Rains horror classic, this Blumhouse reboot—itself a revamp after the disastrous “Dark Universe” experiment of … wait, that was only 2017?—is the best of the scrappy-and-bragging-about-it horror house. Leigh Whannell proved with 2018’s Cameron-esque Upgrade that tension and action are best served as a duo. What could have been a crass take on a survivor’s tale of abuse and stalking turns into something more visceral and intellectually realized, in part because of the filmmaker’s sense of staging, unusual robo-set pieces, and Moss’s astonishing embodiment of a paranoid woman on the brink. A great popcorn movie that’s even better if you give it a second thought. —Fennessey</p>
<p>Tommaso</p>
<p>Dir. by Abel Ferrara</p>

<p>Willem Dafoe can play anybody, including, it would seem, noted lunatic Abel Ferrara. As in the Ferrara-directed Pasolini, Dafoe shrinks a larger-than-life-auteur down to human dimensions while effacing his own celebrity; somehow, this most recognizable of art-house stars disappears. Because Tommaso surrounds its star with Ferrara’s real-life wife and daughter—placing them mostly on their domestic routine in a sunlit, top-floor Rome apartment—it’s tempting to read the film as a self-portrait of a New Yorker in exile. On that level, the material’s balance between self-aggrandizement and self-loathing is fascinating. But strip away the art-imitates-life gamesmanship and there are affecting universals here as well, about the mix of yearning and insecurity that comes with being an American abroad, and the struggle to reconcile destructive addictions (drugs and alcohol) with the obsessive, almost narcotic fixation required to create art. Bonus points for a Scorsese-homage finale that yields the year’s most hilariously over-the-top symbolism before an impossibly tender, personal coda; not only can Ferrara do strident and private, he doesn’t ask us to choose between the two. —Nayman</p>
<p>The Trip to Greece</p>
<p>Dir. by Michael Winterbottom</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>The quadrilogy no one asked for—and, for those of us who even know of its existence, are grateful to have—Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s travelogue series comes to a gentle, mournful conclusion. The celebrity impressions abound once more (Arnold! Begets! Werner!) as does the delicately arranged international coastal cuisine. But the two stars and its stalwart director have wrought a surprisingly tender series of films about male competition, insecurity, and reckoning. The finale is perhaps too maudlin, but never unnecessary. —Fennessey</p>
<p>Cane River</p>
<p>Dir. by Horace B. Jenkins (Oscilloscope)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: The Criterion Channel</p>
<p>Not technically a new movie, but still technically the freshest independent release of 2020. Produced and abandoned in 1982, Horace B. Jenkins’s Cane River was rediscovered and restored in 2014 by a crowd-funded preservation collective. Because Jenkins died shortly after finishing his debut, the film, which was made with an all-Black crew and cast and impressed Richard Pryor so much that he lobbied Warner Bros. to distribute it, has gradually taken on a mysterious, near-mythic status. Rereleased on Criterion this year, Cane River vindicates the hype, albeit in a disarmingly modest way. Jenkins’s story of a college football star who declines the NFL draft to return to his rural Louisiana community—where family business, tricky real estate deals, and romance await—unfolds with a gentle, music-drenched lyricism that feels more effortless than overtly masterful. —Nayman</p>
<p>Babyteeth</p>
<p>Dir. by Shannon Murphy (IFC)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>Australian director Shannon Murphy’s portrait of a young woman with a terminal illness (played by the frequently afflicted Eliza Scanlen) has a post-manic pixie dream girl anxiety—a rebuke to the oversimplified tales of whimsical love told from the perspective of a tragically perfect young woman. It reminded me a lot of Penelope Spheeris’s early films like Suburbia and The Decline of Western Civilization—intimate portraits of wastrels teens bound up by the contradictions of their own sincerity and cynicism. But despite its grave frame, it attempts to do something hopeful and puckishly optimistic. Bonus points for returning the undefeated Ben Mendelsohn to his native Australia for the first feature production since 2010’s Animal Kingdom. —Fennessey</p>
<p>The Last Dance</p>
<p>Dir. by Jason Hehir</p>
<p>Where to Watch: ESPN</p>
<p>Remember when we had five Sunday nights booked solid at the beginning of quarantine? Simpler, terrible times. With His Airness’s producorial participation, this wide-ranging documentary—both like a movie and a TV series—about the saga of Michael Jordan was not a wholly objective portrayal. If you can get over that existential necessity, The Last Dance blended nostalgia and monomania in a way that recalled Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator—in other words, glamour, success, iconography, and extraordinary wealth do not a happy man make. The pettiness and axe-grinding on display from MJ may have been decades in the making, but there hasn’t been an energy that more accurately reflects 2020. —Fennessey</p>
<p>Fourteen</p>
<p>Dir. by Dan Sallitt (Grasshopper)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Virtual Cinema</p>
<p>The New York–based writer-director Dan Sallitt makes movies that force you to meet them halfway, if not all the way across the street. The Unspeakable Act dramatized tortured incestuous yearning between a sister and her brother, and while there’s nothing so taboo in Fourteen, it’s still profoundly uncomfortable to watch wannabe writer Mara (Tallie Medel) drift away from her extroverted best friend Jo (Norma Kuhling), a bundle of raw, exposed nerves and fractured good intentions whose erratic lifestyle starts taking on the contours of a cautionary tale. Essentially a film about the ways in which we lose people—whether by accident, or an unconscious lack of hanging on, or both—Fourteen’s elliptical, time-jumping structure manifests a challenge to get on Sallitt’s impulsive, melancholy emotional wavelength. Climb aboard—the film is a bumpy, propulsive ride toward and through real pain. —Nayman</p>
<p>Blood Quantum</p>
<p>Dir. by Jeff Barnaby (Prospector Films)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Shudder</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of zombie movies in my day, but I’d never seen a zombie fish before—until the astonishing opening sequence of Jeff Barnaby’s latest, a rip-roaring undead story told from the perspective of an Indigenous tribe in Canada battling a horde of white zombies. The sociopolitical commentary isn’t hard to parse and this one is in the fine tradition of George Romero and David Cronenberg’s Rabid—white people are mindlessly killing and they must be destroyed. The Indigenous citizens of the Red River reserve are immune to the plague and must be God’s executioner. Barnaby bifurcates the movie into a prologue about the early days of the outbreak and the final days of the siege, effectively telling a family’s story in 96 minutes. The kills and tension are as effective as any big-budget horror flick (it took the filmmakers 12 years to raise the funds for this movie) and the ideas are deeper than the average. I can’t wait to see what Barnaby does next. —Fennessey</p>
<p>The Vast of Night</p>
<p>Dir. by Andrew Patterson</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Amazon</p>
<p>Here’s cause for celebration: a smart, genre-savvy, legitimately innovative low-budget thriller that plunges into the post–World War II past not simply to nostalgically celebrate its paranoid black-and-white sci-fi fantasies but to examine them. In a small town filling up with evidence of close encounters, a nerdy switchboard operator and an even geekier DJ team up, Scooby-Doo–style, to investigate, kicking off a ticking-clock, borderline-real-time story line that never lets us get too far ahead of the characters while playing on our Spielberg-sized expectations about where it’s going. In technical terms, from its roaming camerawork to its charming, precise production design, The Vast of Night is basically perfect. It’s a certainty that director Andrew Patterson will be getting offers to level up from studios and prestige TV networks; that’d be a case of virtue rewarded, and yet his debut has such real, plucky underdog appeal that it’d be nice to see him do a few more movies where less manages, almost heroically, to be more. —Nayman</p>
<p>Color Out of Space</p>
<p>Dir. by Richard Stanley (RLJE)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>Stuart Gordon died on March 24, 2020. He was one of my favorite filmmakers—a clever technician, hilarious synthesist, and master of low-budget horror ingenuity. Gordon’s best movies were his first two, Re-Animator and From Beyond, both H.P. Lovecraft adaptations. Gordon had an affinity for Lovecraft’s glandular prose, cosmic poetry, and sense of comic doom. Lovecraftian horror can be found everywhere—from the Alien franchise to John Carpenter’s The Thing to Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin—but the real deal is hard to come by. Nearly 10 years ago, when Guillermo del Toro’s long-threatened At the Mountains of Madness adaptation starring Tom Cruise died due to the filmmaker’s unwillingness to make a PG-13 version, my dream of Lovecraft on screen died, too. Lovecraft’s work is simultaneously evocative, ethereal, and, well, gross; it’s hard to make manifest. But the dream is resurrected in Color Out of Space, the first feature from Richard Stanley since he ignominiously vanished into the woods midway through the cursed production of the 1996 remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau. Stanley, like Gordon, is a physicalist, preferring practical effects and hardware to digital animation. This story of a family slowly becoming unglued after a bolt of light from space crashes into their backyard has all the paranoia and gooey discomfort that a Lovecraft promises. It also features Nicolas Cage yelling a lot. If this is your sort of thing, Color Out of Space is definitely your sort of thing. —Fennessey</p>
<p>I Was at Home, But…</p>
<p>Dir. by Angela Schanelec (Cinema Guild)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Not yet available at home</p>
<p>One afternoon, a hungry dog chases and catches a rabbit, and then … The way the title of German director Angela Schanelec’s latest trails off into infinity mirrors the style of a film that keeps introducing intriguing images and situations while delaying (or maybe abandoning?) traditional payoffs. The animal narrative disappears, replaced by a bizarre, unsettling story of a teenaged boy who returns balefully to his widowed mother after an unexplained absence. As a woman who may or not be broken before the film even begins, Maren Eggert is tense, inscrutable, and fully compelling; like the movie around her, she reveals by withholding. As Schanelec keeps bending her erratic protagonist’s life and choices into the shape of a question mark, Eggert’s nervy acting provides its own answer: If Astrid doesn’t know what she’s doing—or why—then why should we? For those who require closure and conventional coherence, I Was at Home, But… may resemble a nightmare; adventurous and attentive viewers, however, will feel right at home. —Nayman</p>
<p>Selah and the Spades</p>
<p>Dir. by Tayarisha Poe</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Amazon</p>
<p>I can still remember the first time I saw Bottle Rocket and tried to wrap my adolescent brain around what Wes Anderson was up to—a circadian rhythm I’d never experienced, patterns that were foreign but confident in their specificity. Was it good? Smart? Authentic? I dunno, but it worked on me. Poe’s debut is much the same, an insular but inviting look at a boarding school terrarium and its queen who warily rules the roost. Much like Rushmore, this is one of those films that, when Poe’s next project reaches a wider audience and greater acclaim, Selah fans will eagerly point to and say, “See, I told you …” So: I told you. —Fennessey</p>
<p>Vitalina Varela</p>
<p>Dir. by Pedro Costa (Grasshopper)</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Virtual Cinema</p>
<p>Art-house titans don’t come much more intimidating than the Portuguese auteur Pedro Costa, whose stark, monolithic movies wear their austerity as a badge of honor. But if Costa’s aesthetic—all long, static takes and ominous silences—can seem forbidding, his curiosity in and collaboration with his nonprofessional actors demonstrates a genuine tenderness. Vitalina Varela’s eponymous protagonist is a Cape Verdean woman playing herself in the midst of a homecoming to a Lisbon slum after the death of her estranged husband that doubles as our entry point into a cloistered, crumbling community. This subcultural portraiture is Costa’s stock in trade, and on some level, Vitalina Verela is a sequel-slash-companion to his earlier work. Yet for newcomers, its ardent, loving focus on its namesake as she wanders through dilapidated backdrops in search of catharsis could prove fully mesmerizing on its own terms. In literal terms, movies don’t get darker than this—the color palette is all slate greys and inky blacks—which is why its trajectory toward illumination, including the year’s most beautiful final shot, feels so potent. —Nayman</p>
<p>Shirley</p>
<p>Dir. by Josephine Decker</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Hulu</p>
<p>I saw this movie in a very hot, very packed theater at the Sundance Film Festival in January. (Remember movie theaters?) I sat in the front row, neck craned back for 107 uncomfortable minutes. I hated it. I needed a second viewing. Josephine Decker’s movies have a boundless, antiformal vitality, and this story of a young couple who come to live with the author Shirley Jackson and her husband, the literary critic and professor Stanley Edgar Hyman, is all nerves and sweat and bad juju. Not ideal for the way I saw it. But what Decker made me feel is sort of the point of Shirley, once again a stage for Elisabeth Moss to flex her skills, and to highlight the paradox of female creativity. Jackson was both the genius and the supplicant in her household, and Decker weaves a beguiling tale of power, sex, and what it means to be worthy of the artist’s lifestyle. I’m glad I watched it again. —Fennessey</p>
<p>Zombi Child</p>
<p>Dir. by Bertrand Bonello</p>
<p>Where to Watch: The Criterion Channel</p>
<p>As in his maddening, astonishing teen-terrorist drama Nocturama, Bertrand Bonello delights in pushing our collective buttons. Zombi Child centers the friendship of a bougie white French teenager with a Haitian-born classmate whose family history is steeped in Voodoo mythology. That the myth turns out to encompass apparently supernatural reality threatens to turn Zombi Child into a genre film, but Bonello is playing a different game; he’s fascinated by the dynamics of interracial friendship—the dance of presumption, curiosity, and discovery—and by the juxtaposition of the younger characters’ very contemporary (and economically high-end) coming of age with a flashback plot evoking the history of colonial subjugation and slavery. The mixing of tones between mystery, adolescent camaraderie, and national allegory is bold, and the results are imperfect—interestingly and maybe even admirably so. —Nayman</p>
<p>The Way Back</p>
<p>Dir. by Gavin O’Connor</p>
<p>Where to Watch: Streaming VOD</p>
<p>What once was conventional now seems antiquated. Such is the case for the latest act of self-conscious self-immolation from Ben Affleck. The actor has been encased in unspoken emotional terror for the better part of five years, constantly lampooned and memed for his own seeming midlife crisis, dotted with Dunkin’ Donuts Coolattas, back tats of ill repute, youngish girlfriends, and far-off gazes into the ocean. After laying down Bruce Wayne’s cape and cowl, he seemed to be an actor without a home. But Affleck is a scrupulous student of movie star power, and he softly paws at the Robert Redford playbook in The Way Back—weathered, regretful, taciturn. As a washed-out, alcoholic ex-college hoops phenom, Affleck seeks redemption when he takes over a head coaching gig for his alma mater’s ragtag basketball team. Think Bad News Bears meets The Lost Weekend.</p>
<p>Only, with O’Connor’s deeply sincere guiding style, he makes this straight-ahead movie something deeper and sadder. Affleck is one of the key American movie faces of the century, someone who has embodied every stage of fame and success, and backslid into all of its valleys right before our eyes. The male protagonists in O’Connor’s sports melodramas (Warrior; Miracle) are often physically imposing but repressed lost souls. Affleck’s Jack Cunningham—burly, dead-eyed, unmoored—is more than lost. There is, naturally, some redemption in this story, but not much by Hollywood standards. Is it a little self-indulgent and maudlin? Maybe so. Old-fashioned? Perhaps. But it’s also unafraid of being those things, and better for that, too. —Fennessey

<h3 id="second-verse-worse-than-the-first-five-iconic-80s-films-that-spawned-totally-needless-remakes">&ldquo;Second Verse, Worse Than the First: Five Iconic &rsquo;80s Films That Spawned Totally Needless Remakes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rcreader.com/sites/default/files/styles/inside/public/field/image/2020-06/poltergeist.jpg?itok=U-DBjv8p" alt="img">
Not all movie remakes are crummy, of course. As a recent subscriber, I&rsquo;ve finally been digging on HBO&rsquo;s reinvention of Watchmen, and I have nothing but praise for the Coen brothers' True Grit and Matt Reeves' chilly vampire thriller Let Me In and the umpteen takes on Little Women we&rsquo;ve gotten over the years. But while scrolling through my Netflix home page the other day, I landed on the title Arthur, and was stoked to be reunited with this beloved Dudley Moore vehicle from my youth when I took a closer look at the attached image. Ugh, I thought, it&rsquo;s the Russell Brand version. No thank you.</p>
<p>That discovery got me thinking about all the other wholly unnecessary remakes we&rsquo;ve been inundated with over the past dozen-or-so years – and for some reason, likely the nostalgic leanings of studio heads, most of those remakes were of works from the 1980s that should have been left well enough alone. (Not listed but considered: Ghostbusters, RoboCop, The Karate Kid, Annie &hellip; .) So here, with only side mention of the lesser films they inspired, are five more home-viewing options in lieu of open cineplexes: iconic, terrifically enjoyable &rsquo;80s flicks that all produced remakes that you&rsquo;ve probably, understandably forgotten about, if you even knew about them in the first place.</p>
<p>And we may as well start with the one that inspired this particular listicle … .</p>
<p>Arthur: Earlier this week, Tina Fey made headlines after announcing her accepted request to have four 30 Rock episodes pulled from digital platforms for having white characters appear in blackface. Whether you consider that decision an appropriate mea culpa or the emptiest of gestures is up to you. But the last time I watched a streaming presentation of writer/director Steve Gordon&rsquo;s Arthur, I remember feeling mildly surprised that the 1981 release was still allowed to be shown, and all because of one brief scene I&rsquo;d forgotten about: playboy Arthur Bach, drunk off his ass as usual, driving across a New York bridge while guzzling a bottle of wine. If this material is unfamiliar to you, that description might have you expecting a harrowing drama about the perils of alcoholism. (Was anyone killed due to Arthur&rsquo;s recklessness? Did he at least check into rehab?!) Ah, but no. The movie is a comedy, and that bridge scene was played for laughs, and Arthur not only wasn&rsquo;t rehabilitated, but walked away – or rather, stumbled away – with Liza Minnelli and three quarters of a billion dollars. In other words, politically correct Gordon&rsquo;s film is not, and I guess it makes sense that the tepid 2011 remake would water down the booze jokes and send Russell Brand&rsquo;s Arthur to an AA meeting. But I hope viewers don&rsquo;t completely forget about the original, because problematic or not, it&rsquo;s an absolute charmer, with Dudley Moore turning inebriated shtick (and an unforgettable cackle) into high art, Minnelli matching him wisecrack for wisecrack, and Oscar winner John Gielgud slipping the movie into his perfectly pressed breast pocket and casually strolling off with it. Asked if he&rsquo;ll prepare his master&rsquo;s bath, Gielgud&rsquo;s valet Hobson retorts, “It&rsquo;s what I live for.” That man&rsquo;s martini-dry readings are what I live for.</p>
<p>Fame: Considering it spawned a long-running 1980s network series, a couple of other TV reboots, and a 2009 screen remake that was rated PG (not even PG-13!), it&rsquo;s easy to mistakenly remember Fame as wholesome teen empowerment with a bunch of eager-beaver kids singing and dancing in the streets and on the tables of their cafeteria. But have you actually seen director Alan Parker&rsquo;s R-rated 1980 precursor? It&rsquo;s pretty raw … which I suppose should&rsquo;ve been expected given that its director was just coming off the wrenching Turkish-prison drama Midnight Express. The language strewn with F-bombs. The abortion subplot. The homophobia. The (blessedly off-screen) attack on the little girl. The scene of Leroy screaming at his teacher while her husband lays dying in a hospital bed. Not to mention that incredibly unpleasant sequence in which Coco unwisely meets a videographer for an &ldquo;audition&rdquo; in his studio apartment. Maybe, as the song goes, those students of New York City&rsquo;s High School of Performing Arts all thought they were “gonna live forever.” We viewers, however, were worried that some of them might not live at all, and returning to Parker&rsquo;s Fame now is to be reminded of how moody, troubling, and darkly electrifying so much of that film was, and how increasingly vapid and unmemorable its successors turned out to be. It&rsquo;s also somewhat ironic, as well as inevitable and sad, that none of the young performers from the 2009 Fame wound up amassing any fame for themselves, especially when you consider that the original&rsquo;s Barry Miller went on to win a Tony, Paul McCrane earned an Emmy, and Irene Cara – thanks to singing and co-writing the theme to Flashdance – scored a Grammy and an Oscar. Three performers; one EGOT. I guess those kids really did learn how to fly.</p>
<p>Footloose: To be clear, just because I&rsquo;ve labeled the films in this lineup “iconic” doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean I think they&rsquo;re great. Take this 1984 musical by director Herbert Ross, for instance. It&rsquo;s not great. I&rsquo;m not sure it even qualifies as good. But from the opening credits' cascade of happy feet to Kevin Bacon, at the finale, jumping into an explosion of glitter and shouting “Let&rsquo;s da-a-a-ance!!!”, Footloose is definitely a great time, and certainly a better one than we were given in the colorless 2011 remake. Just a few days ago, in my write-up on Grease, I called that film “a triumph of screen charisma over mediocre presentation (and common sense),” and the same could absolutely be said of this tale of The Town That Banned Dancing: Bacon as the almost comically acrobatic Ren; Lori Singer as the thrill-seeking, chicken-playing Ariel; Sarah Jessica Parker and Chris Penn as the leads' best buddies; the braying John Lithgow and subtly steely Dianne Wiest as the town&rsquo;s fire-and-brimstone minister and his wife. They&rsquo;re all outstanding, and collectively make a solid case for the film&rsquo;s performers saving the show. But the contributions of Ross, who was a Broadway dancer and choreographer before he became an Oscar-nominated film director, shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted. True, he can&rsquo;t do anything to redeem the silliness of Footloose&rsquo;s setup or its formulaic and sentimental detours. Ross clearly loves bodies in motion, though, and even when his movie&rsquo;s dance numbers border on the ridiculous – or, in the case of Ren&rsquo;s solo in the abandoned warehouse, ludicrous – his camera is alive to the movement and keeps us riveted … and, on more than a few occasions, laughing. That scene of Penn&rsquo;s Willard gradually discovering rhythm might mark the late, lamented actor&rsquo;s finest screen moment. Let&rsquo;s hear it for that boy!</p>
<p>Poltergeist: So here&rsquo;s an embarrassing admission: The 2015 remake of director Tobe Hooper&rsquo;s and co-writer/producer Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s 1982 horror smash is apparently so forgettable that I forgot I liked it. Seriously, I just went back to re-read what I wrote about the movie five years ago, and was startled to discover that I evidently really enjoyed myself – which is astonishing given that I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve thought about the film, and certainly haven&rsquo;t seen it, even once over the past few years. Perhaps that&rsquo;s just a testament, though, to the lingering power of Hooper&rsquo;s original, which might be the most purely upsetting PG-rated fright flick in the genre&rsquo;s history. (And yes, I am counting that nightmare-inducing 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.) Despite my then-praise and continued fondness for stars Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt, I can&rsquo;t recall a single image from the box-office fizzle that was 2015&rsquo;s Poltergeist. But while repeat viewings have certainly contributed to my recollection, I can vividly picture just about every scare that Hooper dropped onto an unwitting 13-year-old in the summer of &lsquo;82, primarily because most of them involved kids even younger than me. Poor little Carol Anne, of course, got sucked into the closet and then into the TV, and her unseen shrieks as she tried to evade an otherworldly creature have rung in my brain for 38 years running. (Knowing that the child&rsquo;s portrayer Heather O&rsquo;Rourke died at age 12 makes her screen time all the sadder, especially when the ghosts return and Carol Anne plaintively begs, “No more.”) Oh, but the traumatic terrors inflicted on Oliver Robins&rsquo; pre-teen Robbie! Wasn&rsquo;t it enough that the tree outside his window tried to eat him? Did he really have to be yanked under his bed by that freaking clown doll, too?!</p>
<p>The Thing: I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those grumpy old farts who thinks science-fiction and horror movies were better before the advent of CGI, but … weren&rsquo;t they? When 2011&rsquo;s take on John Carpenter&rsquo;s sci-fi/horror gross-out The Thing was released, I thought it was adequate enough. But once computers became primarily responsible for supplying visual effects, those effects lost their ability to astound; there was occasional shock in the 2011 film, but little awe. Comparatively, Carpenter&rsquo;s animatronic effects, with their nearly tactile viscera, produced loads of awe – and also a whole lot of “Ew-w-w-w!” A classic tale of paranoia that finds Kurt Russell and other members of an Antarctic research team potentially infested with extraterrestrial … things … this gore-splattered freakout boasts a bunch of unforgettable bits: the dog that basically turns itself inside out; the phenomenally intense blood-testing sequence; that guy getting his face stretched out of proportion by Wilford Brimley. (No number of Cocoon viewings or Quaker Oats commercials ever erased that image from memory.) Yet when I first saw the movie in 1982, nothing amazed or affected me quite like The Head, which is still the first – practically the only – thing I think about in connection to Carpenter&rsquo;s achievement. Picture: I&rsquo;m a 14-year-old at the drive-in with my parents and younger siblings. We&rsquo;ve just seen TRON (another &rsquo;80s title unnecessarily rebooted for the 21st century). We&rsquo;re halfway into the R-rated sci-fi I coerced my parents into letting us see. And halfway through, a man&rsquo;s head literally tears itself off his body, sprouts legs, and skitters across the floor. Viewing the sight, co-star David Clennon, his mouth agape, says, “You gotta be f&mdash;in' kidding.” Sitting in the car with my parents, I didn&rsquo;t say that myself. But I was definitely f&mdash;&lsquo;in thinking it.

<h3 id="director-kenny-ortega-on-the-queer-aesthetic-of-his-movies-from-hocus-pocus-to-high-school-musical">&ldquo;Director Kenny Ortega on the Queer Aesthetic of His Movies From ‘Hocus Pocus’ to ‘High School Musical’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kenny-ortega-walk-of-fame-honor.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
Yes, there’s John Waters, Gus Van Sant, Pedro Almodovar, Lee Daniels, Gregg Araki, Kimberly Peirce, Lisa Cholodenko and Dee Rees. But there’s at least one other director who deserves to be included in that group of barrier-breaking LGBTQ filmmakers: Kenny Ortega.</p>
<p>Ortega, one of this year’s honorees on Variety’s Power of Pride list, made movies that queer kids could relate to, even if they didn’t know they were queer when they were watching them.</p>
<p>In 1992’s “Newsies,” Ortega discovered Christian Bale as a young actor, casting him as the star of Disney’s live-action musical about singing Manhattan newspaper delivery boys during the newsboys’ strike of 1899. The movie was so far ahead of its time that — despite soft box office receipts — it inspired a hit Broadway musical two decades later. Ortega next engineered the 1993 cult family comedy “Hocus Pocus,” with Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as the cackling witches known as the Sanderson sisters.</p>
<p>And in 2006, Ortega launched Zac Efron and “High School Musical” trilogy on the Disney Channel, at the time the most successful TV movie ever with its soundtrack of songs (“We’re All In This Together”) that became the next “Grease” for a generation of tweens.</p>
<p>In his own life, the 70-year-old Ortega had ambitions of being an actor — starring in a touring production of “Hair” — before he moved on to becoming an award-winning choreographer (with one of his many credits being 1987’s “Dirty Dancing”) and director. On a recent day, Ortega spoke to Variety in a far-ranging interview about his career.</p>
<p>Congratulations on being named to our Power of Pride list. Do you have a message to LGBTQ youth?</p>
<p>Kenny Ortega: There are some interesting things that have happened in my life as a gay man. But I would say, “Continue to carry the torch.” There have been lives lost in the quest for change and acceptance, and many soldiers that have spent years working to create a world where we can walk freely and without discrimination.</p>
<p>So, just don’t forget the history and what it’s taken to get to where we are, and that we need to get further. It’s up to our young people to continue to carry that torch.</p>
<p>What do you remember from your acting career?</p>
<p>I nearly had my life taken away from me when I was 21-years-old by a crooked police officer, the chief of police in South Carolina, while I was starring in the American tribal love rock musical “Hair.”</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>They didn’t want us in South Carolina. They didn’t want us in Florida. They didn’t want us in Oklahoma. In Tulsa, where the KKK jumped on the stage, we were being chased and picked out of restaurants and discriminated against and being threatened. There was fear about what this show talked about and sang about. I played a character that was bisexual, and this chief of police did not like what I stood for and did not like that we were there. And he planted enough narcotics in my hotel room to make me out to be a major drug dealer. And I was arrested and facing 25-years-to-life.</p>
<p>It was at the top of Variety: “‘Hair’ actor arrested on drug charges.” It was right on the front page. And I spent weeks in jail and thousands of dollars for representation. And in court, it all came out. He was removed from office. I was freed, given a police escort to the airport and I was able to rejoin my company.</p>
<p>How did this police officer plant drugs on you?</p>
<p>I was onstage opening night. He was in the audience. No one knew it. He was a balding man, and I introduced myself as George Berger [his character]. And I jumped off the stage wearing hardly anything and climbed over the audience. And I picked him to sit in front of, and I kissed him on his bald head. And I called him “Mother.” And he decked me, and I fell backward out of my chair. The whole show stopped, and the cast jumped off the stage.</p>
<p>Then, days later — after our final performance — when we’re heading to New Orleans, we went back to the hotel to pack up our belongings and get into the buses. As I walked into my hotel room, I was thrown up against a wall, my hands thrown behind my back, and the next thing I knew I was in jail and being told that I was arrested on narcotics charges, which was a joke. We couldn’t travel with narcotics. We were traveling through the South and the Midwest and across state lines.</p>
<p>So anyway, what was so beautiful was that the judge, she came to see the final performance. Her daughters had seen the show multiple times. And when she saw the show and heard about what happened to me, she thought something was up, and she did some digging. And first of all, he arrested me under the name of George Berger. He thought that’s who I was, because we broke the fourth wall.</p>
<p>People came forward and basically sort of threw him under the bus and said, “Yeah, he told us to do this and asked us to do that. And we put this in Kenny’s room and that in Kenny’s room.”</p>
<p>The entire thing was just — it was unbelievable. It was a horror story that just had this incredible bright ending in that the whole thing was thrown out of court. He was removed from office. I was set free, but never to be the same. Christ, I’m still always looking over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Had you come out of the closet?</p>
<p>Months later, I’m in Los Angeles in the show, and my publicity folks come to me and say, “The Advocate, the gay and lesbian periodical, is looking for actors that will come out, that we need soldiers to come out and stand for change.” And I thought, “Well, I’ve been singing for change for almost three years. I’d be a hypocrite If I said no.” And after long thought, my best friend and I, we came out on the front pages of The Advocate.</p>
<p>I was 21, 22-years-old. I’ve never regretted it, and I knew that at that time that there could be discrimination in the job, that as an actor that I might not get hired, that as a hopeful choreographer that I might be looked over. But I never regretted the choice and along with my brothers and sisters took arms and stood strong and raised my voice and managed to get to the ground that I’m standing on today. It wasn’t without a fight. And it wasn’t without putting myself at risk.</p>
<p>Did you initially feel like you were accepted in Hollywood for being gay?</p>
<p>No. I’ve got to tell you though, I would have never have dreamed that I would see the day. I was at McConnell’s ice cream parlor with a friend before the quarantine, and we were standing in line to get our favorite ice cream. And in walks these teenage boys, like six teenage boys, and they’re laughing and holding hands. And it is clear to me that they are gay young men and that they’re comfortable in their skin and in their shoes. Then they noticed me and they were like, “Oh, my gosh. It’s Kenny Ortega.”</p>
<p>I pulled them aside, and I said, “It’s just so exciting to be able to see you guys walk in with this kind of comfort and confidence, that you’re not even having to think twice about who you are or that anybody would have a problem with it.”</p>
<p>And I said, “Just remember that it wasn’t always that way.”</p>
<p>Do you think there’s a queer aesthetic that runs through all your movies?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. I do, because that’s who I am. I put a lot of who I am into my work. I mean, really all the way back from the earliest work that I’ve done, even as a choreographer in film and television. And I think, yeah, that it’s just there, and whether it’s screaming at you, or whether it’s just sort of quietly there, it’s there.</p>
<p>The character of Ryan [played by Lucas Grabeel] in “High School Musical,” Sharpay’s twin brother, we decided he’d probably going to come out in college. It was less about coming out and just more about letting his true colors come forward.</p>
<p>Would it have been possible when you made “High School Musical” to have had Ryan be openly gay?</p>
<p>I have to be honest with you. I didn’t think at the time — and Disney is the most progressive group of people I’ve ever worked with.</p>
<p>I was concerned because it was family and kids, that Disney might not be ready to cross that line and move into that territory yet. So, I just took it upon myself to make choices that I felt that those who were watching would grab. They would see it, they would feel it, they would know it and they would identify with it. And that is what happened.</p>
<p>Are there cues like that in your other movies, like “Hocus Pocus”?</p>
<p>The fun of “Hocus Pocus” is — I mean, the girls are almost drag queens. I pushed for them to go there and kind of felt that we have an audience if they did, and God knows we did. They’re beloved characters and emulated all the time. Every Halloween, they’re knocking on my door. Those Sanderson sisters are back.</p>
<p>There’s just kind of a spirit and a fun that is representative of my own spirit and fun that lives under some of my work. And that makes it, I think, queer-friendly — if that’s a good way to put it. And I think that there has been so much progress that you can actually say that now, and people won’t freak out. Because it used to be people, they’d be like, “Oh, no! What is he trying this message to children?”</p>
<p>I have to say thousands of kids that have said, “If it weren’t for ‘High School Musical,’ I don’t know that I would have ever been comfortable in my skin. I don’t know when I would have been able to feel comfortable enough to come out, embrace who I am.”</p>
<p>One of my favorite movies growing up was “Newsies,” which was the first movie that you directed.</p>
<p>That’s correct. It was a big, big project to be thrown into as a first-time filmmaker. And I think that, at the end, I would have wanted to accomplish more. But I believe that there was something special there that jumped off the screen in the performances of those young men, and that I felt that the musical and production work in it was deserving of attention. I was brokenhearted when it didn’t receive it.</p>
<p>But then I started to hear that it’s in the movie theaters. And then suddenly there were like these groups of people that were like fan bases. And over the years, it just kept getting bigger and bigger until the point where it became a kind of a cult film. Then, of course, they took “Newsies” and turned it into a Broadway musical. And I thought, “Well, there you go.” Sometimes things just take their time.</p>
<p>“Hocus Pocus,” same thing. They released “Hocus Pocus” in the summer, a Halloween movie in the summer. And I remember one review that came out that said, “The problem with the movie is Kenny didn’t know if he was making a movie for kids or for adults.” I was like, “No, I was making a movie for everybody.” I was going for something that I thought was a bit of a hybrid that could entertain a wider audience, and that it took though a long time for it to find that audience and to be able to accomplish that goal. And now it certainly has.

<h3 id="nascar-and-hollywood-were-never-the-same-after-days-of-thunder">&ldquo;NASCAR and Hollywood were never the same after &lsquo;Days of Thunder&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0624%2Fr712061_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg" alt="img">
Depending on whom you ask in Hollywood, &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; is either the quintessential &rsquo;80s/&rsquo;90s action drama or the movie that broke the system, forever changing the way filmmaking is done. Depending on whom you ask in the NASCAR garage, &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; either made stock car racing look forever cool or clumsily taught an entire generation little more than how to use Sweet&rsquo;N Low packets to illustrate the aerodynamic draft.</p>
<p>No matter where they stand when it comes to those debates, there&rsquo;s a pretty good chance that if they are surfing through their cable channels this summer and &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; pops up, they&rsquo;ll stop flipping long enough to hear Robert Duvall say, &ldquo;Rubbin&rsquo;, son, is racing.&rdquo; Or Tom Cruise exclaim, &ldquo;Hit the pace car?!&rdquo; Or Nicole Kidman shout at her soon-to-be husband, &ldquo;Let may outta tha cahr, Cole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, yes, to watch that scene with the Sweet&rsquo;N Low packets.</p>
<p>In honor of the film&rsquo;s 30th anniversary, we tracked down the filmmakers, actors and racers who lived those &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; to re-create that journey, down roads that took us into the wall at Darlington or into the haze of a late-night party in a Daytona Beach gentlemen&rsquo;s club parking lot. Why? Because we know that if we go to the outside, we can hold it. Harry Hogge said so.</p>

<p>The power of Tom Cruise | A game-changing deal</p>
<p>How Cruise convinced NASCAR | A &lsquo;graveyard&rsquo; of wrecks</p>
<p>A script in flux | Wild nights on set</p>
<p>Box-office flop? | A new generation &hellip; and sequel?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m dropping the hammer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; starts at Daytona International Speedway with a chill-bump-inducing, Hans Zimmer-scored sequence that builds from sunrise to the green flag of the 1990 edition of the Great American Race. But the story of &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; began across the street four years earlier in an Olive Garden.</p>
<p>Rick Hendrick, owner, Hendrick Motorsports: I was still racing sports cars then and met Paul Newman, who was a very good race car driver. He&rsquo;d just shot &ldquo;The Color of Money&rdquo; with Tom Cruise and had gotten Tom into driving sports cars. So we started meeting up to do some driving, and Tom became a friend. We were at Daytona testing our Busch [now Xfinity] Series car, and they came out to the track, so we put Tom in that car, and he just took off. He loved it.</p>
<p>Tom Cruise, aka Cole Trickle (interviewed for ESPN The Magazine in 2015): I had driven some incredible machines with Paul and Rick before that, but the sensation of driving one of Rick&rsquo;s stock cars around Daytona, that was an entirely different level. I think I hit 175 mph. The second I climbed out of that car on pit road, I said, &ldquo;We have to make a movie about this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geoff Bodine, driver of Hendrick&rsquo;s No. 5 Chevy: That night we went to dinner with them, Rick and me and the crew, and we told story after story. Cruise was just riveted, man. This was the most famous guy in the world, and he barely said anything. He was just listening and smiling the whole time.</p>
<p>Chris Connelly, ESPN, then with Premiere Magazine and MTV: It&rsquo;s difficult to remember a time when an actor had more momentum than Tom Cruise did right then. That very year, 1986, he starred in both &ldquo;The Color of Money&rdquo; and &ldquo;Top Gun.&rdquo; Then he headlined &ldquo;Cocktail&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rain Man,&rdquo; a Best Picture winner. While those two films were in theaters, he was shooting &ldquo;Born on the Fourth of July&rdquo; with director Oliver Stone, which earned him his first Oscar nomination. Tom Cruise had the power to do whatever movie he wanted. And he wanted to make a NASCAR movie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you built the car, I&rsquo;d get a damn driver&rsquo;</p>
<p>Equally unstoppable was the powerhouse producing duo of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who had worked with Cruise on &ldquo;Top Gun&rdquo; and overseen pop culture sensation &ldquo;Flashdance&rdquo; and a pair of &ldquo;Beverly Hills Cop&rdquo; movies starring Eddie Murphy. Simpson was a bona fide Hollywood wild man, an Alaska-raised former head of Paramount Pictures. Bruckheimer was a Detroit-raised advertising man who had transitioned to feature films. They were known as &ldquo;Mr. Inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Outside,&rdquo; Simpson bringing the Hollywood Rolodex while Bruckheimer delivered a get-your-hands-dirty knowledge of film production. They were the perfect yin and yang. They famously shared an office with desks facing each other, where they had just signed an unprecedented five-year, five-film, $300 million deal with Paramount.</p>
<p>Cruise was the biggest thing in show business in the late &rsquo;80s. After he got the hang of sports car driving and insisted upon a movie, who could say no? Paramount/Everett Collection</p>
<p>Connelly: They called it the &ldquo;visionary alliance.&rdquo; Here is the money, make five movies, whatever movies you want to make, however you want to slice up that financial pie. They were given free range. They described their relationship with the studio as, &ldquo;We meet them at the premiere.&rdquo; So there was a lot of attention paid to what the first film of that alliance was going to be.</p>
<p>Jerry Bruckheimer: Tom brought the idea of &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; to us. Everyone knows the line from &ldquo;Top Gun&rdquo;: &ldquo;I feel the need for speed,&rdquo; right? Well, that&rsquo;s Tom, quite literally. No one takes it to the limit like Tom. He wanted the audience to experience auto racing like it had never been done before, like he had on the racetrack. But the movie couldn&rsquo;t be just about fast cars. There had to be characters that the audience could connect with and a story that brought those characters and those cars to life.</p>
<p>Cruise had already conceived the bones of that story, about an Indy car driver transitioning to stock car racing, dueling with a bitter rival while overcoming the physical and mental aftermath of a big crash. But his first draft was admittedly flat. Oscar-winning screenwriter Donald E. Stewart (for 1982&rsquo;s &ldquo;Missing&rdquo;) took a stab at the script. So did Warren Skaaren, writer of the original &ldquo;Top Gun&rdquo; screenplay who had just written Michael Keaton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Batman.&rdquo; But those treatments were still missing the mark, and while Cruise was busy with &ldquo;Rain Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;Born on the Fourth of July,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t have time to babysit rewrites.</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: We needed someone that we knew would completely immerse himself in the NASCAR world. If you know the work of Robert Towne, then you know that&rsquo;s how he approaches any script. He did a true deep dive into the lives of the drivers, the teams, every aspect of that world.</p>
<p>Towne was 54 years old and already a living Hollywood legend. He&rsquo;d helped craft the scripts for &ldquo;Bonnie and Clyde&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Godfather&rdquo;; had won the 1974 Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Jack Nicholson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chinatown,&rdquo; still considered one of the greatest screenplays ever written; and had just written and directed &ldquo;Tequila Sunrise&rdquo; starring Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell and Michelle Pfeiffer. Towne was also at the peak of his movie-making powers.</p>
<p>To recruit Towne, Cruise took the writer to a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race at Watkins Glen on Aug. 13, 1989.</p>
<p>Dr. Jerry Punch, ESPN pit reporter and film technical adviser: I came in early on race morning and I was introduced to these two guys who were going to be part of my crew during the race. One was in his 50s and had a beard and the other was this little guy with scruff on his face, sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face. I figured it was a college kid looking to earn 75 bucks, but it was Tom Cruise. Robert Towne was the older guy and had a little microphone pinned to the brim of his ball cap, and it was hooked to a tape recorder he was carrying. He was recording everything: conversations, dialects, sayings, stories, the sounds of the pits &ndash; all of it.</p>
<p>Richard Petty, NASCAR legend: We talked for a long time. I&rsquo;d just had my big crash at Daytona, the one when I barrel-rolled down the frontstretch. They wanted to know all about that deal. They couldn&rsquo;t believe that I stayed awake the whole time and remembered the whole thing, like it happened in slow motion. When I told them that I&rsquo;d gone blind for a little bit, that seemed to really get the writer&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Punch: They managed to stay undercover until about halfway through the race. It got really hot and Cruise took off his hat and sunglasses for a minute, just to wipe the sweat off his face. A camera guy spotted him and all of a sudden there he was, up on the big TV screen and it said, &ldquo;Welcome, Tom Cruise!&rdquo; The crowd went crazy, and suddenly everyone was coming for him. Tom said, &ldquo;Sorry, Doc, we gotta go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Petty&rsquo;s 1988 crash at the Daytona 500 was the source of great intrigue for Cruise and Towne. ISC Archives/Getty Images</p>
<p>Hendrick: Tom brought Robert to our race shops in Concord, North Carolina, and introduced us. It felt like Robert was here all the time after that, listening and asking questions about what we did and why we did it.</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: Don Simpson and I came out to Charlotte too. We brought Tony Scott, who had directed &ldquo;Top Gun&rdquo; for us, and we all met with Rick Hendrick and his people to talk about supplying race cars for the film. He gave us the keys to the kingdom. We don&rsquo;t make &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; without Rick Hendrick&rsquo;s cooperation, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Dale Earnhardt Jr., NASCAR star and son of Dale Sr.: They came to see Dad at his office. Me and [my sister] Kelley went up there just to get a look at Tom Cruise. I guess I was 14 or 15. They met with Dad for probably 30 minutes in his office. The word on the street was always that they had offered him the role of Rowdy Burns but he turned it down because he didn&rsquo;t want to play the bad guy. I never found out if it was true or not. But it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Rowdy Burns is based on The Intimidator.</p>
<p>Michael Rooker, aka Rowdy Burns: Oh yeah, Earnhardt was the pattern. That&rsquo;s pretty obvious, right? I got to see him up close, in real life and in his element. He&rsquo;s the guy who knows that every time he walks in the room he is immediately the biggest badass in that room. But I wasn&rsquo;t trying to &ldquo;do Dale Earnhardt&rdquo; like a carbon copy. I was trying to capture what he was all about. Plus, I didn&rsquo;t want to copy him straight up because I sure didn&rsquo;t want to piss him off. [Laughs]</p>
<p>Rooker was joined by up-and-comer John C. Reilly as mechanic Buck Bretherton; Randy Quaid as car salesman-turned-NASCAR team owner Tim Daland; and Cary Elwes, he of recent &ldquo;Princess Bride&rdquo; fame, as Trickle&rsquo;s new teammate and Hardee&rsquo;s-sponsored weasel Russ Wheeler. The female lead, neurosurgeon Dr. Claire Lewicki, was awarded to relatively unknown Nicole Kidman, who met Cruise on set and married him less than two years later.</p>
<p>But the coup was landing Robert Duvall, who had not been able to come to terms with Francis Ford Coppola to reprise his role as mafia confidant Tom Hagen in &ldquo;The Godfather: Part III,&rdquo; shooting at the same time as &ldquo;Days of Thunder.&rdquo; Instead, he was coming south to play crew chief Harry Hogge, based on real-life NASCAR crew chief Harry Hyde.</p>
<p>Hendrick: The scene at the start of the movie, when Randy Quaid, the car salesman, asks Robert Duvall, the old retired crew chief, to help him start a NASCAR team, that really happened. It was me and Harry Hyde, and that talk took place right there in that same spot where I introduced Robert Towne to Harry; land that was his is where our race shops are now. Well, Harry, he liked to talk. And Robert, he likes to listen. I left them down there for a couple of days with Harry telling stories, and by the time Harry was done with Robert they had written a movie where the crew chief was the hero and the smartest guy in the movie. They even named him Harry!</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: Duvall wasn&rsquo;t available to do any script readings during preproduction, so we had other actors sitting in with Tom to read the scenes between Cole and Harry. It just didn&rsquo;t work. I went to Robert Towne and said, &ldquo;Hey, Robert, I&rsquo;m sorry, but these scenes aren&rsquo;t working.&rdquo; He told me to wait until Duvall got there. As soon as Robert Duvall arrived, he started reading those scenes with Tom and it was amazing. I was so relieved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;OK &hellip; Big John&rsquo;s turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Cruise and Towne became constants around NASCAR tracks and the race shops around Charlotte, Simpson and Bruckheimer flew to Daytona Beach to join Cruise at NASCAR headquarters for a meeting with epically stoic NASCAR chairman Bill France Jr. France went through the list of films that NASCAR had cooperated on in the past, and they had all been bad. He specifically mentioned 1965&rsquo;s &ldquo;Red Line 7000,&rdquo; which was so awful that NASCAR star Curtis Turner stood up during the premiere and shouted to fellow racer Tiny Lund, &ldquo;Goddamn it, this is terrible! Tiny, let&rsquo;s get the hell out of here!&rdquo; and walked out of the theater.</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: That conversation with NASCAR, that was not easy. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t hurt to have Tom Cruise in the room with you. NASCAR saw Tom&rsquo;s enthusiasm, and they saw that Rick Hendrick was behind the project.</p>
<p>Cruise: I think about that discussion, really all of the discussions that we had with NASCAR and the racers themselves, and I go back to Cole&rsquo;s promise to Harry before the final race of the movie: &ldquo;Just let me drive. I won&rsquo;t make a fool out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: I think about the meeting that you see in the film, when the president of NASCAR meets with Rowdy and Cole. There is no question in that meeting who is calling the shots, who is really in charge. That&rsquo;s exactly what that meeting with NASCAR felt like. Especially when we asked to have cars on the racetrack in live racing conditions. Thankfully they said yes.</p>
<p>Greg Sacks, NASCAR driver and &ldquo;Days&rdquo; camera car driver: I still can&rsquo;t believe that NASCAR agreed to that, to let cars with cameras in them qualify and run in actual Cup Series races &hellip; and I was one of the guys driving the cars!</p>
<p>Punch: They shot the movie for several months in Daytona, and it became commonplace to hear sirens all over town, escorting Tom Cruise to wherever he was going. It got to be a joke. &ldquo;That must be Cruise.&rdquo; Well, one night Bill France Jr. was having dinner with the movie folks and he knew Cruise was going to be there, so he got the Daytona International Speedway security to escort him to that dinner with all of their sirens blaring and everything. It was a joke, but it was also a little reminder to let Cruise know that Bill Jr. was still the man in this town.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna give you an engine, low to the ground &hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Production began on Aug. 26, 1989. That&rsquo;s when Tony Scott came to Bristol Motor Speedway to shoot a handful of racing scenes &hellip; and ended up surrounding the half-mile oval with multiple cameras and shooting hours of footage. Unintentionally, Scott had on day one already set the tone for how the entire &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; production was going to go. Big, big and bigger.</p>
<p>Before entering their cars in real races, Scott and his crew started shooting film sequences on their own. They raced and wrecked cars at eight Winston Cup tracks, a pair of lower-level short tracks and a Florida air strip, plus on the sands of Daytona Beach.</p>
<p>With a virtually limitless budget, director Tony Scott wrecked dozens of cars in pursuit of the right shots. Paramount/Everett Collection</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: Someone was working on a race car somewhere 24 hours a day. We would shoot with them at the racetrack, wreck them all and load them up on transporters to be hauled back over to Hendrick Motorsports. They would work on them all night, get them fixed and send them back. Then we would wreck them all over again. I think we built 60 cars, and I think we ended up with zero.</p>
<p>Hendrick: Oh, they definitely wound up with zero. I know because at one point we had most of them lined up behind the building, a &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; graveyard out there reminding me how much money it was costing. At one point, we had to meet with them and say, &ldquo;Guys, this is great stuff. But we can&rsquo;t keep up this pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan Padelford, stunt driver: The general manager at Hendrick Motorsports was Jimmy Johnson, not the champion driver, the executive, and he was assigned to help us out, to give us anything we needed. I loved Jimmy. He made it all work. But I also felt so bad for him. Every night we sent him a fleet of cars to fix. Chassis parts smashed, engines blown, everything. One time I broke a rocker arm in the engine of my car and Jimmy took me over to the shed where Rick Hendrick kept his drag racing boats. We took a rocker arm off of one of those boats and put it in my car.</p>
<p>Padelford was only one of dozens of stunt drivers, but his role was the most important. He was the driver, and inventor, of the high-speed C2 Chase Car. He was frustrated with the standard clunky camera trucks, limited on speed and stuck with an elevated camera angle via a camera operator strapped into the bed of the truck. So Padelford modified a low-slung El Camino chassis and gave it a Corvette 427 engine &ndash; the perfect machine to keep up with and film a pack of Winston Cup cars, driven by a mix of stuntmen and real NASCAR racers Greg Sacks, Bobby Hamilton, Tommy Ellis, Hut Stricklin and Rick Mast.</p>
<p>Padelford: It was really low to the ground, and the camera in the back was even lower. It was so fast that it was too dangerous for a man to be buckled in the back, so I developed hand controls that let the camera operator ride shotgun up front, watching monitors and controlling the camera in the back. When Tony reached out to me to say he was making a NASCAR movie, he said, &ldquo;We are really going to push the limit with these cars, so we need a rig like nothing ever used before.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already ahead of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sacks: Those on-track shoots were all choreographed. Controlled chaos. Tony Scott would be on pit road at Daytona with all of us crowded around him, he&rsquo;d have his shirt off and he had Matchbox cars lined up on a table, showing us exactly what he wanted us to do on the track, all in that British accent of his. We would roll out some of the cars with cameras bolted all over them and the camera car right in the middle of us, and we would perform these dances. Meanwhile, Tony was on the radio in our ears, &ldquo;Move over here! OK, now you pass him there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rooker: For the big crash where Cole and Rowdy get hurt, they had one car rigged with explosives that would fire a section of a telephone pole out of the bottom and launch the car into the air. I&rsquo;ve never seen a car barrel roll like that one did, and when it finally stopped, there was nothing left. It was just a smoking pile of twisted metal. Then a stuntman popped out of it, screaming, &ldquo;F&mdash; yeah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padelford: We had a sequence where we were supposed to drive up through the pack. One of the race cars following us as it was making its way up to the lead. I totally lost control as we entered a turn and completely spun into the infield grass, just looping it. My camera operator shouts to me, &ldquo;When you make that move, it causes the camera to really pan hard to the left!&rdquo; He was wanting me to correct the move I was making. I just yelled back, &ldquo;Yeah, OK, I&rsquo;m working on it!&rdquo; He was so locked in to getting the shot that he had no idea we were wrecking.</p>
<p>Footage came through a combination of real NASCAR drivers in actual Cup races and innovative rigs conceived by the likes of Allan Padelford. ISC Images/Getty Images</p>
<p>During 1990 Daytona Speedweeks, the movie cars were in the Winston Cup garage, being prepped, qualified and raced for real, their bumpers hiding cameras to capture legit in-race action. But they had to qualify for the races on speed, just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Rusty Wallace, NASCAR driver and performer of one line in &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo;: A lot of guys were pissed about that, movie cars being on the track. I know Earnhardt wasn&rsquo;t happy about it. But I thought it was great, as long they didn&rsquo;t get in my way.</p>
<p>Rick Mast, NASCAR driver and &ldquo;Days&rdquo; movie car driver: My car was fast in practice. I was thinking, &ldquo;Damn, I&rsquo;ve got a car that could win the Daytona 500!&rdquo; We had a meeting with Mr. France, all of us driving the movie cars. He talked to us about what a big deal this movie was but that we were to stay the hell out of the way when the races started, pass no one. I raised my hand and I said, &ldquo;Mr. France, if it gets late in the race and I think I have a chance to win the Daytona 500 &hellip;&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Rick, I know you are working hard to make it full time in NASCAR. Well, I run NASCAR and I own most of the NASCAR tracks, so I can guarantee you that if you pass one car out there, you will absolutely never make it in NASCAR.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I&rsquo;m driving, I&rsquo;ve got a guy on the radio who talks to me&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the mechanics at Hendrick Motorsports were up all night fixing cars, Towne was up all night fixing the script. When actors reported for duty on set the next morning, Towne handed them new pages of just-dreamt-up dialogue, much of it changed mere moments earlier when Sacks, Hendrick or Punch would advise, &ldquo;Hey, a real racer would never say it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cruise: I tried taping the new lines to the dashboard of the race car. I was out there driving at 130 mph in a pack with cameras bolted to the car, so the weight was all over the place. I was looking around all over trying to read these new lines, and I totally hit the wall. So we changed the approach and I started having Bob [Towne] feed me the new lines through my radio earpiece. In the movie, when you see me listening intently to my crew chief giving me instructions, that was for real. I was actually listening to Bob Towne giving me the next line.</p>
<p>The only chunks of the script that weren&rsquo;t changed were the best stories handed to Towne and Cruise by the NASCAR community, many of them with roots back to that very first storytelling dinner at Olive Garden four years earlier.</p>
<p>Bodine: Every big disagreement between Robert Duvall and Tom Cruise, that was 100 percent a story about Harry Hyde disagreeing with either me or my teammate, Tim Richmond. And the feud between the drivers, the one that got so bad they had to be brought in front of NASCAR to be told to chill out &ndash; that was me and Dale Earnhardt.</p>
<p>Hendrick: What &ldquo;Big John&rdquo; [played by future U.S. Senator Fred Thompson] said, &ldquo;You two monkeys,&rdquo; is what Bill France Jr. actually said to Geoff and Dale, who drove for me and Richard Childress. Richard and I were there too. After his speech, Bill Jr. said that we were all going to dinner. When Rowdy says he couldn&rsquo;t go because he had plans, that&rsquo;s exactly what Dale said too. Bill pointed to the phone and said, &ldquo;Cancel them.&rdquo; The deal on the beach, where Cole and Rowdy wrecked each other driving rental cars to that dinner, that didn&rsquo;t happen, but the rest of it sure did, including the part where Bill Jr. told me if I didn&rsquo;t get my s&mdash; together I could go back to selling cars in downtown Charlotte.</p>
<p>Darrell Waltrip, Hendrick Motorsports driver during &ldquo;Days&rdquo; production: The whole thing about the driver not really knowing anything about cars, just going out there and driving, that was exactly Tim Richmond. The tire test where Harry teaches Cole Trickle how to go faster by saving his tires, that was Harry Hyde and Tim at a real tire test at North Wilkesboro. I do like that line, &ldquo;You see Darrell Waltrip out there using up his tires?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bodine: When Duvall starts screaming at Cruise, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t work with this son of a bitch!&rdquo; that was Harry Hyde screaming at me during a meeting with Rick to try and get us to work together better.</p>
<p>Hendrick: The line from that scene that everyone loves so much, when the team owner yells, &ldquo;We look like a monkey f&mdash;ing a football out there.&rdquo; I said that to Harry and Geoff in that same meeting.</p>
<p>Iconic schemes from an iconic movie.</p>

<p>Punch: When Harry says to Cole, &ldquo;I want you to go out and hit the pace car &hellip; because you hit everything else out there and I want you to be perfect,&rdquo; that was Harry Hyde and Buddy Baker at Martinsville. The scene when Cole wants to pit but Harry says he can&rsquo;t because the crew is eating ice cream? Harry Hyde did that to Benny Parsons at Pocono.</p>
<p>Bodine: When the movie came out, all I could think was, &ldquo;Well, hell, there&rsquo;s all the stories we told Cruise and Paul Newman that night at dinner four years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By ornery, you mean &hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean real ornery!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Towne was on-site for nearly the entire shoot, as were Simpson and Bruckheimer. Every script change meant another reshoot, and every reshoot meant another day added to the schedule. Production was supposed to have wrapped up at the end of February 1990, shortly after the Daytona 500. But that date was pushed back to mid-March, then mid-April, and finally to mid-May, only six weeks before the film&rsquo;s scheduled opening. Meanwhile, the Hollywood trade papers were reporting that the film&rsquo;s budget had ballooned from $35 million to more than $60 million and Paramount was getting nervous about hitting screens in time for the coveted Fourth of July holiday.</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: There wasn&rsquo;t much sleep happening, I can tell you that. We had multiple shoots, multiple edits and multiple sound studios all running around the clock in Daytona, Charlotte and back in California. We even had Hans Zimmer with us, scoring the film live on site.</p>
<p>Hans Zimmer, Oscar-winning composer: Tony Scott asked me to come down to Daytona to meet with Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. I went down there for a meeting, so I had no clothes packed. I just had on a T-shirt. They basically started the meeting by saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so behind schedule that you can&rsquo;t leave, so we&rsquo;ll build you a studio.&rdquo; They built a gorgeous studio for me in a warehouse in Daytona. My one-day trip turned into three months, and all I had was the one T-shirt.</p>
<p>While Bruckheimer, Zimmer and Towne weren&rsquo;t sleeping because of work, everyone else on the crew wasn&rsquo;t sleeping because they were partying, led by Simpson. Both Simpson and Bruckheimer had a custom gym built at their Daytona Beach hotel. That attracted a lot of attention from the thousands of spring breakers trying to catch a glimpse of Cruise. Instead, they often walked away with invitations to one of Simpson&rsquo;s notorious parties.</p>
<p>Padelford: We had wrap parties held inside of wrap parties. I remember one night Simpson rented out an entire strip club, and when you got there he&rsquo;d instructed the special effects guys to make the parking lot look like there had been a big NASCAR crash right there at the club. They blew up a car on the spot, and it sat there, on fire.</p>
<p>Hendrick: They rented out an entire floor of the Hilton here in Charlotte and cut holes in the walls of all the rooms so that they could walk from one end of the hallway to the other without having to use a door.</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: I don&rsquo;t remember a lot of that, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a reason for that. [Laughs] We had this great confluence of great people, between the crew and the actors and so many great NASCAR people, so we had a good time. The NASCAR people had no problem holding their own.</p>
<p>John C. Reilly, aka Buck Bretherton: It was, I think, my fourth movie ever, and the first three certainly hadn&rsquo;t been like this one. I was like, &ldquo;Oh, OK, this is how this blockbuster thing works!&rdquo; And then over the next several years I was fortunate to have a lot of work and I realized, &ldquo;Oh, OK, so every shoot doesn&rsquo;t try to burn down entire hotels. Good to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m more afraid of being nothing than I am of being hurt&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; opened June 27, 1990, on a then-unthinkable 2,307 screens. But before that came a premiere in Charlotte, shown to an eager yet nervous NASCAR community. The audience gasped in awe at the opening sequence, as Zimmer&rsquo;s soaring keyboards met Jeff Beck&rsquo;s smooth guitar riffs. They got chills as they watched their machines take the green flag in the Great American Race.</p>
<p>Then came the barn.</p>
<p>Hendrick: Yeah, they cut from all of that awesome Daytona footage to this old rickety barn, and the graphic said in giant letters: CHARLOTTE, NC. A big groan went out in the theater. We had been so careful to make sure the producers had seen our race shops that are so pristine and clean, building cars using the latest technology. Charlotte was booming, a real up-and-coming city, and there it was as an old barn. I thought, &ldquo;Well, damn, here I have gone and ruined everyone&rsquo;s lives, making us look like a bunch of hillbillies racing cars. I&rsquo;m finished.&rdquo; But thankfully, it got better after that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; was even responsible for introducing Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, spawning a quintessential &rsquo;90s Hollywood romance. Paramount/Everett Collection</p>
<p>Many among the NASCAR community have still never gotten over that barn, the rickety &ldquo;race shop&rdquo; in which Harry Hogge later builds Cole Trickle&rsquo;s first Chevy Lumina, talking to it all along (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you primed, painted and weighed &hellip;&quot;). Bruckheimer, Simpson and Scott had spotted the barn during an evening drive to Hendrick&rsquo;s lake house north of Charlotte. It&rsquo;s still a roadside attraction for eagle-eyed movie fans.</p>
<p>The cringers have also never gotten past little missteps throughout the film, like showing a shot of Daytona and labeling it Rockingham, or Cole Trickle, Russ Wheeler and Rowdy Burns announcing their next moves over the radio before making them (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna draft Wheeler, make him pull me around!&quot;).</p>
<p>Wallace: I&rsquo;ve never understood NASCAR people being so sensitive about it. It was never going to be a documentary. I think it&rsquo;s fun as hell. I still do. And that&rsquo;s not because I think I owe them anything. I do still get checks every year from that one line I had in the movie, and they used to be pretty big. But I think the last one I got was for four bucks.</p>
<p>Reilly: I loved that scene of us building the car in the barn. When I was in &ldquo;Talladega Nights&rdquo; 15 years later, I tried to get them to let me shoot that same scene, where I was talking and rubbing, then getting way too intimate with the car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna buff you out and pump you full of octane, baby.&rdquo; We didn&rsquo;t shoot it. That was probably for the best.</p>
<p>Connelly: Whenever I see that scene, I imagine that&rsquo;s Robert Towne working on his script. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna shave a half inch off you and shape you like a bullet. You&rsquo;re gonna be perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; opened with a $15.4 million weekend, the equivalent of $30 million in 2020 dollars, holding off &ldquo;Dick Tracy,&rdquo; &ldquo;RoboCop 2,&rdquo; &ldquo;Total Recall&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&rdquo; for the top spot at the box office. The final tally by summer&rsquo;s end was $83 million domestic and $75 million overseas, a $310 million total when adjusted for inflation. Still, the take was less than half that of &ldquo;Top Gun.&rdquo; The comparisons between the films had been so constant, the &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; crew had worn joke &ldquo;Top Car&rdquo; caps during production. So the cash comparison was inevitable.</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: Not every movie is going to make a billion dollars. But this was a great success for everybody. We poured every ounce of energy we had into that film, and even among what has become a very fortunate filmography, &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; remains very special to me. It&rsquo;s because of the people who worked on it. Tony, Don, they are special people in my life and always will be.</p>
<p>The weeks leading up to its release was peppered with &ldquo;Days of Plunder&rdquo; stories, detailing the swollen production budget and schedule, describing shouting matches between Towne and Simpson, especially when Simpson&rsquo;s Mario Andretti-ish character, Aldo Benedetti, was trimmed down to a one-line cameo. The Hollywood press blamed the film for breaking the &ldquo;visionary alliance&rdquo; open-checkbook business model before the first movie produced within that system had even been released. (Bruckheimer, Simpson and Paramount mutually ended their agreement later that year.) It was the supposed end of Hollywood hedonism as we knew it.</p>
<p>Connelly: That&rsquo;s not really a fair framing of the &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; story, is it? I seem to remember plenty of Arnold movies and Sly Stallone movies and Joel Silver productions after 1990. The real story of that film are the ghosts associated with it. That set is where Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman met and fell in love. I believe their big reveal as a couple was at the Oscars while &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; was still in production. Later, of course, it became one of the biggest divorce stories Hollywood has seen in quite some time. Don Simpson&rsquo;s very bright flame burned out with his [drug overdose] death in 1996. And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever know the real story behind Tony Scott&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Scott died on Aug. 19, 2012, when he jumped from a bridge in San Pedro, California. He left behind 12-year-old twin boys and a wife, Donna Wilson Scott. He met her on the &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; set when she played the girlfriend of Reilly&rsquo;s Buck Bretherton, and they married in 1994.</p>
<p>Tony Scott, in a 2010 interview: &ldquo;Days of Thunder,&rdquo; it was hard to make. But it was also so fun. And it gave me the greatest gift of my life: my family.</p>
<p>Those ghosts aren&rsquo;t limited to the Hollywood side of the story. Rick Hendrick says he still loves to catch the film on TV because it reminds him of Harry Hyde, who died in 1996, and Tim Richmond, the driver upon whom Cole Trickle was loosely based. Richmond died from complications of HIV/AIDS on Aug. 13, 1989, the same day that Cruise and Towne were at Watkins Glen doing their story research.</p>
<p>Hendrick: Racers love nothing more than to sit around telling stories about old friends. These stories and the people in them, they are going to live forever thanks to this film.</p>
<p>Cruise: I think the real filmmaking legacy of that movie is what it did for the way that NASCAR, and really auto racing in general, is portrayed. The look of that movie changed everything.</p>
<p>Padelford: The fingerprints of &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; are all over any racing movie you&rsquo;ve seen since. My same camera car was used for &ldquo;Talladega Nights.&rdquo; The camera rig from that car was used for &ldquo;Ford v Ferrari&rdquo; just two years ago. I work on all of the Fast &amp; Furious films, Marvel films, &ldquo;Baby Driver,&rdquo; you name it, and what we built for &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; is used for almost every one of those movies. I just worked on a film with John C. Reilly before the quarantine, and we spent hours shooting him driving around Los Angeles. As soon as I mentioned &ldquo;Days,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s what we talked about and laughed about, all night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remember me?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the years have passed, those from the NASCAR world who were involved in &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; and those who were so offended by its lack of authenticity in 1990 have largely moved on from the sport. Meanwhile, the film has been a lot like Cole Trickle&rsquo;s Lumina at Darlington, mysteriously gaining speed while other financially larger films of its era have fallen off the pace. When&rsquo;s the last time you saw &ldquo;Dick Tracy&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Connelly: It has maintained legs, and I think that nostalgia certainly has a lot to do with that. You miss seeing Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty racing at North Wilkesboro? Well, there they are. Like old friends, even if there are some images and moments that are certainly dated now.</p>
<p>See: The three Confederate flag shots in that legendary opening sequence. Earlier this month NASCAR banned that flag from its racetracks. But their inclusion in the film at the time is a very accurate time capsule of the 1990 Daytona 500 experience. Also, that Sweet&rsquo;N Low drafting lesson? That was born from an actual explanation of how the slingshot move worked, shown to Cruise and Towne by racers on a restaurant table, then transferred to Nicole Kidman&rsquo;s thigh for the film, explained by Trickle amid twisted sheets after a lovemaking session, because Cole, he was romantic like that. Trickle&rsquo;s moves might have worked on Dr. Lewicki, but the slingshot move hasn&rsquo;t worked that way since the year before the film was shot. NASCAR introduced horsepower-leveling restrictor plates at superspeedway races in 1988.</p>
<p>Petty: I seem to remember people getting a little squirmy about that scene back then. But hey, the way he explained it wasn&rsquo;t wrong, either. I lost races and won races on slingshot deals just like that. [Laughs]</p>
<p>Those in the motorsports community who rolled their eyes at the film back in the day been replaced by a generation of racers who saw it in the theater as kids and have had it on repeat in the 30 years since. They love it. So do NASCAR fans, who have made it a go-to midsummer ratings-getter for cable TV. Paramount Pictures recently decided to include it in a limited series of &ldquo;Paramount Presents&rdquo; remastered Blu-ray releases, placed alongside Elvis Presley&rsquo;s &ldquo;King Creole,&rdquo; Glenn Close&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fatal Attraction&rdquo; and Cary Grant&rsquo;s &ldquo;To Catch A Thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie Johnson, seven-time Cup Series champion: I was 15 when the movie came out. I watched it several times, but what I really did was play the &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; video game nonstop. It was hard as hell, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>While Robert Duvall, left, and Cruise were at the heights of their acting careers, John C. Reilly, center, was just getting his big break. Paramount/Everett Collection</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s racers gleefully quote Towne&rsquo;s script over the radio during races, and when it comes time for Darlington Raceway&rsquo;s annual throwback weekends, they paint their cars to look like Cole&rsquo;s, Rowdy&rsquo;s and even Russ Wheeler&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Kyle Busch, reigning NASCAR Cup Series champion: It is no exaggeration to say that between the ages of 6 and 10 I probably watched that movie 200 times. I would come home from school, make a snack and watch it with my grandmother. VHS, baby!</p>
<p>When Busch first broke into NASCAR via the Truck series, his team owner, Billy Ballew, fielded a black machine with a white &ldquo;15&rdquo; on the door. Busch asked him to flip those digits, meaning he would drive a black No. 51 Chevy, just like Rowdy Burns. Instead of his name over the driver&rsquo;s side window, Busch went with &ldquo;Rowdy,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s been his nickname ever since. In 2015, he even shot a series of commercials for sponsor M&amp;M&rsquo;s where he reenacted &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; scenes with crew chief Adam Stevens as Harry Hogge and boss Joe Gibbs as Tim Daland.</p>
<p>Busch: Whatever if the movie isn&rsquo;t perfectly accurate. It makes racing look cool. And if you go back and look at the growth boom of NASCAR in the 1990s, you know what kick-started that? Damn &ldquo;Days of Thunder&rdquo; did, man! The only question now is: Are they going to make another one? And what would the story be?</p>
<p>Rooker: When we left ol' Rowdy, he had brain damage, so unfortunately I think he&rsquo;s done as a driver. Maybe he&rsquo;s a team owner now, like Dale Earnhardt was. If nothing else, Rowdy and Cole could race wheelchairs again. This time we&rsquo;ll do it in a retirement home. And I&rsquo;ll beat Tom&rsquo;s little ass again, like I did in 1990. Hell yeah, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Hendrick: I need to check and see if I have enough cars to pull that off again. What&rsquo;s Jerry say?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask the man, shall we? As Jerry Bruckheimer is on the phone from California, he is post-producing virus-delayed &ldquo;Top Gun: Maverick&rdquo; remotely, while cranking up preproduction on &ldquo;Beverly Hills Cop 4&rdquo; and &ldquo;National Treasure 3.&rdquo; Last year his &ldquo;Bad Boys for Life&rdquo; was a smash hit. Classic sequels are working.</p>
<p>So &hellip; &ldquo;Days of Thunder 2&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: I would love to do it. But you need to have the right people in place. You can&rsquo;t do it without Tom, and he&rsquo;s tied up for the next three or four years. He has a couple of &ldquo;Mission Impossible&rdquo; projects in the works, and he&rsquo;s also trying to get up to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Bruckheimer: [Laughs] I told you, no one takes it to the limit like Tom Cruise.

<h3 id="video-shows-karen-rapping-the-n-word-to-her-black-boss-at-the-office">&ldquo;Video shows ‘Karen’ rapping the N-word to her Black boss at the office&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DD_KarenFired-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
A viral video shows a woman rapping and yelling the N-word at a Black man at least 15 times in a workplace.</p>
<p>Reports claim the incident occurred at the office of Gibson Arnold &amp; Associates in Houston, Texas. The video was shared on different platforms, such as Twitter by the account Black With No Chaser, and has been viewed more hundreds of thousands of times.</p>
<p>Gibson Arnold &amp; Associates</p>
<p>4635 Southwest Fwy Ste 202</p>
<p>Houston TX 77027</p>
<p>(713) 572-3000</p>
<p>[email protected] — Donald Whipple Fox / Hushasha (@Hushasha40) June 30, 2020</p>
<p>According to TMZ, the incident took place on Monday after the woman was fired.</p>
<p>The over one-minute-long video starts with the woman yelling, “Think as [N-word]” at a Black man, identified as Kenton Oates, who is in a leadership position at the company. Oates is sitting on a swivel chair and remains calm throughout the video.</p>
<p>“You better call the police cause I said N-word,” she continues.</p>
<p>She then repeats the N-word at least 15 times, as Oates keeps swiveling on his chair, looking away from the woman at times.</p>
<p>“Let’s make some rap for the [N-word]” she says, trying to rap and making obscure gestures.</p>
<p>“I wanna hear you rap motherfucker,” she says while clapping her hands.</p>
<p>“You’re not a [N-word]. You’re a fake-ass [N-word],” she continues.</p>
<p>The only other person seen in the background of the video is a white man. Both men are wearing masks, but the woman does not have one on.</p>
<p>Someone in the background is heard saying, “Can we concentrate on our tasks? It’s really important that we do this.”</p>
<p>The man in the background can be seen recording the incident on his phone.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s really important that you record it, so you get some publicity,” the woman says.</p>
<p>“Nah. Don’t worry. This is all for attention. I’m not trying to post this anywhere,” says another man in the room, who is out of the camera’s view.</p>
<p>“I don’t give a damn what you do,” says the woman.</p>
<p>“I don’t give a damn what you do either,” he says.</p>
<p>She cuts in, “You need to do your eyebrows.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to do my work,” one of the men says, “and this is a misunderstanding on your part.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that you need to do your eyebrows, and it’s a misunderstanding on your part,” she responds.</p>
<p>“You can’t attack my looks,” he says.</p>
<p>“Oh my god. It’s racial,” she says in a sarcastic tone. “Oh my god. This poor guy. They really have to suffer through this—it’s injustice. These guys are so stupid that they can’t make it through life, they can’t get to the metro stop, they can’t get Uber.”</p>
<p>The video then ends.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gibson Arnold &amp; Associates released a statement identifying Oates and condemning the “horrific racist rant.”</p>
<p>Gibson Arnold &amp; Associates/Twitter</p>
<p>It did not name the woman, only saying she was on a “short term assignment” with the company. She was “immediately terminated” and escorted out of the office after her racist rant.</p>
<p>The statement also clarified that two women, full-time employee Elaina McMillan and former employee Michelle Bresser, were initially falsely “targeted” after being mistakenly identified as the woman in question.</p>

<li>‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’ (1984) – Wes Craven To this day, New Line Cinema is known as “The House That Freddy Built” as Freddy Krueger entered our nightmares and clawed his way into a long-running slasher franchise.</li>
</ol>
<p>13/30</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>‘The Haunting’ (1963) – Robert Wise Between “West Side Story” and “The Sound of Music,” Robert Wise directed this haunted-house masterpiece that scares the hell out of us without ever having to show us a damn thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>14/30</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>‘Poltergeist’ (1982) – Tobe Hooper “They’re here!” Cursed child actress Heather O’Rourke gets sucked into an alternate dimension by staring at a static TV, while a suburban family is haunted by social commentary, from the opening “National Anthem” to the climactic revelation of a Native American burial ground.</li>
</ol>
<p>15/30</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>‘The Birds’ (1963) – Alfred Hitchcock Hitchcock delivers textbook suspense as crows gather on a schoolyard jungle gym, but the film is really about Tippi Hedren’s relationship with potential mother-in-law Jessica Tandy, the story ending when that bond is healed.</li>
</ol>
<p>16/30</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>‘Let the Right One In’ (2008) – Tomas Alfredson This unique chiller took the unique approach of a child vampire’s relationship with her oft-bullied neighbor, artfully painting the white snow with red blood and building toward a shocking underwater swimming pool finale.</li>
</ol>
<p>17/30</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>‘Dracula’ (1931) – Tod Browning “Children of the night! What music they make.” It’s hard to find horror monsters more iconic than Bela Lugosi’s Count Dracula, who creeps around Bram Stoker’s castle in Transylvania in the vampire footsteps of “Nosferatu” (see our “Silent” film category).</li>
</ol>
<p>18/30</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>‘Frankenstein’ (1931-1935) – James Whale “It’s alive!” Boris Karloff turned Mary Shelley’s literary classic into an iconic monster for Universal Studios. Colin Clive’s Dr. Frankenstein memorably watched him come alive, while Elsa Lanchester enchanted in the sequel “Bride of Frankenstein.”</li>
</ol>
<p>19/30</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>‘Night of the Living Dead’ (1968) – George Romero Long before “The Walking Dead,” Romero’s groundbreaking film single-handedly invented the zombie genre with this franchise, offering such social commentary as “Dawn of the Dead” zombies resembling frenzied Black Friday shoppers.</li>
</ol>
<p>20/30</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’ (1974) – Tobe Hooper Loosely based on real-life Wisconsin killer Ed Gein, Hooper’s gritty style lent a documentary feel to Leatherface and his house of horrors, making a generation of audiences feel like they were watching a real chainsaw massacre.</li>
</ol>
<p>21/30</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>‘Halloween’ (1978) – John Carpenter Masked killer Michael Myers escapes Donald Pleasance’s insane asylum and returns to his childhood neighborhood to stalk Jamie Lee Curtis’ virginal babysitter. Director John Carpenter wrote the iconic piano theme himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>22/30</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>‘Scream’ (1996) – Wes Craven “Do you like scary movies?” Drew Barrymore’s opening slaughter by the Ghost-Faced Killer was downright shocking, while Wes Craven’s satire script taught us the rules of horror: (1) Never have sex, (2) Never drink or do drugs, and (3) Never say, “I’ll be right back.”</li>
</ol>
<p>23/30</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>‘The Omen’ (1976) – Richard Donner Few film moments are scarier than seeing Gregory Peck trimming the hair of his adopted son Damien, looking for the Anti-Christ’s “666” as his demonic nanny slept in the adjacent room, all backed by Jerry Goldsmith’s Oscar-winning choir of “Ave Satani.”</li>
</ol>
<p>24/30</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>‘Carrie’ (1976) – Brian De Palma Stephen King’s first book-to-film adaptation delivered a fiery Sissy Spacek and religious Piper Laurie. Brian DePalma directs a slow-mo steamy opening in the locker room, an impressive Figure-8 shot at prom, and a final grave scene shot in reverse for an eerie effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>25/30</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>‘Get Out’ (2017) – Jordan Peele Jordan Peele’s Oscar-winning masterpiece of slow-burn suspense was a chilling social commentary packed with dialogue full of double meanings and symbolic images, from deer antlers to American flag costumes to cotton-picking escapes.</li>
</ol>
<p>26/30</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>‘Jaws’ (1975) – Steven Spielberg While it becomes a “Moby Dick” adventure in the second half, the first hour rivals the scariest stuff ever put on screen with underwater P.O.V. shots set to John Williams’ iconic two-note score.</li>
</ol>
<p>27/30</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>‘The Shining’ (1980) – Stanley Kubrick Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel is utterly claustrophobic, as Jack Nicholson discovers the horror of Room 327, Danny encounters twin girl ghosts on his tricycle and Shelley Duvall flees an ax-wielding maniac screaming, “Here’s Johnny!”</li>
</ol>
<p>28/30</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>‘The Exorcist’ (1973) – William Friedkin Deemed by many the scariest movie of all time, “The Exorcist” mines slow-burn suspense from the mystery of faith, then jolts us repeatedly with the most grotesquely shocking, head-spinning jump scares ever put on screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>29/30</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>‘Rosemary’s Baby’ (1968) – Roman Polanski “The Exorcist” and “The Omen” would not exist without this haunting tale of newlyweds Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes moving into the Dakota Building, where the Oscar-winning Ruth Gordon appears in the peephole, plunging Rosemary into a trippy hallucination, a mystery of cult conspiracy and a shocking reveal of biblical proportions.</li>
</ol>
<p>30/30</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Psycho’ (1960) – Alfred Hitchcock Hitchcock single-handedly invented the slasher genre. Audiences screamed so loud at Janet Leigh’s shower demise that they couldn’t hear Bernard Herrmann’s famous theme, leaving dutiful mama’s boy Norman Bates to pick up the shocking pieces.
