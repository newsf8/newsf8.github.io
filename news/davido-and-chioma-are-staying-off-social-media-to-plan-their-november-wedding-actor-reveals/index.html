<p>In the good old days of Vine, one of the most popular clips was that of what appears to be a kid holding up a machete. With a mix of tears and sweat falling from his face, the young man cries to his mother, whom we can‚Äôt see in the video. You can feel the pain in his voice when he says, ‚ÄúMama, tell him!‚Äù In a sudden burst of exasperation, he throws down the machete and sits with his bowed head in his hands, defeatedly hissing, ‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù This video quickly became the go-to reaction meme for expressing frustration, annoyance, or disappointment. The looping effect of Vines made it impossible to stop watching it, but the origin of the clip was largely a mystery.</p>
<p>THIS VINE OF AN AFRICAN KID CRYING WITH A MACHETE WILL NEVER GET OLD HAAHAHHA pic.twitter.com/jO5DaBhUOY ‚Äî Huda (@NikeAllah) January 13, 2017</p>
<p>Fast-forward to a post-Vine 2019, a world where short videos of two small boys doing decidedly grown-up things like smoking cigars, pranking adults, and successfully wooing a number of women with their boisterous, high-pitched voices began to pick up in popularity on Twitter. Like the Vine that preceded them, the origin of these videos has remained obscure.</p>
<p>But for those well versed in movies from the Nigerian film industry, a.k.a. Nollywood, there‚Äôs no mystery here. The ‚Äúboys‚Äù in these viral videos are the Nigerian comic-film duo Osita Iheme and Chinedu Ikedieze. Ikedieze is also the crying guy from the Vine. Don‚Äôt be fooled by Iheme and Ikedieze‚Äôs size ‚Äî they‚Äôre both grown men (Iheme is 37 and Ikedieze is 41). They‚Äôre two of the most sought-after actors in Nigeria for comedic roles, and they rose to fame by playing mischievous children under the moniker ‚ÄúAki and Pawpaw.‚Äù</p>
<p>Nicole, a Brazil-based woman behind the Twitter account @nollywoodroll, is largely responsible for Iheme and Ikedieze‚Äôs meme-star status. Her account, which has amassed over 200,000 followers since January, was created after she discovered the actors from Ikedieze‚Äôs famous Vine. Out of curiosity, she combed the internet for more videos of the actor and slowly worked her way through his entire filmography, as well as Iheme‚Äôs. She loved the movies so much that she decided to create an account to post snippets from them, as a form of homage to the actors. ‚ÄúI had no idea how far the clips would go!‚Äù she tells Vulture. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite exciting that a lot of people enjoy this content and thank me for introducing them to these actors.‚Äù</p>
<p>Iheme and Ikedieze have a vast selection of movies where they act as brothers or exuberant buddies. Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the more popular ones that have been immortalized thanks to Twitter:</p>
<p>Me when I&rsquo;m asking my classmate for answer to a question in the exam hall and my invigilator spots me pic.twitter.com/J7yC1d2Ukw ‚Äî Chika Nelson‚Ñ¢ (@chikanels) May 23, 2019</p>
<p>One of the most popular memes is this scene from the 2007 movie Stubborn Flies. It‚Äôs a comedy about a spoiled young man (played by Iheme) who wants to move out of his parents‚Äô home, take some responsibility for himself, and start a family. Ikedieze plays the role of his ‚Äúguardian angel,‚Äù dressed in a white tux, who constantly visits him and tries to make him act right. Iheme‚Äôs character remains mostly unimpressed by his angel (‚ÄúWhere are your wings?‚Äù he asks suspiciously), but eventually he forms a friendship with him. In this particular scene ‚Äî which has now been viewed by millions of Twitter users ‚Äî Iheme is sitting in a chair with a book in his hand, trying to make sense of everything going on around him. The look on his face shows that something isn‚Äôt going right, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why.</p>
<p>The 2004 comedy Mr. Ibu features this scene of Iheme‚Äôs character, Muo, stealing a few gulps from his father‚Äôs beer bottle and running off before he gets caught. In the movie, he plays a mischievous young boy who navigates the somewhat turbulent relationship he has with his father by pulling roguish pranks that he mostly gets away with thanks to his father‚Äôs vapidness.</p>
<p>This film is one of many in which the actors played teenagers, which they‚Äôre able to pull off as a result of their small stature and youthful look. Iheme and Ikedieze are undeterred by their size. If anything, it‚Äôs perfect for their movie roles, giving them an edge against bullies who may underestimate or try to outsmart them. Mr. Ibu is one of the most popular comedy films from Nigeria, a two-hour joyride marked by Iheme‚Äôs effortless humor.</p>

<p>This clip from the 2008 movie Marcus D Millionaire is one of the few scenes where both actors are absolutely quiet ‚Äî a rare occurrence for the quick-witted and smart-mouthed pair. In the movie, the two men become wealthy by some stroke of luck and then the target of envious neighbors. The plot is pretty improbable (the pair are offered an unlimited amount of money by a king to start a business and quit causing trouble within the community), but it‚Äôs hilarious nonetheless. This clip may be pure silence, but for the majority of the film, Iheme and Ikedieze constantly throw out one sarcastic remark after another, and it‚Äôs beautiful to watch.</p>

<p>This meme ‚Äî which was originally posted by Nicole ‚Äî has been viewed over 20 million times on Twitter. It shows Iheme looking on in puzzlement while two men appear to play a game. It‚Äôs arguably become the best way to communicate confusion on Twitter these days, as evidenced by the many variations of captions that have accompanied the video.</p>
<p>The source of this clip is the 2007 movie Chicken Republic. Starring Iheme and two other Nigerian comic actors, Francis Odega and Victor Osuagwu, the two-part film explores three men‚Äôs humorous experiences on their quest to get rich. When their chicken-farm business starts to crumble thanks to the scourge of bird flu, the men turn to other dubious means of earning money, with unintended consequences. Their antics continue in the sequel, titled Bird Flu. I mean, why not?</p>

<p>Calculating huge mathematical figures is a hobby for these two in the 2008 movie Intelligent Students. Not only do we have the money-counting memes as a result of this film, it‚Äôs also the source of the legendary Vine. The movie stars Ikedieze and Iheme as two brothers, Pere and Santo, who try to help out with their family‚Äôs dire financial situation by doing odd jobs while coping with their father, who has a drinking problem. Somehow, they manage to turn an otherwise dark story line into comedy gold.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve only just discovered these actors and you‚Äôre eager to find out more, a YouTube search of any of these movie titles is a great place to start. Each one is just as funny as the next, and the hilarity of these movies can be easily appreciated, even by people who do not have a firm grasp of the plot or subject matter. (Here‚Äôs a tip before you start: Clear your schedule for the day, because most of these films are pretty lengthy.) The duo, for what it‚Äôs worth, seem pleasantly surprised by their meme fame. ‚ÄúWhenever I go live on Instagram, people tune in from all over the world,‚Äù Ikedieze said in an interview last year. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt figure out who introduced them to my movies, but I am grateful for it.‚Äù

<h3 id="comedians-in-covid-getting-candid">&ldquo;Comedians in COVID Getting Candid&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2020/06/12/RacquelBelmonte.jpg" alt="img">
COVID-19 has caused profound shifts to many vocations ‚Äî for example, it‚Äôs stripped comedians of their live audiences and laughter, which is the only way to know if something is funny. Since comedy does not often pay the bills for emerging Canadian comedians, what‚Äôs the incentive to stay focused on jokes?</p>
<p>We spoke with six Vancouver-based performers to understand how they‚Äôre adapting without laughs and what they‚Äôre learning through these new constraints. Our interviews were edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>Ese Atawo is a Nigerian Canadian actor and comedian. She‚Äôs a member of improv troupes such as Your Moms and Nasty Women, a faculty member and diversity co-ordinator for Blind Tiger Comedy school and involved in theatrical events and festivals in Vancouver and abroad.</p>
<p>What is the role of comedians during a pandemic?</p>
<p>Comedy is supposed to give joy and light. We are all already so isolated with our jobs and the rat race. During this time, we are even more isolated. Good comedy is mundane, but it‚Äôs also so true and simple. The simple things are always the hardest and the funniest.</p>
<p>I try and find things that I find funny, then I find ways to testify, to argue on behalf of the idea and really make it funny. I try to get the best ingredients for the cake ‚Äî good sugar, good eggs, good flour and try hard to get all the ingredients right ‚Äî and if it doesn‚Äôt turn out, I won‚Äôt cook it again.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs the hardest aspect of the pandemic for you?</p>
<p>Having time is the hardest. Having time to reflect. I don‚Äôt know how to respect time. I have to figure that out. Time is forgiving ‚Äî respect it ‚Äî but don‚Äôt let it go by. Time is a bitch ‚Äî but don‚Äôt leave me! The mirror is closer than ever, and it‚Äôs harder to ignore. It‚Äôs just me and the mirror.</p>
<p>Do you miss performing?</p>
<p>I so much miss performing. We do daily performances at my house with my two roommates, but I really miss people laughing at my dumb jokes. Audiences give me energy. I miss the taste, the feel, everything about it.</p>
<p>Pro tip for surviving a pandemic?</p>
<p>I suggest connecting with people. Actively seek out friends, Zoom, call people, reach out and take lots of walks. Journaling is good too. Listen to music and dance like everyone is watching you. Dance like you are staring at your crush. Lately I‚Äôve been finding it hard to commit, plan, write or imagine. Hey, it‚Äôs my first pandemic! It‚Äôs been heavy and hard, the creative process. But slowly, it‚Äôs coming. I always have to question if my writing is good enough. I sabotage myself with my censor voice. I think that I do better with less time. I have been reaching out to help strangers and connecting with students to see how they are doing ‚Äî being an ear and creating space.</p>
<p>Amber Harper-Young was a finalist in B.C.‚Äôs Funniest Female 2014. In 2015, she co-created and performed in a live series of Tragedy Comedy Shows at Yuk Yuk‚Äôs. She also co-hosts Vancouverite, a monthly show. We interviewed her at the end of her shift at Downtown Eastside Women‚Äôs Centre where she‚Äôs worked for the past three years.</p>
<p>What is the role of comedians during a pandemic?</p>
<p>I can make people laugh. I can add levity to people‚Äôs lives.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs been the hardest aspect of the pandemic for you?</p>
<p>No live comedy. It‚Äôs what I live for. Every show, every set is different. The weird laugher in the back of the audience. Comedy is another language, and not like anything else in life. Before COVID, I felt like I was getting to my essence on stage, there was an exciting momentum. Then we got cut off. I wondered how I was going to live, to express myself? The high from performing is a byproduct of people relating to me when I am communicating great things about them. That is funny. Getting crowds wound up, seeing and hearing people. I love when the audience is funny.</p>
<p>But my day job is valuable. I have to stay well-rested and to focus on that. There is not a lot of room for writing.</p>
<p>Tips for surviving a pandemic?</p>
<p>Surrender. Accept what is going on. Do the best you can. I have only had one full meltdown. We are fools if we don‚Äôt make the corrections on things that we have been exposed to us during this time. I have gone deeper into service work. Comics are flakes and jokers. I am here to do real work.</p>
<p>What have we learned about ourselves during this time?</p>
<p>We overload ourselves to the point of not being aware. We now have time to process how we lived in the past. I want to be a different person, changing the pace of my life ‚Äî shift priorities, with more time for friends and strangers ‚Äî these things have the highest value. I have learned a lot. Nature is saying to us: ‚ÄúHold on a sec, wash up, cleanse this air and water.‚Äù Right now, the air is fresher; we can see details on the mountains.</p>
<p>Do you miss performing?</p>
<p>I am going to cry, I miss it so much. Please don‚Äôt mention it again. Ha!</p>
<p>I have to embrace my on-stage failure. I used to be paralyzed by stage fright, but now, after 10 years, the audience is more accepting that I am human. They want to see me mess up ‚Äî but with a smile. Then, they can judge themselves less. I deal with my issues through comedy. It‚Äôs not well articulated and I am never sure what is funny. There is a lot of failure. I can work on something for three years. I don‚Äôt write quickly.</p>
<p>If you are not nervous, then you are bored, and you might as well not do comedy. I have to integrate growth into every set. Then reassess. I am constantly challenging myself to do better work. It‚Äôs my existential crisis. I have to keep changing who I am. And constantly be in the moment. Now that I am talking about performing, I am missing it more. It‚Äôs so intimate. I can‚Äôt over-analyze the creativity. I have to just see the beauty. The more I perform from the heart, the more genuine I become and the easier it is to communicate.</p>
<p>Racquel Belmonte is a voice actor, sketch comedian, improviser and writer living in Vancouver. When she‚Äôs not performing in her comedy duo Carmelahhh, she is performing with her all-female comedy troupe Nasty Women. She also works as a residential youth worker in a five-bed shelter in Vancouver.</p>
<p>What is the role of the comedian during this pandemic?</p>
<p>I see my role as comedian to make this crisis easier for other people to get through. I can use YouTube or other social media to make people laugh. Laughter is a beautiful release. We have had enough tears. Laughter doesn‚Äôt fix anything but it‚Äôs nice. My friends are all comedians. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without that community. I think of comedy like the Good Samaritan Act ‚Äî you cannot pass by an opportunity to brighten someone‚Äôs day.</p>
<p>The Nasty Women comedy troupe has been using our audience to donate to good causes, like where I work. It‚Äôs great seeing my two worlds collide.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs been the hardest aspect of the pandemic for you?</p>
<p>I was supposed to leave for Toronto on April 26 to further my career in improv and sketch comedy. But I was living with my parents while waiting to go, and now I am back in my old childhood room stuck here for months. With my two brothers and my mom and dad. At first there was a ton of uncertainty and fear. I had no control over my feeling. And my therapist is away on maternity leave.</p>
<p>Tips for surviving a pandemic?</p>
<p>Going to London Drugs and stocking up on beauty products. I dyed my hair but then burned my scalp. It took a month to recover from that. I can‚Äôt control much, so I am trying to control my appearances. Foam roller was the last thing that I bought. My hair never looks like this. Just ask my mom.</p>
<p>Edibles are getting me through this. I just couldn‚Äôt shut off my brain. They salvaged my mental health and allowed me to sleep and relax. Being with my family has been helpful, crazy and amazing.</p>
<p>Do you miss performing?</p>
<p>I feel like I don‚Äôt even know how to perform anymore. Improv is scaring me. I don‚Äôt normally get nervous, but I have completely stopped writing comedy, except notes on my phone and texting.</p>
<p>What have you learned from the pandemic?</p>
<p>I‚Äôve learned that I need to be around people. I am independent but always choose to talk or have physical contact with my comedian friends. I miss sitting in a huge auditorium after a show and chatting. I miss all the bodies and laughing together. I love that we would all come together for the same reason ‚Äî to laugh.</p>
<p>I have become a Zoom queen. I am a voice actor. But it‚Äôs busy at home, so that can be challenging with five people in a busy house, especially with two younger brothers.</p>
<p>During this time, I‚Äôve been more observant as a comedian, taking more time to flesh out ideas and see how far I can take an idea.</p>
<p>Morgan Brayton is a writer and performer who lives in Vancouver with her wife and an excessive number of cats. A Canadian Comedy Award nominee, she‚Äôs one quarter of The Lady Show, winners of best variety show at the Vancouver Comedy Awards and pick of the Fringe at the Vancouver Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>Pro tips for surviving a pandemic?</p>
<p>Kaftans have been my key to surviving the pandemic. I have three of them now. My neighbours call me Maude from the ‚Äô70s TV show. I haven‚Äôt worn makeup for months. I am wearing the total ‚Äô70s feminist uniform. There is such freedom in not wearing a bra.</p>
<p>Being in service to others makes me feel better. I have been sewing masks. So far, I have sewn over 200. If people want a mask, then they have to donate to one of four organizations that are helping people during COVID (the United Way, Battered Women‚Äôs Support Services, Vancouver Orphan Kitten Rescue Association and the food bank). When people come to pick up their masks on our front porch, they have to dance. We have installed a video camera and we get to watch. We are creating our own entertainment.</p>
<p>I have also been shopping for friends. Folks that are immune compromised or just can‚Äôt get out. And I have been organizing Dumpling Day. There‚Äôs a 50/50 chance that Hey, Dumplings! restaurant is going to go under. So we created Dumpling Day, and a whole bunch of artists donated their time and quirky prizes. I find all this gratifying.</p>
<p>What is the role of comedians during the pandemic?</p>
<p>I have no huge urge to make comedy right now. I see that lots of comics are freaking out. Comedy for the sake of comedy is not interesting to me. I‚Äôm living this thing, which makes it very interesting ‚Äî and funny ‚Äî to me. I don‚Äôt think that output is always necessary.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs been the hardest aspect of the pandemic for you?</p>
<p>When I taught comedy, I used to say to my students if you find it funny, then others will also find it funny. Last week, I finally shaved one leg. I just didn‚Äôt get around to the other leg for another week. I thought it was hilarious. So did other people I shared it with on social media.</p>
<p>I am not a disciplined person. I wish that I was. I don‚Äôt have a process, it‚Äôs all instinct.</p>
<p>I just wrote a pilot for a TV series. The virtual stuff just takes a different kind of energy. I am happy to stay at home with the cats and write. Just because you can catch up on everything on TV doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to. I have almost caught up on the entire Murdoch Mysteries series, which is really very good.</p>
<p>Do you miss performing?</p>
<p>Yes, I miss performing. There are seasons and a time for everything. You can‚Äôt output all the time. Sometimes I need to not perform. I have other things in my life. I can now trust that if I don‚Äôt feel like performing, it‚Äôs OK. If I never perform again, it wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world. But it will be fine when the time comes. I have a solid relationship and I have cats.</p>
<p>The day before the show I am a wreck. I am anxious, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt drink. I drive my partner crazy. And this is after years of performing. But once I am a couple of minutes into the show and I get the first laugh ‚Äî no wine, no drug, no cat is as good as that feeling. Making an audience laugh ‚Äî that‚Äôs why we keep doing it.</p>
<p>Comedy is a unifying act, it‚Äôs a human shared experience. There is a power in making people laugh, especially in a theatre. It‚Äôs a shared experience.</p>
<p>There is no point in making comedy unless it has a strong, underlying message of social change ‚Äî unless it makes people laugh. Then it‚Äôs OK.</p>
<p>Nathan Hare and Nima Gholamipour live together in a Commercial Drive apartment that‚Äôs housed up-and-coming comedians for years. Hare performs around Vancouver and co-hosts the show Soda Fountain at Little Mountain Gallery. Gholamipour is an Iranian Canadian who‚Äôs done comedy and made all sorts of art in the city for almost a decade.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs the role of comedians during a pandemic?</p>
<p>Hare: We have to provide levity so that people don‚Äôt feel alone.</p>
<p>Gholamipour: We can all relate to this situation, to the daily struggles. Making fun of basic shit, like cooking, when I don‚Äôt know how to cook. It‚Äôs funny because we are all in it. Most of us comedians have mental health issues. It‚Äôs a side of us that we don‚Äôt talk about. We need the support of our community. We are so separate. The loneliness is hard. We are missing our community.</p>
<p>Pro tip for surviving this pandemic?</p>
<p>Gholamipour: Get off the phone. My phone time has spiked.</p>
<p>Hare: Get outside. Get off the phone. Engage in healthy news. And don‚Äôt put pressure on yourself to be productive. We don‚Äôt all need to create a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Gholamipour: I am waking up to new lessons every day. A lot of people have learned new lessons. And keep the sparkling water coming. Have some non-alcoholic beverages around. Cook stuff that you like to eat. We started having pizza Friday where we would make pizza from scratch. Then we analyze every aspect of the pizza. Is this crust too thick?</p>
<p>Do you miss performing?</p>
<p>Gholamipour: Yes and no. I don‚Äôt miss the expectation to be funny. When you say, ‚Äúyes‚Äù to a show, you put this pressure on yourself. It‚Äôs nice to just relax and have funny thoughts. Comedy stresses me out.</p>
<p>Hare: I don‚Äôt miss the exhaustion. People love you when you are funny. People love politicians when they are funny. Comedy is an amazing tool.</p>
<p>Gholamipour: There are other things that are important right now, which may influence my work later.</p>
<p>Hare: When I‚Äôm performing, I‚Äôm eating out a lot and drinking a lot. It‚Äôs great to be at home cooking. But I do miss performing. I am enjoying a Comedy Vacation. The stress before shows is pretty great. I think that artists get a pass to be nervous. Everyone has their own way of dealing with this. We think that if you‚Äôre not nervous before a show, then it‚Äôs not that important.</p>
<p>Gholamipour: You have to find your own clown, your own style. Improv, sketch and standup all have their own different vibe. With improv, it can be euphoric. It can be so magical. At times, I don‚Äôt even remember what went on. I‚Äôve had people tell me that they loved some bit that I did, and honestly, I‚Äôve done so many shows now they all bleed into one big memory.</p>
<p>Hare: When we started out, every show was huge. It‚Äôs absurd to think about it now. After a bad show, I would say to myself: ‚ÄúI have to rethink my life. I gotta make some changes. Maybe I should become an electrician. Dad was right.‚Äù</p>
<p>How was the pandemic affected you?</p>
<p>Gholamipour: Being a single dude, it‚Äôs not been great. And I had to stay away from my family. With the new rules, I have just started seeing them. It‚Äôs really nice to see family.</p>
<p>Hare: I still only go out when necessary. I still think twice about everything. The handshake is gone. Totally gone.</p>
<p>Gholamipour: My breakthrough is that it‚Äôs nice to have time to create without forcing things. But then sometimes it gets cringy and less spontaneous when you have too much time. Sometimes we just make up shit and do little videos for ourselves that we find funny. We are up-and-coming performers. We are learning to have a voice. We are mastering sharing our message with limited resources. The pandemic sort of levels the playing field ‚Äî now everyone has limited resources. Even SNL started performing with limited resources.</p>
<p>Sometimes, no audience equals no energy. But social media, retweets are the new audience. We spend so much time trying to crack each other up.</p>
<p>Hare: Social media gives you a sense of community. Memes become part of our community. I don‚Äôt care about likes or retweets ‚Äî I gotta go with my comic voice. I have to do what I think is funny.

<h3 id="instagram-is-bringing-back-90s-nollywood">&ldquo;Instagram Is Bringing Back &rsquo;90s Nollywood&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMjg3OTg5Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMDQ4MjQxN30.bm_hVATw5rFReRCqDN60AyzetUaJ1frrHfMkUb6cLt4/img.jpg?width=1200&amp;coordinates=0%2C146%2C0%2C147&amp;height=600" alt="img">
Nigeria&rsquo;s film industry is one of the largest in the world ‚Äî with big budgets, high production values and the star power of actors like Adesua Etomi-Wellington and Mawuli Gavor. But back in the &rsquo;90s and 2000s, Nollywood was known more for its cheesy direct-to-video hits like 1992&rsquo;s Living in Bondage. Think horrible CGI, overdramatized scenes and predictable archetypes and storylines.</p>
<p>Up until recently, this much-maligned golden age of cheaply produced movies was confined to VHS and DVD libraries. Then, in the early months of 2019, memes featuring &rsquo;90s Nollywood duo Osita Iheme and Chinedu Ikedieze went viral. Iheme and Ikedieze, who are often assumed to be teenagers but are actually aged in their 40s, are known for their theatrical over-acting ‚Äî one meme shows Ikedieze become starstruck by a girl&rsquo;s beauty, while another depicts Iheme taking sips of beer while exaggeratedly expressing his satisfaction. The over-the-top nature of these memes and short videos, a defining factor of movies from the era, made them an instant hit on the internet and social media, where they worked well as reaction images for any given tweet or thread. Another Nollywood clip of actress Funke Akindele from Tchidi Chikere&rsquo;s 2014 comedy Pretty Liars running and screaming also got memed. The movie Blood Sisters&rsquo; infamous &ldquo;keep being the bad girl that you are&rdquo; scene, featuring Nollywood A-lister Genevieve Nnaji, has now been recreated thousands of times.</p>
<p>The resurgence of these clips and stills is largely thanks to Instagram accounts lke Nollybabes and Yung Nollywood, who have taken it upon themselves to document the industry&rsquo;s past and share it with a new generation. The admins, in their 20s, are aware that what were once the biggest critiques of movies from that era ‚Äî bad acting, overdramatization, didacticism ‚Äî have become the reason they work so well as reaction GIFs. The femme fatale roles played by the original bad bitch Regina Asika, the bad-boy-who-just-came-back-to-Nigeria roles that Jim Iyke and Hank Anuku played for years, the mother-in-law/step-mother roles that actress Patience Ozukwor played so well. Not to mention the iconic brows of Eucharia Anunobi ‚Äî no YouTube beauty guru can compete.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;People are into stills from what we like to call the &lsquo;Golden Era of Nollywood&rsquo; ‚Äî mid 90s to the early noughties ‚Äî for two reasons,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tochi, one of the two Nigerian sisters living in New York running @Nolly.Babes tells PAPER. &lsquo;&lsquo;The first reason is the pure aesthetic appeal of the images. People will always appreciate beautiful black women dressed impeccably, and that&rsquo;s essentially what the image of a Nolly Babe is. These women continuously set trends by pushing the boundaries of both traditional and western style. Genevieve Nnaji&rsquo;s Gucci monogram looks would put Billie Eilish to shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Related | Sundance 2020 Was All About the Women</p>
<p>The second reason is the &ldquo;nostalgic value&rdquo; of the images. &ldquo;For many of us, these images are reminiscent of a simpler time that we&rsquo;d gladly go back to,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;It is this nostalgia as well as the irresistible glamour of that era that has allowed platforms like Nolly.Babes and Yung Nollywood to grow an almost cult-like online following that has spilled over into the real world.&rdquo; In December 2019, @Nolly.Babes held an old Nollywood era themed party at the Lagos concept store AL√ÅRA. The event had a large turnout of Lagos youth dressed in clothing expected from the golden era of Nollywood and the success of the event is a testament to how much influence Nollywood&rsquo;s past still has in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>These digital archivists aren&rsquo;t just documenting Nollywood&rsquo;s past ‚Äî by resharing these stills and short videos they are also influencing the Nigerian film industry today. Nollywood is catching up and realizing there&rsquo;s still an audience for the classics: 2019 saw the release of the sequel to Living In Bondage, credited as the movie that kickstarted the contemporary Nigerian film industry after its former glories of the 1960s, &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s faded away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It would be fair to assume that reboots have been influenced by the interest in old Nollywood generated by the images and clips we and our contemporaries share,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tochi tells PAPER. &lsquo;&lsquo;A Nneka the Pretty Serpent reboot is on the way, and I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s a coincidence that we had just scoured libraries across the United States to find a copy of the original to source clips that we recently posted on our page. I think it might be a stretch to take the credit for bringing these movies back into the forefront, but I think the general desire for these reboots is fueled by a movement we have had a hand in pushing.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nollywood&rsquo;s past is not only influencing the country&rsquo;s film industry, but pop culture at large. &lsquo;&lsquo;Nowadays, we see music videos, editorial shoots and fashion collections with very clear references to Nollywood,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ebele of Nolly Babes says. &lsquo;&lsquo;To us that shows that people are embracing a history and era that is unique to us as Nigerians.&rsquo;&rsquo; This is particularly evident in the &ldquo;alte&rdquo; subculture of young Nigerians who create art that deviates from what is considered mainstream. In the songs and music videos of artists like Santi, Odunsi The Engine and Lady Donli, elements of old Nollywood are heavily featured or referenced ‚Äî the visuals of Lady Donli&rsquo;s Corner Corner draw inspiration from old Nollywood aesthetics while singer Odunsi&rsquo;s music video for &ldquo;Wetin Dey&rdquo; is inspired by the 00s show Wetin Dey. These aesthetics have reached the fashion world, too: London-based Nigeria-born designer Mowlola Ogunlesi&rsquo;s 2019 collaboration with New Gallery is heavily inspired by old Nollywood as well as her Nigerian upbringing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Life is nothing but a cycle,&rsquo;&rsquo; Yung Nollywood tells PAPER on the resurgence of old Nollywood and its influence on the culture. &lsquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s cool will always be cool, it&rsquo;s just a matter of it coming back.&rsquo;&rsquo;

<p>By Jazmin Duribe</p>
<p>All hail the meme King.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re as internet-obsessed as us, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed all the Osita Iheme memes that have been flooding our timelines. The popular Nollywood (the Nigerian film industry) actor is a pretty big deal in Nigeria, but thanks to his popularity online, it won&rsquo;t be long until we see Osita on every television screen.</p>
<p>The best memes of 2019 (so far)</p>
<p>Osita, also know as Pawpaw, is best known for his role in 2002 comedy Aki na Ukwa. The movie, in which he played the role of Pawpaw, catapulted his career. In the role, Osita played a mischievous child alongside Chinedu Ikedieze, who often plays his on-screen brother. In real life, though, he isn&rsquo;t a child. Osita is actually 37-years-old but a rare condition gives him his younger appearance.</p>
<p>Keanu Reeves memes are taking over the internet and they&rsquo;re so pure</p>
<p>Memes from his movies have been floating around for a while now but everyone&rsquo;s talking about a particular scene from Stubborn Flies. The movie came out in 2007 and it&rsquo;s all about a man who wants to leave his parents to look for the perfect wife. In one scene from the movie, Osita is sitting on a chair holding a book and trying to piece something together.</p>
<p>As you know, the internet can&rsquo;t help itself when it comes to memes and now Pawpaw is going viral for the relatable clip.</p>

<h3 id="kerala-police-score-self-goal-with-sudani-from-nigeria-slur">&ldquo;Kerala Police score self-goal with ‚ÄòSudani from Nigeria‚Äô slur&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75750062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155171,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg" alt="img">
Robinson in a still from the movie ‚ÄòSudani from Nigeria‚Äô</p>
<p>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: An ‚Äòawareness‚Äô poster by Kerala Police was hurriedly taken down from its official page after the state&rsquo;s cyber cell cops, usually politically correct to a T, unwittingly equated online ‚ÄòNigerian scams‚Äô with that nation itself.</p>
<p>To raise awareness on &lsquo;advance-free-scams&rsquo; requesting money in the name of politicians and government authorities which have been on the rise during the Covid-19 pandemic, Kerala Police used images of actor Samuel Abiola Robinson who starred in ‚Äò Sudani from Nigeria ‚Äô, the much-acclaimed 2018 Malayalam movie about Nigerian footballers turning around the fortunes of a Malappuram ‚Äòsevens‚Äô team.</p>
<p>But the post backfired after Robinson protested vehemently against apparent racist prejudice. ‚ÄúJust because I&rsquo;m a Nigerian doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a fraudster. Actually many scams are of Chinese or Vietnam origin and they just use Nigerian code names. I am not a fraudster and I don&rsquo;t appreciate this. You are also not a RAPIST just because you are an Indian Man. Please stop generalizing these things. There are millions of Nigerians and billions of Indians. It&rsquo;s not very constructive to assume that all are the same,‚Äù Robinson wrote in a bilingual post on his official social media account.</p>
<p>‚ÄòI appreciate work Kerala Police does‚Äô</p>
<p>Ironically, the very title ‚ÄòSudani from Nigeria‚Äô signifies how people unconsciously, but dangerously, confuse ethnicities and origins, with football fans in the movie conveniently choosing to lump their star Nigerian player under a name commonly reserved for Africans in general. ‚ÄúI don&rsquo;t appreciate my image and likeness being used for things such as this. While I appreciate the work that the Kerala Police does, I in no way support fraud from any country and I don&rsquo;t appreciate being associated with it,‚Äù Robinson added in his post.</p>
<p>The official page of Kerala police has over 10 lakh followers and is hugely popular for its use of humour, memes and filmy dialogues to propagate awareness messages. Nodal officer of Kerala Police ‚Äòcyberdome‚Äô Manoj Abraham said that the post was deleted on Wednesday itself. Stating that the social media team of Kerala Police is open to corrections, he said &ldquo;there is need to educate the public on scams‚Äù. Robinson recently moved to India to build his budding career.</p>
