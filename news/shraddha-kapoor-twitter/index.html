<p>Shraddha Kapoor posts a heartfelt tweet on Sushant Singh Rajput death who committed suicide earlier today in his apartment in Bandra, Mumbai. The actor’s body was found hanging to a fan around 12 PM Jun 14, 2020.</p>
<p>The entire film fraternity is shocked by the demise of ‘Kai Po Che’ fame Sushant. Nobody anticipated that such a healthy and intellectual individual would take such a big step to end his life.</p>
<p>Chhichhore was the first project when Shraddha and Sushant worked together on-screen. The movie became a nationwide hit, Sushant played the love of Shraddha’s life and they both helped their son cope up with the depression of failing an IIT-Entrance examination.</p>
<p>In an interview with PinkVilla, Shraddha described her co-actor as the hardest working man she has ever met on-screen and off-screen. The sheer intensity and dedication blew her away.</p>
<p>Shradha said, “Sushant always makes us laugh and when the times comes to be serious, like when we are shooting a scene. He is the most hard-working person I’ve seen, he workout his dialogues and facial expressions to make the scene perfect. Mr. Perfectionist won’t be wrong to say.”</p>
<p>The death of two famous Bollywood actors Rishi Kapoor &amp; Irrfan Khan had already left everyone weeping, and Sushant Singh’s demise comes as a nuclear bomb on top of it. His fans, family and loved ones are most affected by his death.</p>
<p>Read: YouTubers CarryMinati, Ashish, etc Mourn Sushant Singh’s Death</p>
<p>Shraddha posted a heartfelt message on her twitter to grieve the death of a hard-working co-actor Sushant Singh Rajput who died of unknown reasons. She is devastated that such a jolly person could have been going through a lot of mental stress and trauma.</p>
<p>Shraddha Kapoor will always regret that she did not get a chance to say goodbye and probably help Rajput with the depression. Small talk could have gone a long way, that’s what most of his friends and family will regret.</p>
<p>Read Shraddha Kapoor tweet on Sushant Singh Rajput death:-</p>
<p>Shraddha Kapoor on Sushant Singh Rajput’s Death</p>
<p>*Shraddha has not commented anything on the death of Sushant. We’ll update this section as soon as she replies to this topic.</p>
<p>Not fair Sushi! One week everything changed! Not fair my baby! pic.twitter.com/aEnWaOlrXR — Ekta Kapoor (@ektarkapoor) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput – The Allrounder</p>
<p>Allrounder, that is the word which describes Sushant Singh Rajput as a whole. The actor was highly intellectual, had scored a single-digit rank in AIEEE, and dropped out of college to pursue his dream to be a Bollywood actor.</p>
<p>Sushant, 34, set a benchmark in the industry for younger generations to follow. He was an inspiration to budding actors. Movies like ‘Kai Po Che’, PK, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Chhichhore, etc. will always be remembered for the impeccable performance he delivered.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh’s latest project ‘Dil Bechara’ was slated to release in 2020. It’s unfortunate that we will no more see Sushant’s latest movies. His death has left a void in our hearts.</p>
<p>The reason for death is not confirmed yet as the actor did not leave any suicide ‘note’. We shall wait for further details from his team.</p>
<p>Watch Shraddha Kapoor on Sushant Singh’s Death</p>
<p>Watch as Shraddha and Sushant laughs with the comedian Zakhir Khan during a promotional campaign of Chhichhore.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more news.

<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/news/kerala/images/2020/6/4/elephant-twitter.jpg" alt="img">
The killing of a pregnant elephant in Kerala, which ate a pineapple stuffed with firecrackers, allegedly set as a trap for wild boars, has set off a storm on social media.</p>
<p>The Kerala government has launched a probe into the incident while the Centre has sought a report from the state.</p>
<p>Heartbroken over the inhuman behaviour of the killers, celebrities, including cricket and Bollywood stars, took to their social media accounts to vent their anger and mark their protest.</p>
<p>India cricket captain Virat Kohli, spinner HarbhajanSingh, Bollywood actors Akshay Kumar, Anushka Sharma and Alia Bhat have joined animal-loving netizens to condemn the killing of the elephant. #KeralaElephantMurder was trending on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appalled to hear about what happened in Kerala. Let&rsquo;s treat our animals with love and bring an end to these cowardly acts,&rdquo; Kohli said in a tweet from his Twitter handle.</p>

<p>Ace India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh posted a series of angry faced emoticons on a newsfeed of the incident.</p>
<p>“Maybe animals are less wild and humans less human. What happened with that #elephant is heartbreaking, inhumane and unacceptable!” Akshay Kumar tweeted. He also sought strict action against the culprits.</p>
<p>In an Instagram post, narrated the story of the elephant&rsquo;s death and tagged Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. She also shared a heartening sketch of an imaginary conversation between the mother elephant and her unborn baby. The picture was credited it to Bratuti.</p>
<p>“From anybody who throws stones at a stray dog to anybody hurting a living soul, choose one face. A lot of these animals trust human beings because they have been helped by them in the past. This is cruel beyond measure. When you lack empathy and kindness, you do not deserve to be called a human being. To hurt someone is not human,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Shraddha Kapoor wondered how could such an incident happen. “How?????? How can something like this happen??? Do people not have hearts??? My heart has shattered and broken&hellip; The perpetrators need to be punished in the STRICTEST way,” tweeted.</p>

<p>An angry Alia Bhatt termed the incident &lsquo;just terrible&rsquo;. She wrote on Instagram, “We need to be their voice and coexist! Is this meant to be some kind of sick joke??”</p>
<p>Retweeting Sraddha Kapoor&rsquo;s tweet, Rajkumar Rao also sought action against the perpetrators of the crime.</p>
<p>A number of people from various parts of the country joined the campaign on the Twitter and wrote emotional posts.</p>
<p>“They not only killed the mother and the baby. They also killed the TRUST ON HUMANS forever,” wrote Pankaj Nain IPS.</p>

THE EPISODE STARTS WHEN THE THREE GIRLS LAUGH AND WISH EACH OTHER GOODNIGHT.</p>
<p>AT SAMEER’S HOUSE IN THE MORNING</p>
<p>“Mummy!! Mummy!!” calls out Sameer from the washroom. “What is it?” asks Vishakha standing outside the washroom. “You can come inside. I still have my clothes on.” laughs Sameer and Vishakha comes inside. “There is no toothpaste. Please bring a new one.” he requests. “How come is it finished? I just bought it a month ago!!! And I won’t be going outside to buy a new one until I take a bath and get dressed.” says Vishakha curiously. “You are a drama queen, mummy. What should I do? I will not go to school without brushing my teeth.” tells Sameer and thinks worriedly, “What if Naina comes to talk to me by any chance, I will smell bad and she will never talk to me again.” Vishakha sees him lost and claps in front of his eyes to get him back into his senses. “Please do something. Papa has gone for a walk but how will we tell him to buy a toothpaste? I wish there was a phone which we could take anywhere along and talk to each other.” he says. “Don’t dream in the day. There is no such phone. Anyways let me try.” she says and brings a scissor along to cut open the toothpaste and says “SEE, MIDDLE- CLASS JUGAAD(tricks)!! There is some toothpaste left in there. Use it and I will buy a new one today” Sameer laughs and takes it.</p>
<p>IN NAINA’S ROOM</p>
<p>“Oh no!!!” Naina shouts and Preeti asks what is wrong. “We did not buy the stuff we need for the plan. How will we execute it?” Naina asks. Preeti smiles and asks her to relax. “Just wait and watch.” says Preeti and walks in the hall followed by Naina. “Chacha Ji, please help us. We are in deep trouble.” requests Preeti being kind. “Sure. What do you need?” asks Anand. “Actually, we needed some things for a school project but we forgot to buy them. Can we leave right now and buy those?” she asks and Naina stares at her thinking, “What is wrong with her? She will spoil everything.” “Ok. Bela, give them the breakfast and they can eat in the car.” Anand says and Bela agrees.</p>
<p>Preeti thanks them and they leave. “What are you doing?” whispers Naina. “Just trust me and if you love me, you will not say a word until I ask you to, please.” requests Preeti and as soon as Naina hears it, she shuts her mouth. While Preeti buys all the stuff, Anand asks, “What will you do with these things? And which teacher asked you to bring these?” “It is for an experiment. I don’t know the name of the teacher but he teaches CHEMISTRY.” Preeti informs and Naina lightly slaps on her own forehead and gets more worried. “But there is still one hour left for school. What will you two do till then? There will be no one in the school.” asks Anand and Preeti replies, “That’s ok Chacha Ji. We will sit in the class and study. Anyways, we don’t want to waste money on petrol going back to home and coming again.” Anand smiles hearing that.</p>
<p>As soon as Anand drops them to the school, they both keep all the stuff they bought in their school bags and meet Swati. “Hey we have brought everything. And there is no one except us here. But to have more security, do you know a place where no one usually comes?” asks Preeti and Swati takes them to the store room and they finish all the planning and get ready to execute. “Naina, I am sure this will work. But still, all the best.” says Swati and Naina gives her a thumbs up. Swati says,“I did not know that you were so serious about this that you are on a MAUN VRAT!” “Oops!! I totally forgot. She is not on any Maun Vrat. I just asked her to stay quiet. Sorry Naina, you can speak now.” says Preeti and Naina speaks in single breath, “Finally!!! Are you crazy, Preeti? Why did you buy all the stuff in front of Chacha Ji? He will surely know once we execute the plan and then he will definitely…” she suddenly stops while Preeti continues, “And then he will definitely throw us out of the school AND THE HOME TOO.” “I thought you were dumb but you turned out to be smarter than me.” Naina says and Preeti speaks rolling her eyes, “Was that a compliment or a taunt?” “It’s up to you. However you want to take it.” tells Swati and the three laugh. “Now we just have to hang this in such a way that nobody sees it and it will work only once we pull the rope. We will have to sit in the corner next to the door today.” informs Naina. “But Sameer, Munna, and Pandit sit there. Naina, you could talk to Sameer and ask if we three could sit there today.” mocks Preeti. “Why me? We will decide then only. Now focus on hanging this up.” answers Naina.</p>
<p>IN THE CLASSROOM</p>
<p>The girls sit on the desk in the corner as they hide the rope beside them and when the boys come, the first thing Sameer does is look for Naina all around without noticing that she is sitting on his desk. “Where is Naina…I mean where are Naina, Preeti and Swati?” asks Sameer looking around and Munna tells pointing at their bench, “TU POORE MOHALLE MEIN DHOOND RAHA HAI AUR WO HAMARE GHAR MEIN BAITHI HAIN (YOU ARE SEARCHING THE WHOLE SOCIETY AND THEY ARE SITTING IN OUR HOME)” Finally, Sameer sees Naina who unknowingly asks him, “Can we PLEASE sit here for today?” and Sameer doesn’t take a second to reply, “Of course. We will sit on your place. That’s totally fine and you don’t need to request because…” Munna interrupts, “Alright. She understood. Now let’s go.” and pulls Sameer away along with Pandit. Naina thinks, “I was not supposed to ask him. We had to decide first but why did I?” while Preeti and Swati smile seeing her so confused. “Get ready. The first lecture is going to start in a minute.” whispers Swati.</p>
<p>AS SOON AS THE CHEMISTRY TEACHER ENTERS THE CLASS, THE GIRLS PULL THE ROPE AND A BUCKET FILLED WITH A MIXTURE OF WHEAT FLOUR, WATER, GLUE, AND ROTTEN EGGS FALL ON THE TEACHER’S HEAD!!!

After the people showed their outrage against the horrific and shocking death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala, another news about the attack on a pregnant cow has left the country in a state of shock. An avid animal lover, Shraddha Kapoor shared a post on social media while venting out her anger against animal cruelty. She even demanded stricter laws for such barbaric incidents.</p>

<p>A pregnant cow’s mouth was allegedly blown off by an explosive while it was grazing at a field in the Jhanduta area of Bilaspur district in Himachal Pradesh. A video showing the injuries sustained by the cow has gone viral. In the video, the cow’s owner Gurdial Singh sought help from authorities, demanding strict action against the perpetrator. Singh goes on to blame his neighbour Nandlal for “intentionally” injuring the cow. He added that Nandlal has run away after the incident.</p>
<p>Sometime back, Shraddha shared a post on her Twitter handle where she demanded stricter laws against animal cruelty while starting a petition online. The petition says ‘help animals suffering because of weak cruelty penalties.’ Further, the petition described the cruelties faced by dogs who are poisoned, cows are burnt with acid, and countless other animals across India that are abused every day – and the current penalties are often not enough to deter people who want to harm them.</p>
<p>Apart from starting the petition online, the actor fumed her anger on her Instagram page where she wrote about people who have turned cruel towards animals. She further narrated the entire incident that happened in Kerala’s Malappuram and called the humans as ‘monsters’ who would throw stones at a stray dog and can hurt a living soul. She called out at humans who lack empathy and kindness towards animals and wrote that they do not deserve to be called humans because of their cruel acts. The Baaghi actor demanded stricter and decent laws against such cruelty done to animals because the actress feels that until and unless the guilty are punished in the worst possible way, these “wicked monsters” will never fear the law.</p>
