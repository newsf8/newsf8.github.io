<p>Roman Kemp broke down in tears live on his Capital Breakfast radio show on Monday as he returned to work following the death of the show&rsquo;s producer, Joe Lyons.</p>
<p>The presenter and his co-stars Sian Welby, 33, and Sonny Jay, 27, took time off from the show last Tuesday after hearing the sad news.</p>
<p>And Roman, 27, took the decision to talk to viewers about how he was feeling on Monday as he paid tribute to his &lsquo;best friend&rsquo; Joe. His cause of death has not been revealed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was our best mate&rsquo;: Roman Kemp broke down in tears live on air on Monday as he returned to work at Capital Breakfast following the death of producer Joe Lyons</p>
<p>Breaking down, he said: &lsquo;We wanted to share some really sad news. I never thought I’d have to do this ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Last Tuesday, very suddenly, we lost one of our best friends. Our producer Joe, he was a member of the Capital Breakfast family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are trying to process this all together. We wanted to share this news with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roman continued: &lsquo;Joe had worked for Global, the parent company, for nine years.</p>
<p>Sad news: Joe, known on the show as Producer Joe has sadly passed away - his cause of death has not been revealed - this was his last Instagram post, shared on June 20</p>
<p>Painful: Roman struggled to contain his emotions during the show</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was the very first person I met when I walked through the door. I remember thinking he was a bit of a Del Boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was with me right from my very first show. He taught be everything. I don’t know sitting in a radio studio without him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Discussing their close bond, Roman added: &lsquo;He’s the person I’d sit here and rinse constantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He loved dogs. Obsessed with his daily step count. Never ironed his clothes. He loved his family so much. His dad Ivan, his mum Celia, his sister Lou.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did love his friends… his fans, he did have fans. The thing he loved most of all was doing this show, you listening.</p>
<p>Roman said of his friend: &lsquo;He loved dogs. Obsessed with his daily step count. Never ironed his clothes. He loved his family so much. His dad Ivan, his mum Celia, his sister Lou&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was like a genius coming up with these ideas. He was driven by the reaction from you every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roman&rsquo;s mother, Shirlie Kemp wrote on Joe&rsquo;s final Instagram post, shared on June 20, &lsquo;God Bless you Joe &hellip;. you were and always will be so loved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fellow Capital Breakfast presenter Vick Hope, took to Instagram on Monday morning to pay tribute to Joe.</p>
<p>Sharing a series of pictures of them, she wrote: &lsquo;Our Joe. My JoeJoe. My special, magical, beautiful friend. We signed off every message with &ldquo;I love you, buddy&rdquo;, and yet I’m worried I still didn’t tell you enough.</p>
<p>Devastated: The radio host, 27, and his co-stars Sian Welby and Sonny Jay (all pictured) came off air mid-way through their radio show on Tuesday after learning the heartbreaking news</p>
<p>Hearbroken: Sian broke down in tears as Roman paid tribute to Joe on Monday</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really do love you, bud, so so much. We all do. I hope you know that. We are so lucky to have known you. The world is a better place for having had you in it. And now the stars have gained an extraordinary gift in you. Look at everything you made, Joe. Everything you achieved, what you built, who you inspired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your talent and creativity are so immense, but more than that you are the kindest, most hilarious, caring, fun, fiercely loyal and spectacular person any of us had the pleasure of meeting. You really are the best one we ever knew. Our friend. My friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the last four years you have been my solace, my rock, my confidante. I’ve told you all my secrets, and you said you’d take them to the grave. And now it seems you did just that, and it breaks my heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Words cannot describe this pain, it doesn’t make sense and it’ll take time to process. I keep repeating: Not you, please not you. But now you’re at peace, you’re in a better place. I’m going to miss you Joe Lyons, so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She continued: &lsquo;Thank you for every crab dance, every &ldquo;you’re embarrassing us babe&rdquo;, every cereal box game, every 5am-er at a houseparty we’re not invited to, every &ldquo;bah bah&rdquo;, every undersized chino, every photobomb courtesy of your a**e, every cocktail we shook in your flat or evening spent in my yard doing things we shouldn’t on a school night, every club we sat in the corner of scheming, every time we were back and ready to do it all over again, every single damn laugh, every hug that meant the world because you made me feel safe and understood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And thank you for being my favourite valentine. We met our match in each other. I’ve never encountered anyone else as weird and as wild, and together we were chaos.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wherever you are I hope you’re causing chaos there too. We never wanted the party to end, and I don’t believe this one is over either; I’ll just see you at the afterparty. Until then, I love you, buddy. My thoughts are with your parents and Lou; Ro, Sonny and the team; Olly and everyone who loves you.&rsquo;</p>

Capital Breakfast Show producer Joe Lyons has received moving tributes after dying suddenly last week.</p>
<p>The talented producer died on August 4 and news of his death prompted his best friend and radio host Roman Kemp to take a sudden break from the show from Wednesday until the end of last week.</p>
<p>Returning to the Capital FM show today (August 10), Roman paid a moving tribute to his late friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the very first person I met when I walked through the door,&rdquo; said Roman. &ldquo;I remember thinking he was a bit of a Del Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tearful Roman added: &ldquo;He was with me right from my very first show. He taught me everything. I don’t know sitting in a radio studio without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moving messages also continued on Joe&rsquo;s Instagram page, with many sharing their love for the late producer.</p>

<p>Roman&rsquo;s mum Shirlie Kemp wrote: &ldquo;God Bless you Joe &hellip;. you were and always will be so loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another fan of Joe&rsquo;s commented: &ldquo;RIP joe&hellip;you are deeply missed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another added: &ldquo;Such sad news&hellip; RIP Joe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Radio 1 presenter Greg James wrote on Twitter: &ldquo;This is unbearably sad news. I’m so sorry to hear this. Incredibly brave to go on air and do such an amazing tribute. Please look after yourselves. Sending all my love x&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear Joe will be very much missed by his loved ones and followers.</p>
<p>Who is Roman Kemp&rsquo;s friend Joe Lyons?</p>
<p>Joe Lyons was the Senior Producer at Capital Breakfast from April 2017 until his death in August 2020.</p>
<p>He had previously worked with Roman on his Capital Evening Show from March 2016 until they both moved to the Breakfast show, which he created.</p>
<p>The producer had worked at Capital&rsquo;s parent company, Global since June 2011, first as a freelance producer, including on Classic FM before moving to Capital in 2012.</p>
<p>Joe also did work experience at the Daily Mirror in the early days of his career.</p>
<p>Laurie Hanna, former Daily Mirror journalist and now Amnesty Press reporter, tweeted: &ldquo;Oh this is heartbreaking news I looked after Joe when he came in to do work experience at the Daily Mirror many years ago: he was such a lovely, funny young man and I loved seeing how well he had done in the years that followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: Instagram)</p>
<p>Joe was educated at the University of Leeds and had a Masters in Radio Journalism from Goldsmith&rsquo;s College, University of London.</p>
<p>He previously attended Royal Grammar School, Guildford.</p>
<p>The producer was active on Instagram (handle @ProducerJoe and Twitter (handle @joe_lyons), where he spent much of his time posting moments from his work on Capital with Roman.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Big Music Project in 2017, Joe talked about what it was like working with Roman.</p>
<p>(Image: Instagram)</p>
<p>(Image: Instagram)</p>
<p>Joe revealed: &ldquo;Oh my God! He&rsquo;s brilliant. I love him, he&rsquo;s like one of my best mates as well. It&rsquo;s quite funny with him because I started on overnights with him and I did his first demo with him and he impressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny going from the 1 to 5ams where we&rsquo;re sort of blagging it a little bit and chatting about the music and seeing as we go and don&rsquo;t get called out on it. Going from there and in three years and he&rsquo;s done this evening show and we left it in the number one spot, which was really impressive for both of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he&rsquo;s done that and we made some really cool viral content which he&rsquo;s known for, and now he&rsquo;s got the Breakfast Show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: CAPITAL / TWITTER)</p>
<p>The producer added: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the youngest ever Capital Breakfast presenter, 23. It&rsquo;s more amazing that he&rsquo;s done it in three years, from the overnights to what is arguably the biggest gig in radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe concluded: &ldquo;I love him, he&rsquo;s great. Top bloke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp continues on weekdays from 6am to 10am.</p>

<p>TikTok sensation Addison Rae usually posts multiple TikToks a day, so when she suddenly went silent on social media, fans had some wild theories about why this was, from pregnancy, to drowning, but she&rsquo;s now spoken out.</p>
<p>Addison Rae has been in the news a whole lot this week after her social media absence had people wildly speculating about why she&rsquo;d left her biggest platform, TikTok, and rumours of everything to pregnancy to her death have swamped the internet.</p>
<p>So, why did the TikTok sensation disappear, and why has she posted an apology statement online?</p>
<p>Addison Rae Apologises For Re-Posting &lsquo;All Lives Matter&rsquo; Video &amp; The Internet Is Divided</p>
<p>Has Addison Rae died?</p>
<p>The 19-year-old has just under 50 million TikTok followers and is one of the biggest names in the world right now, so when she went silent for over a week, fans who are used to interacting with her multiple times a day were seriously worried something had happened.</p>
<p>Some speculated she may be pregnant, while another, darker theory even suggest she had died. One gossip blog posted a fake report which added serious fuel to the fire and one rumour suggested she&rsquo;d been taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Rumours online said Addison Rae had &lsquo;drowned&rsquo; during social media silence. Picture: Twitter</p>
<p>However, her boyfriend, fellow famous TikToker, Bryce Hall, eventually spoke out to reassure fans Addison was fine, taking some time, and was not pregnant.</p>
<p>He said on TikTok: &ldquo;Addison is OK and she&rsquo;s not in the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where that even&hellip;like half the stuff that&rsquo;s just pulled up on social media, like how does that even happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, no, Addison is absolutely fine and healthy, and was taking a purposeful break from the app.</p>
<p>Why did Addison Rae stop using TikTok?</p>
<p>In fact, the reason Addison took a break from all social media was due to a video she had re-posted supporting &lsquo;all lives matter&rsquo; going viral, with people calling her out for damaging the Black Lives Matter cause.</p>
<p>Posting a statement online, Addison said: &ldquo;Addison,19, wrote: &ldquo;I owe all of you an apology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years ago, I reposted a video which included a woman sharing her thoughts on Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter that I should not have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued: &ldquo;Because of my privilege, I didn&rsquo;t understand and wasn&rsquo;t educated enough on the social injustices facing the Black community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All lives CANNOT matter until Black lives do. The Black community continues to be oppressed and damaged by systemic racism.&rdquo;</p>
