<p><img src="https://s24529.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/125202951_web1_125202951-c45364913d8746678324fbad0ed9d4f4.jpg" alt="img">
NEW YORK — Stressed out while working at a bank in New Zealand, Junelle Kunin began searching for music paired with teachings from the Dalai Lama to calm herself down and allow herself to focus.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t find it online.</p>
<p>That’s when the musician and practicing Buddhist proposed an idea to The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama: Let’s make an album fusing music with mantras and chants from the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>
<p>She was politely turned down.</p>
<p>But on a trip to India — where Kunin says she typically gets a chance to meet the Dalai Lama — she asked again, this time writing a letter and handing it to one of his assistants.</p>
<p>Five years later, “Inner World” is born. The album featuring teachings and mantras by the Dalai Lama set to music will be released on July 6, his 85th birthday.</p>
<p>“I’d never heard him speak like this. He really was so excited … he actually proceeded to explain to me how important music is,” Kunin said. “He leaned forward and his eyes were sparkling, and his fingers were rubbing together and he (talked) about how music can help people in a way that he can’t; it can transcend differences and return us to our true nature and our good heartedness.”</p>
<p>The 11-track project will be released in conjunction with a companion booklet.</p>
<p>On her trip to India in 2015, Kunin wrote down a list of topics and mantras she thought would be great for the album, and recorded the conversations with the Dalai Lama for “Inner World.” The religious leader recites the mantras of seven Buddhas on the album, discussing topics like wisdom, courage, healing and children. The track “Compassion,” one of the most famous Buddhist prayers, was released Tuesday.</p>
<p>When Kunin returned home, her husband, Abraham, who is also a musician and producer, helped her create music and sounds to enhance the Dalai Lama’s messages and powerful words.</p>
<p>Kunin said that although they’ve worked on the album for the last five years, it feels extremely relevant releasing it now.</p>
<p>“The entire purpose of this project is to try to help people. It’s not a Buddhist project, it’s to help everyday people like myself, even though I am Buddhist,” she said. “The messages couldn’t be more poignant for our current social climate and needs as humanity.”</p>
<p>Net proceeds from the sales of the album will benefit Mind &amp; Life Institute as well as Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning (SEE Learning), an international education program developed by Emory University and the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Grammy-nominated sitar player Anoushka Shankar makes a guest appearance on the album, playing on “Ama La,” a track honoring mothers. Shankar said being invited to perform on the album was “a huge honor.”</p>
<p>She first met The Dalai Lama as a child with her father, the legendary musician Ravi Shankar.</p>
<p>For the new album, she said, “What I was given was a beautiful template of (the Dalai Lama’s) voice speaking … it was very evocative with his speaking. It’s so clear what the mood is about … that it kind of flowed quite simply to just play over that and try to add a musical enhancement to the words he’s speaking.”</p>
<p>Dozens of other musicians were invited to help on the project, while Kunin’s husband had multiple roles, from playing guitar and percussion to drum and synth programming. Kunin co-produced the album and added vocals to three songs, including “Purification.”</p>
<p>She wrote the piano part of that track with her hospitalized mother in mind, growing more nervous as the coronavirus rapidly spread.</p>
<p>“I really thought we were going to lose her. And so I wrote what I would want her to feel and hear at the time of her dying,” Kunin said.</p>
<p>Her mother survived, but weeks later Kunin’s nephew died. And because of COVID-19 restrictions, she and her family couldn’t carry out the tradition of sleeping surrounding his body, which would typically lie on a marae for three days. On top of that, her husband was back home finishing the album to make its deadline.</p>
<p>“(My husband) was home weeping at this point, which is when the inspiration came to complete the song ‘Purification,’” Kunin said, adding that they dedicated the track to their nephew Izyah Micah Toli.</p>
<p>“And he finished it.”

<p>Top Pick: Artemis Fowl (2020)</p>
<p>Based on Eoin Colfer&rsquo;s YA novel of the same name, the movie version of Artemis Fowl has been a long time coming. The story of 12-year-old genius Artemis (Ferdia Shaw), first published in 2001, has been considered for adaptation multiple times by multiple studios — but only ever came to fruition at Disney. Then, of course, the COVID-19 pandemic happened and the film&rsquo;s intended theatrical release got moved to streaming.</p>

<p>Celebrate this movie finally reaching our homes by joining Artemis, his dad (Colin Farrell), Holly Short (Lara McDonnell), Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad), Commander Root (Judi Dench), and more of your favorite characters for a streamable adventure in Artemis&rsquo;s fantastical, criminal exploits. Of course, we can&rsquo;t vouch for the movie yet&hellip;but based on the trailer? Our hopes are sky-high.</p>

One More Trailer for Disney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Artemis Fowl&rsquo; Confirms Streaming Debut</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mission – is to steal it.&rdquo; Disney has released one more official trailer for the long-awaited Artemis Fowl movie, an epic adaptation of the fantasy book series by Eoin Colfer. This trailer confirms that the movie will be available streaming on Disney+ on June 12th, skipping theaters entirely (due to the pandemic shutdown). The story follows a 12-year-old mastermind named Artemis Fowl, who discovers a world below ground of armed and dangerous&ndash;and extremely high-tech&ndash;fairies. He kidnaps one of them, Holly Short, and holds her for ransom in an effort to restore his family&rsquo;s fortune and find his father. Ferdia Shaw stars as Artemis, and the full cast includes Lara McDonnell as Captain Holly Short, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, Nonso Anozie, Tamara Smart, Miranda Raison, Joshua McGuire, and Hong Chau. This looks like it might be an entertaining adventure, probably best they&rsquo;re dropping it online right away. Family-time fun.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the final official trailer for Kenneth Branagh&rsquo;s Artemis Fowl, direct from Disney&rsquo;s YouTube:</p>
<p>You can still watch the teaser trailer for Branagh&rsquo;s Artemis Fowl here, or the full trailer from this year.</p>
<p>Descended from a long line of criminal masterminds, 12-year-old genius Artemis Fowl finds himself in a battle of strength and cunning against a powerful, hidden race of fairies who may be behind his father’s disappearance. Newcomer Ferdia Shaw plays the title character, with Lara McDonnell (Love, Rosie) playing Captain Holly Short, a feisty, spirited elf, who is kidnapped by Artemis for a ransom of fairy gold. Artemis Fowl is directed by Irish actor-filmmaker Kenneth Branagh, director of the films Mary Shelley&rsquo;s Frankenstein, Hamlet, Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost, As You Like It, The Magic Flute, Sleuth, Thor, Macbeth, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Cinderella, and Murder on the Orient Express previously. The screenplay is written by Michael Goldenberg, Adam Kline, and Conor McPherson; adapted from Eoin Colfer&rsquo;s book of the same name. Disney will debut Artemis Fowl direct-to-streaming on Disney+ starting June 12th coming up soon.

Artemis Fowl will end its long, strange trip to release on June 12th. The film was slated to hit theaters this summer, and when the theaters shut down and began shuttering, many wondered what would become of the adaptation of the beloved book series by Eoin Colfer. Disney then decided to surprise most by announcing the film would skip theaters entirely and head straight to its Disney+ streaming service. It ends 19 years of development, which includes many different studios and names attached to the film. Even Disney has pushed the completed film back once. It was initially supposed to come out on August 9th, 2019, and was delayed till May 29th, 2020. You can watch the new Artemis Fowl trailer below.</p>
<p>Artemis Fowl Synopsis and Poster</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Artemis Fowl,&rdquo; based on the beloved book by Eoin Colfer, is a fantastical, spellbinding adventure that follows the journey of 12-year-old genius Artemis Fowl, a descendant of a long line of criminal masterminds, as he seeks to find his father who has mysteriously disappeared. With the help of his loyal protector Butler, Artemis sets out to find him, and in doing so uncovers an ancient, underground civilization—the amazingly advanced world of fairies. Deducing that his father&rsquo;s disappearance is somehow connected to the secretive, reclusive fairy world, cunning Artemis concocts a dangerous plan—so dangerous that he ultimately finds himself in a perilous war of wits with the all-powerful fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My little brother was obsessed with these books when he was growing up, and according to him, this film looks incredible. I think it holds promise for sure. Kenneth Branagh is in the director&rsquo;s chair, and if nothing else, he always gets the most he can get out of his actors. Having Josh Gad, Colin Farrell, and Judi Dench will undoubtedly help. It will all come down to Ferdia Shaw and how he handles the leading role, though.</p>
<p>Disney +'s Biggest Debut Yet</p>
<p>This is by far the biggest debut Disney+ has had in its brief existence. Onward had already been in theaters when it hit the service earlier in April. Artemis Fowl carries a $125 million budget with it, and there are so many questions that come with this debut. If it is streamed like crazy, do they do a sequel and put it in theaters? Would it have the same budget? If it bombs, would they blame it on the lack of theatrical release? It is all so fascinating. We will all find out together on June 12th.
