<p>Broadway hitmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda (In the Heights) appeared via video chat on Monday’s episode of Good Morning America (ABC) to discuss the filming and streaming launch of his multi-Tony-winning sensation Hamilton on Disney+ and how he and his family are keeping busy during COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>The multitalented entertainer even revealed a new, hush-hush musical animated feature project in the works with Disney. Miranda wrote original songs for the studio’s 2016 hit Moana — including the Oscar-nominated, Grammy-winning tune “How Far I’ll Go.”</p>
<p>“The other thing I’m working on, I’m actually writing a new animated musical with Disney Animation,” Miranda told hosts Michael Strahan, Amy Robach and George Stephanopoulos. “I’m collaborating with the Zootopia guys and Jared Bush, who wrote Moana with me.”</p>
<p>As well as being credited with the final Moana screenplay, Jared Bush co-directed and co-wrote Oscar and Golden Globe-winning feature Zootopia — directed by Byrond Howard (Tangled, Bolt) and Rich Moore (Wreck-It Ralph, Ralph Breaks the Internet).</p>
<p>“It’s set in Colombia, in Latin America — and that’s all I can say before Bob Iger just shows up in my apartment,” he added, referring to the Walt Disney Co. executive chairman.</p>
<p>The untitled project joins Miranda’s busy slate, which also includes songwriting for Sony Pictures Animation’s Vivo — a CG musical comedy which follows a capuchin monkey with a thirst for adventure and a passage for music, who makes the treacherous journey from Havana to Miami to fulfill his destiny. Kirk DeMicco (The Croods) is directing the pic, which is slated for release June 4, 2021.</p>
<p>The filmed production of Hamilton bows on Disney+ July 3.</p>

Lin-Manuel Miranda has become joined at the hip to Disney in the last few years. After working on the music for Moana, he co-starred in Mary Poppins Returns. In addition to working on the music for Encanto, he&rsquo;s also handling musical duties for the live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. Finally, his Broadway hit Hamilton will be debuting on Disney+ next month. The partnership has been nothing but gold so far, and Encanto sounds like it could be a beautiful film. Hopefully, we won&rsquo;t have to wait too long to get a look at it, and maybe get a taste of how that music sounds as well.

<h3 id="let-moana-play-pro-basketball">&ldquo;Let Moana play pro basketball&rdquo;</h3>

Moana is 7’6. You read that right. At least that’s what comes up when you Google “How tall is Moana.” That means that the star of the 2016 Disney movie can take a different career path now that she has defeated Te Kā: professional basketball.</p>
<p>And with the NBA possibly resuming its season at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, this is the perfect time for her to test her on-court skills. It’s convenient for Moana because she doesn’t have to travel this time around; she lives in Disney World.</p>
<p>If the NBA can resume their season in the three arenas at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, the WNBA should adapt a similar plan when they’re ready to start their 2020 season.</p>
<p>From a corporate mindset, think of the synergy behind this. The NBA and WNBA have televisions deal with ESPN, which is owned by Disney. Commercials touting Disney’s next biggest summer blockbuster can be seen ad nauseam between game breaks in the playoffs. The next step would be to include your favorite Disney personalities in the game. Adding Mickey Mouse to a pickup game seems like the obvious fist step, but he’s only two or three feet tall. He’s one hundred percent getting crossed over or getting lost on defense. And we haven’t even talked about how his shoes, which are arguably the twice the size of his head, will interfere with his footwork. Also he’s a mouse.</p>
<p>Moana is a human and more importantly she’s tall. At 7’6 Moana would be the tallest WNBA player in history, towering over even 7’2 center Margo Dydek. To put it into perspective, that’s as tall as Yao Ming, who makes Shaquille O’Neal look like he needs a stepladder to high-five the Houston Rockets legend. The only pro basketball players who would be taller than Moana throughout the history of both the NBA and WNBA would be Manute Bol and Gheorghe Mureșan. And she would only be shorter by only one inch.</p>
<p>She possess the leadership qualities as well. At the end of the movie, Moana becomes chief and her island’s wayfinder, meaning that she has to instruct her people across the seas. Those are the qualities of an efficient point guard. Her ability to instruct others combined with her height makes her less of a dominant post player and more of a basketball unicorn, a vertically-gifted player who plays more like a guard.</p>
<p>When the film was released in 2016, Moana was 16 years old. That would put her at 20 years old now, making it the perfect time for WNBA scouts to start doing their research. She may not make the immediate impact that someone like Sabrina Ionescu will, but she could be a third-round selection with raw talent. Have her learn from the WNBA vets from the bench for a season or two and maybe Moana can be ready in a few years.</p>
<p>If Moana could defeat Te Kā as a giant lava demon, then Moana surely has a small opportunity to compete on the basketball court. Height isn’t everything, but Moana possesses all the intangibles that could lead to a fruitful pro basketball career. Who knows how far she’ll go.</p>
<p>You may be asking, if Moana is a seven footer, then how tall is Maui and wouldn’t he also play pro basketball? Well, yes but Maui admitted that he is a demigod which would surely disqualify him from competition. Having demigods play professionally would ultimately result in the league and the players’ union restructuring their collective bargaining agreement, so that may take a while.</p>
<p>For full disclosure, Moana might not actually be 7’6. Chalk this up to Google’s algorithm fetching information from a popular blog and placing it directly up top its search results. It’s just like when this site accidentally renamed the NC Dinos mascot Swole Daddy. Still, it’s fun to speculate how a 7’6 Moana could fare on the basketball court.

<h3 id="iconic-retailer-watumulls-to-close-ala-moana-shop">&ldquo;Iconic retailer Watumull’s to close Ala Moana shop&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/web1_CTY-Watumull-0401.jpg" alt="img">
Watumull’s — one of Oahu’s iconic retailers for visitor-oriented aloha attire and one of the original tenants at Ala Moana Center — is scheduled to close June 30 under the uncertainty of the COVID-19 shutdown and what it means for isle tourism.</p>
<p>“We’re sad to have to close,” said President J.D. Watumull, grandson of company founder Jhamandas Watumull, who came to Hawaii in 1914 and founded what the company believes is Hawaii’s first Indian-­owned business.</p>
<p>“It’s tough,” J.D. Watumull said. “We feel bad for our longtime employees and for our customers that returned year after year, mostly visitors. We were selling aloha.”</p>
<p>Watumull’s was one of Ala Moana’s original tenants 60 years ago. The upcoming shutdown means the closure of the company’s 950-square-foot space on the ground floor at Ala Moan’s Center Court and the end of six jobs.</p>
<p>Watumull said the company was unable to reach terms on a new lease at a time when it could not get clear direction from government officials on when to expect a resurgence of tourists to Oahu.</p>
<p>“We’re all being affected, right?” Watumull said.</p>
<p>On its website the company said that some of its 1940s-era aloha shirts are now collector’s items.</p>
<p>Tina Yamaki, president of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii, said Watumull’s represents untold Hawaii businesses that are struggling under COVID-19 uncertainty and what it all means for what had been another record-setting year for isle tourism.</p>
<p>“It’s not only the small local businesses like Watumull’s that are closing,” Yamaki said. “The longer that we don’t have tourists coming in, we’re going to see more businesses failing.”</p>
<p>Watumull’s upcoming closure represents the growing concern across an entire, tour-based economy and beyond, Yamaki said.</p>
<p>“There’s a misconception that it’s small, mom-and-pop businesses that are being affected,” she said. “It’s also the medium-sized businesses, the larger businesses. It doesn’t matter if you’re locally owned, nationally owned or intentionally owned, everyone is being affected.”</p>
<p>But Watumull’s, in particular, catered to a repeat visitor market that faithfully returned specifically for Watamull’s attire aimed at men, women and families, Yamaki said.</p>
<p>“When people come to Hawaii, they want to buy something that represents Hawaii — that’s what Watumull’s did,” Yamaki said. “They had a loyal following.”</p>
<p>For now some businesses are offering kamaaina discounts that cannot keep them afloat indefinitely, Yamaki said.</p>
<p>“Deep discounts aren’t going to last forever,” she said.

The outpouring of sentiment to the impending closure of Watumull’s — an iconic aloha attire retailer and one of Ala Moana Center’s original tenants 60 years ago — is something akin to witnessing your own funeral.</p>
<p>“People are saying nice things,” said President J.D. Watumull, grandson of the company’s founder, Jhamandas Watumull, who came to Hawaii in 1914 and founded what the company believes is Hawaii’s first Indian-­owned business.</p>
<p>At the age of 64, J.D. Watumull now has the gloomy task of shuttering the 950-square-foot business that bears his family’s name at Ala Moana Center’s Center Court on June 30, amid the uncertainty of when Hawaii’s tourism industry will recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“My father worked until he was 95, my grandfather until 101,” Watumull said. “It is bittersweet. It wasn’t an easy decision.”</p>
<p>Over its 60 years, Watumull’s developed a loyal following of returning visitors who continued to buy aloha attire for children, men and women.</p>
<p>Now, with the end less than two weeks away and the impending loss of jobs for six store employees, Watumull’s is offering 50% discounts on the entire store inventory to a new business model that is now mostly reliant on kamaaina customers.</p>
<p>“Fifty percent off everything,” Watumull said. “It’s the whole store. Just get rid of the merchandise and do something nice for people.”</p>
<p>In an advertisement, Watumull’s thanked its customers “for years of good business and good memories.”
