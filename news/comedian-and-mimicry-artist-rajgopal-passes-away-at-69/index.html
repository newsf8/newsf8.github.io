Daijiworld Media Network – Mangaluru (SB)</p>
<p>Mangaluru, Jun 30: Daijiworld TV is all set to host an exclusive musical show for the viewers who are abroad on Friday, July 3 from 8.30pm IST. The show is titled &lsquo;Virtual Concert - Entertainment unlocked&rsquo; with the slogan &lsquo;Daijiworld to the rest of the world&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of guitar, maestro Rajgopal along with well-known singers Ajay Warrior and Sangeetha Balachandran will render their melodious voices in multilingual languages for the people who live in various gulf, western and eastern countries. High profile musicians Deepak Jayasheelan, Rajesh Bhagavath, Roshan Fernandes, Varun Rao, Sumukh and Ashith Pinto will participate in this show with background score.</p>
<p>Mohammed Iqbal, Mohammed Haneef, Srikant Kamath, Ranjan Das, Nayana Rajgopla, Vaishnavi and many other singers will render their voices</p>
<p>Tulunada Manikya fame, cine actor Aravind Bolar and Walter Nandalike, founder, Daijiworld Media Group, will host the show in Tulu and Kannada languages.</p>
<p>The virtual musical extravaganza package consists of 20 Tulu, Kannada, Konkani and Hindi super hit songs, specially picked from yesteryears.</p>
<p>The show is scheduled to commence at the following timings as per different time zones; 8:30 pm (IST), 7:00 pm (Oman, UAE), and 6:00 pm (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait).</p>
<p>Viewers can also watch the virtual concert ONLY ON YouTube which will be streamed live on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC66WtcGSVl0mWsZHMQOUoxg/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC66WtcGSVl0mWsZHMQOUoxg/featured</a>. (No telecast on local TV set-top boxes).</p>
<p>Indian community from Karnataka, specially our own Tulunadu who live abroad are known for their unity and helping hands. But the situation after Covid-19 has made them weak in their connectivity to their homeland. As per the reports published in various media, the NRI community is facing a lot of issues and is going through a very tough time. When they were well secured in their jobs and earning, they generously helped various activities in their native and home town. But the situation has changed now. They need support from the people of their native and home town. This programme will be dedicated all those NRIs to boost their morale and show our unity and strength during this extremely difficult time.</p>
<p>Walter Nandalike, Daijiworld founder said, “At this difficult juncture, our artistes here need some stress busting activity as they are idle since three months without performing live. Many have no livelihood due to total ban on public entertainment shows. If anyone wants to support financially, the amount will go directly to the needy artistes who are in difficulties. The show is an initiative of Rajgopal, top musician from Tulunadu. Also, there have been several requests from NRI friends to organise a virtual show.</p>
<p>For more information on this show, you may contact the following numbers:</p>
<p>Rajgopal: +91 94490 47287 or +91 82174 66588 (Only WhatsApp - Daijiworld)

Discovery, in an initiative to raise awareness about the need for wild-life conservation, has roped in actors Rajkummar Rao and Prakash Raj to provide voice-overs for the documentary Wild Karnataka, which premiered on 5 June, the World Environment Day. Produced by award-winning filmmakers Amoghavarsha JS and Kalyan Varma in collaboration with Karnataka Forest Department, Wild Karnataka focuses on the biodiversity in Karnataka and how it has managed to preserve its forests.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Quint, Prakash Raj says, “The voiceover was a different experience altogether because it was connecting to something I love and celebrate. Wild Karnataka is a fantastic initiative by Discovery. A lot of effort and patience has gone into recording the sounds of the wild. I have always loved nature and it keeps me rooted and reminds me I am not alone on this Earth.</p>
<p>The actor also shares some exciting stories of the wild. “I have seen a leopard being chased by wild dogs”.

<h3 id="the-queens-adversary">&ldquo;The Queen’s adversary&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2019/12/23/w600X390/Pradeepan.jpg" alt="img">
Ashameera Aiyappan By</p>
<p>Express News Service</p>
<p>Queen, the new web series streaming on MX player, has been making news for a lot of things. First, it marks Gautham Vasudev Menon’s OTT debut. It’s also Ramya Krishnan’s first foray into the digital space, with her playing a character that seems loosely inspired by the Late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, J Jayalalithaa. Amid all this, another character has been silently grabbing eyeballs: Pradeepan, one of protagonist Shakti Seshadri’s foes in the series.</p>
<p>Actor Vivek Rajgopal plays Pradeepan with muted sophistication, his menace finding effective outlets in raging glares and his haughty body language. The minimalism was intended, says Vivek. “During those times, even if just two people were seen talking, it attracted eyeballs. People observed a lot more.” This was also one of GVM’s pointers to him. “While shooting the climax, GVM sir told me to understand that everyone was watching me.”</p>
<p>Understanding this made the climax showdown easier to enact, he says. “It was a sequence I was eager to do well in. Even though I got the lines only two days before shoot, I was prepared.” And with GVM as the director, he had to remember to be precise with his lines. “Part of my initial brief was that I would have to say what was on paper. We could not change it to our convenience.” He delivered the lengthy conversation scene in a single take, a shot that was later cut for the series. “I didn’t expect for the take to get approved right away. But everybody was happy. Gautham sir said, ‘Super a pannaan la? Good da. Very nice work da.’ It was also the first time Ramya Krishnan ma’am complimented me,” he says happily.</p>
<p>Vivek was offered the role after Reshma Ghatala, the writer, and Gautham saw his performance in Sarjun’s Echarikkai. “Reshma ma’am had confidence in me, and she just said I could do it,” he says. He was also asked to devise his own look, for both the younger and the older version. This was quite challenging. “Since I had to shoot for both looks simultaneously, without prosthetics, I had to figure out a middle ground. They gave me such liberty that what I had in mind ended up being the actual look.”</p>
<p>Pradeepan, Vivek says, was not modeled after any one person or character. “At various points, she faced different types of resistance. Pradeepan was created out of a compilation of all those, not just from one person.” However, saying the cuss words made him feel uncomfortable, but after the shot, Vivek admits. “Even though I knew it was for the character, I had minor apprehensions of who people might relate that character with,” he explains. “But none of it mattered while I was shooting.”</p>
<p>He laughs when I tell him that I was reminded of Neelambari saying Padayappa, every time Shakti Seshadri stressed on his name, Pradeepan. “I knew there were many seniors around me, but I could not have played the character if I had had any nervousness. I was particular that I be professional. Also, everyone was comfortable to work with.” The only time he was nervous, he says, was when he first shot with GVM. “I don’t know him and hadn’t met him before. He’s a legend and I have always wanted to work with him. And having Kathir sir on the camera&hellip; it was all a dream come true.”
