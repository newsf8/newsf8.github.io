KUALA LUMPUR (March 27): The country is navigating uncharted waters and the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (PRIHATIN) is a timely measure for extraordinary times, said Deloitte Malaysia.</p>
<p>The consultancy’s country tax leader, Sim Kwang Gek, said the allocated RM250 billion is more than three times the RM67 billion allocated for stimulus packages during the 2009 financial crisis.</p>
<p>“This demonstrates the commitment of the government in prioritising the well-being of the rakyat while also ensuring the survival of businesses impacted by COVID-19,” she told Bernama here today.</p>
<p>On a programme to allow employers to defer, restructure or reschedule their mandatory Employees Provident Fund contributions for employees, she said this is expected to generate cash flow savings of RM10 billion.</p>
<p>“This proposal is certainly more palatable (than simply reducing workers’ EPF contribution) and is a welcome move as it alleviates cash flow constraints while also ensuring retirement savings are not significantly impacted,” said Sim.</p>
<p>Touching on the deferment of tax instalment payments for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), she said this proposal would assist them in managing their cash flows.</p>
<p>However, she said, the impact may not be significant as affected businesses are now allowed to revise their estimates of tax payable earlier.</p>
<p>For instance, in the third month of instalment and with this facility, most businesses would have revised their tax estimates downwards, she explained.</p>
<p>On the deferment and waiver of rental expenses initiative, Sim said this would ease the financial burden faced by families especially those in bottom 40 percent household income (B40) and middle 40 percent household income (M40) groups.</p>
<p>“The proposal to waive six months’ rental on properties owned by the Government is also a welcome move but more can be done to alleviate cash flow challenges faced by businesses,” she said.</p>
<p>A form of rental subsidy or rebate to businesses should be considered as rental cost is a significant part of their operating expenditure, she said.

<p>KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — Lower income (B40) and middle-income (M40) families are set to receive cash handouts totalling RM10 billion in the recently announced People-Centric Economic Stimulus package (Prihatin) by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin today.</p>
<p>For four million households that are earning less than RM4,000 a month, RM1,600 will be made available to them in two tranches, with RM1,000 being paid in the month of April and RM600 in the following month of May</p>
<p>For some 1.1 million households earning RM4,000 to RM,800, a cash handout of RM1,000 will be made available to them, with RM500 being transferred in April and May respectively.</p>
<p>RM800 will be made available to some three million unmarried individuals, above the age of 21, who earn less than RM2,000 a month, with RM500 to be paid in April and the rest in May.</p>
<p>Those earning more than RM2,000 monthly will receive RM500 and the payment will be split equally between the months of April and May.</p>
<p>In the package, some RM270 million has been allocated to tertiary students who will receive a RM200 one-off payment in May.</p>
<p>An additional RM25 million has been allocated to vulnerable groups such as the disabled, elderly, homeless and children in shelters.</p>
<p>Muhyiddin also announced that the RM3.7 billion for the Bantuan Sara Hidup (BSH) programme, which is ongoing, will be paid in July.</p>
<p>Prior to the announcement, the government have already agreed to impose a six month moratorium on National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) borrowers’ loan repayment, involving some RM750 million.</p>
<p>Today, the government decided to extend the same for Skills Development Fund Corporation (PTPK) loan borrowers, starting April 1. This move will benefit some 174,500 people.</p>
<p>The government also entitled mySalam insurance holders that are hospitalised due to Covid-19 to be able to claim RM50 a day, up to 14 days as an income substitute.</p>
<p>The government also extended this benefit to those in the B40 households that have been quarantined as Patients Under Investigation (PUI)

<p><img src="https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/pahangecoNA_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1585304635.jpg" alt="img">
