<p>Bassnectar took to his social media channels to announce that he’s taking a step back from his career and distancing himself from Be Interactive.</p>
<p>The new decade has truly marked itself as a turning point for the entire dance music scene. While the earliest days centered around the scene’s response to the loss of live shows and festivals in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the past month has stories of sexual assault and abuse circulate about artists like Space Jesus, graves, Aerochord, and Bassnectar.</p>
<p>Bassnectar’s name was one that had been brought up back in 2018 during the allegations made against Datsik, and many of the same pieces of evidence that were used then resurfaced in June. Initially remaining quiet, he responded with a post in his Facebook Group before making a public statement on the matter earlier this week. While claiming that the accusations were untrue, he also went on to discuss positions of power and the responsibility of people to hold themselves accountable.</p>
<p>“And if you are a man in a position of power, I want to encourage you to take an honest look at yourself, be open to learning from your mistakes, and how you can take accountability for them: there are many resources out there for you to improve yourself,” read the statement. Now, days after posting that response, he’s taken to social media to announce he’s taking a step back from his career and position of power and privilege.</p>
<p>In his recent statement, Bassnectar echoes the prior by saying that the accusations aren’t true and that he feels sorry for any harm he has caused in the past. “I feel intense compassion for anyone I may have hurt. I truly hope you allow me a chance to work together toward healing. The rumors you are hearing are untrue, but I realize some of my past actions have caused pain, and I am deeply sorry.”</p>
<p>Additionally, he went on to take an even further step back from Be Interactive, the non-profit focused on getting others involved and engaged in their community to make a personal impact. He will be handing off the reins of the non-profit to a team and will not be involved further.</p>

<p><img src="https://liveforlivemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-7.45.52-PM-1200x630.png" alt="img">
Lorin Ashton, better known as Bassnectar, has announced that he is “stepping back” from his career and his non-profit organization, Be Interactive, in the wake of allegations that he habitually acted in an inappropriate sexual manner toward underage fans.</p>
<p>The recent surge in allegations against Bassnectar, the popular electronic bass music producer and DJ, can be traced to the @evidenceagainstbassnectar Instagram account that made its first post on Sunday, June 28th. The page has been extremely active in the five days since, posting screenshots detailing instances of Ashton’s alleged improper behavior toward minors, some of which are dated as far back as 2015. The account has made more than 50 posts offering evidence of Ashton’s alleged misconduct and gained nearly 7,000 followers as of publication time.</p>
<p>In a post on Friday on the Bassnectar social media channels, Aston noted, “I am stepping back from my career and I am stepping down from my position of power and privilege in this community because I want to take responsibility and accountability. I feel intense compassion for anyone I may have hurt. I truly hope you allow me a chance to work together toward healing. The rumors you are hearing are untrue, but I realize some of my past actions have caused pain, and I am deeply sorry. I am handing off our nonprofit Be Interactive to a diverse team to continue without my involvement moving forward. Sometime in the future I may share more thoughts on these matters, but for now, please take care of each other and I wish you all the brightest future.”</p>

<p>In a previous post on Tuesday, Ashton offered a more general acknowledgment of the allegations in a long message in which he concluded that he would spend his summer “examining my privilege and opening my communication to people from my past with whom I had an intimate relationship. What I am most open to is healing. I want to encourage anyone anywhere who feels alone or helpless: we want to be a bridge to support and therapy.”</p>
<p>This story is developing.

<p><img src="https://edm.com/.image/t_share/MTcyNzMzNTYwMTkxNDYxMDUw/bassnectar.jpg" alt="img">
Following allegations of sexual misconduct that were shared on social media, Bassnectar has responded.</p>
<p>After an Instagram account called @evidenceagainstbassnectar started to gain traction online, the DJ and producer issued a statement to refute the alleged sexual misconduct. According to a report by Your EDM, Bassnectar posted a lengthy reply in a private Facebook fan group, which was distilled into a series of screenshots and circulated on social media. &ldquo;The rumors of sexual misconduct that are circulating about me are completely untrue. I want to leave it at that, because it truly is that simple,&rdquo; Bassnectar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been involved in anything that was not absolutely, unequivocally consensual. During a time when high profile men are being called out for their violence against women, I am proud to be an ally of women and stand in solidarity with victims. Thank you to all those who are listening to real victims of abuse and standing to support women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can read his full statement in the screenshots below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my 20s and 30s I was traveling constantly, and never felt like I had a permanent home. Most of the women I met were younger than me and in college, which at the time this did not seem strange or wrong or creepy,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;We had a lot of fun together, and in most cases we shared a beautiful connection or lasting friendship. Looking back now, I simply wish I had never opened up to anyone I met on the road, because any relationship in that context had the potential to get complicated, misconstrued, or cause unintentional emotional harm to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassnectar also wrote that his team will be &ldquo;offering a free therapy session specifically for anyone who feels like they need support and don&rsquo;t know how to get it.&rdquo; He also encouraged &ldquo;anyone who needs this support&rdquo; to reach out via email over the course of the next month, where only the women on his team will read and reply. According to Bassnectar, those women will &ldquo;link you with a therapist to discuss your story of abuse and perhaps also to build aa long term plan for how you want to address it with friends or family or loved ones - or whatever you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubling down on his therapy-related course of action, Bassnectar published a follow-up statement on social media today, June 30th, 2020. &ldquo;In response to the positive feedback in support of therapy for victims of sexual misconduct, we are offering scholarships for therapy via To Write Love On Her Arms (TWLOHA),&rdquo; he wrote before including an application link.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to encourage anyone in our community to reach out for guidance or support - regardless of gender or sexual preference,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;And if you are a man in a position of power, I want to encourage you to take an honest look at yourself, be open to learning from your mistakes, and how you can take accountability for them: there are many resources out there for you to improve yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://livemusicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Bassnectar-3616.jpg" alt="img">
Bassnectar just shared a note on his socials detailing out that he is “stepping back from my career” following reports that surfaced earlier this week that he has engaged in inappropriate conduct with women he’s met on the road.</p>
<p>Whereas the initial response to the reports had the artist offering up resources for therapy for women that may have been harmed, this is a more formal announcement acknowledging that he may have inadvertently had more of a hand in speficially causing pain along the way, even though the note says that the “rumors you are hearing are untrue.” And he may be back, but for now, he’s simply wishing everyone all the brightest future and he’s out.</p>
<p>Crazy times.</p>

UPDATE: Bassnectar says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;stepping back from&rdquo; his career after the sexual misconduct &ldquo;rumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassnectar has responded to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct that have surfaced against him on social media, Your EDM reports. He appears to have issued a statement in a private Facebook fan group, and screenshots of his statement have been circulating on Twitter. His statement begins:</p>
<p>The rumors of sexual misconduct that are circulating about me are completely untrue. I want to leave it at that, because it truly is that simple. I have never been involved in anything that was not absolutely, unequivocally consensual. During a time when high profile men are being called out for their violence against women, I am proud to be an ally of women and stand in solidarity with victims. Thank you to all those who are listening to real victims of abuse and standing to support women.</p>
<p>He later adds, &ldquo;I have learned to recognize that just because I have have never intentionally harmed a woman, there are ways that I could cause unintentional harm and I want to take responsibility for that.</p>
<p>He then writes:</p>
<p>In my 20s and 30s I was traveling constantly, and never felt like I had a permanent home. Most of the women I met were younger than me and in college, which at the time this did not seem strange or wrong or creepy. We had a lot of fun together, and in most cases we shared a beautiful connection or lasting friendship. Looking back now, I simply wish I had never opened up to anyone I met on the road, because any relationship in that context had the potential to get complicated, misconstrued, or cause unintentional emotional harm to others.</p>
<p>He then adds, &ldquo;If there are any previous partners who feel slighted or harbor regret, I am completely available for discussion, learning, and potential healing or to help connect you with others for support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also says that his team will be &ldquo;offering a free therapy session specifically for anyone who feels like they need support and don&rsquo;t know how to get it. For the next month, anyone who needs this support [even if you have a friend who needs the support and you want to do this on their behalf] we encourage you to reach out to <a href="mailto:empowerment@bassnectar.net">empowerment@bassnectar.net</a> where only the women on our team will read and reply. She will help link you with a therapist to discuss your story of abuse and perhaps also to build aa long term plan for how you want to address it with friends or family or loved ones - or whatever you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassnectar also adds that he chose to post this in a private fan group &ldquo;because this is the core of the community: we respect you immensely. We know you wanted to hear about what was going on, and we have gone to great lengths to avoid calling anyone out.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="電音每週報鮮肉轉大人法國edm男神kungs全新主打dopamine滿載快樂正能量">&ldquo;【電音每週報】鮮肉轉大人！法國EDM男神Kungs全新主打〈Dopamine〉滿載快樂正能量&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.kfs.io/article5/global/21,9406,2v1/original.jpg" alt="img">
本名Valentin Brunel的Kungs來自法國，今年23歲的他在2016年以〈The Girl〉一曲竄紅。他的初期音樂風格以Tropical House見長，近兩年逐漸轉向Deep House，創作題材也隨著他的成長日趨成熟。本週他向過去的自我拉回一點點，推出帶有Tropical House色彩的流行電音作品〈Dopamine〉。在這首歌的封面上他穿著上班族西裝，與他近期轉大人的形象相稱，也呼應歌詞中上班族為工作拼博忙碌但愉快的心情。</p>
<p>本週大體上是各類型強度平衡的一週，每個類型都有幾首不錯的作品。譬如擅長Dubstep與Bass House暴力聲響的Jauz本週跨出舒適圈，推出旋律優美的Melodic Dubstep作品〈Wildlife〉。以〈Rabbit Hole〉成功由Tech House切換至Melodic House跑道後，CamelPhat推出乘勝追擊之作〈Hypercolour〉。Seeb、RetroVision、Elderbrook與Timmy Trumpet等人的新作也很值得推薦。</p>
<p>相對於單曲來說，本週的專輯更是值得一提，有兩張專輯分別來自類型中一線藝人。來自DnB場景的Bassnectar由於堅持Punk精神，且玩轉各類Bass樂風，他的Dubstep被樂迷公認為最過癮的作品。本週他推出了新專輯《All Colors》，再次以瘋狂的低音線衝擊大家的耳朵。HONNE曾在2017擠爆The Wall，2019來台還熱情加場，他們本週推出了第三張創作大碟《No Song Without You》。這依舊是一張恬淡清雅的靈魂電子秀逸之作，請搭配通寧冰咖啡在夏日午後服用。</p>

<h3 id="bassnectar-makes-statement-on-sexual-abuse-allegations">&ldquo;Bassnectar Makes Statement On Sexual Abuse Allegations&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bassnectar_rukes.jpg" alt="img">
UPDATE 7/3 | Bassnectar has released another statement that he is “stepping back” from his career. Read the full statement here.</p>
<p>In the past month, graves, Aero Chord, Space Jesus, and others have been called out on social media for their past allegedly abusing women, ranging from sexual harassment to downright rape. It’s been a watershed moment for the dance music community, one some people has felt was long overdue. In the midst of all these, Bassnectar has been brought up in discussions repeatedly. Though some accused him of nefarious acts, the accusations were always a bit more nebulous and never seemed to have a direct source.</p>
<p>Now, after some time, Bassnectar has responded to those accusations in a private Facebook fan group:</p>
<p>The rumors of sexual misconduct that are circulating about me are completely untrue. I want to leave it at that, because it truly is that simple. I have never been involved in anything that was not absolutely, unequivocally consensual. During a time when high profile men are being called out for their violence against women, I am proud to be an ally of women and stand in solidarity with victims. Thank you to all those who are listening to real victims of abuse and standing to support women.</p>
<p>This concept of “real victims” is repeated a couple times throughout his statement in an effort to drive home his claim that the accusations against him are false. However, he admits later on, through conversations with “close female friends and family members,” that even though he “never intentionally harmed a woman, there are ways that I could cause unintentional harm and I want to take responsibility for that.”</p>
<p>What those ways specifically are is never expounded upon.</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<p>In my 20s and 30s I was traveling constantly, and never felt like I had a permanent home. Most of the women I met were younger than me and in college, which at the time this did not seem strange or wrong or creepy. We had a lot of fun together, and in most cases we shared a beautiful connection or lasting friendship. Looking back now, I simply wish I had never opened up to anyone I met on the road, because any relationship in that context had the potential to get complicated, misconstrued, or cause unintentional emotional harm to others.</p>
<p>Bassnectar, in support of victims, is offering free therapy sessions for “anyone who feels like they need support and don’t know how to get it.” For the next month, anyone can email [email protected] where they will be connected only with women from Bassnectar’s team who will link them with a therapist to address their issues however they see fit.</p>
<p>He concludes his statement, “If you are a real victim of real sexual violence, we support you 100% and stand with you. If you are attempting to hijack the movement of supporting victims by promoting false accusations you are disrespecting women and causing more pain. If you see anyone spreading misinformation or disinformation online, it amy be best to not even engage.”</p>
<p>You can read Bassnectar’s full statement, including why it was only posted in this private group, below.</p>
