A Million Little Things Season 3 could potentially be a game-changer if it returns. The Season 2 finale, aptly titled ‘Til Death Do Us Part,’ resolved a few threads, but it built even more interest with some brand-new challenges the core group must eventually confront. The story revolved around the vow renewal ceremony that Eddie and Katherine had planned, as well as other less cheery life and death themes.</p>
<p>Within the hour-long episode, several life-altering events occurred, but the full repercussions of said events will not be seen until much later. With many factors up in the air, anything is possible. Still, the show’s creator, DJ Nash, dropped a few hints to Deadline about what fans can expect if ABC does indeed renew the series.</p>

<p>How did ‘A Million Little Things’ Season 2 end?</p>
<p>Eddie and Katherine were on the road to happily ever after until his estranged sister, Lindsay, popped back into their lives with dusty old family baggage. When they were youngsters, Eddie’s sweetheart, Alex, drowned in a lake, but in his drunken state, he had no recollection of the incident. Lindsay brought the tragic events back to the forefront of Eddie’s mind, and he deduced that Alex’s death was his fault.</p>
<p>At rock bottom, Ed was tempted to drink but resisted the urge. He decided to hightail it back to Katherine but was struck by a vehicle on his way home. Nash remains mum about the musician’s fate, but he did tell Deadline that viewers have seen the driver before.</p>
<p>It is anyone’s guess who mowed down Eddie, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the driver is connected closely to the core group of players. Aside from Eddie’s accident, the rest of the friends will have plenty of other drama to untangle in A Million Little Things Season 3, assuming the show will be renewed.</p>
<p>Rome and Regina must deal with the emotional fallout from losing their child to the wavering birth mother, Eve. In other news, Delilah must learn to navigate her new status of dating while mothering, and Maggie, Gary, and Darcy will need to continue the delicate balance of their love triangle. But with Maggie at Oxford, does that mean she’s out for good?</p>
<p>Will ‘A Million Little Things’ Season 3 happen?</p>
<p>Coming off of an intense Season 2 finale, the million-dollar question is: Will A Million Little Things return in the 2020-2021 broadcast season? Deadline reported that the show is still awaiting a season order, but there may be hope. The outlet quoted Nash as saying,</p>
<p>“I will tell you that the studio and the network have been so supportive of this show right from the beginning. They have let me and let us tell the stories exactly the way we want to tell them; they’ve just really been incredible partners. I had an alt ending for the show, and I was told to go with this one.”</p>
<p>With any luck, ABC will order A Million Little Things Season 3 so that fans will not be left hanging with burning questions ignited in the Season 2 finale.</p>

<h3 id="tv-ratings-million-things-deputy-and-legacies-steady-with-finales-svu-up">TV Ratings: Million Things, Deputy and Legacies Steady With Finales; SVU Up</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/a-million-little-things-season-2-finale-abc.jpg?w=620" alt="img">
In the latest TV ratings, A Million Little Things closed out its sophomore season with 4.34 million total viewers and a 0.7 rating, ticking up to its largest audience since its fall finale while steady in the demo. TVLine readers gave the Season 2 finale an average grade of “A-” (read post mortems with EP and that cast member).</p>
<p>Opening ABC’s night, Station 19 (7.3 mil/1.2, read recap) and Grey’s Anatomy (6.5 mil/1.3, read recap and post mortem) both dipped in the demo from last week’s season highs.</p>
<p>Elsewhere….</p>
<p>FOX | Last Man Standing (4.5 mil/0.8) ticked down, while Outmatched (2.6 mil/0.6, Season 1 reader grade “B+”) and Deputy (3.9 mil/0.6) were steady with their freshman finales.</p>
<p>THE CW | Katy Keene (549K/0.1) and the Legacies “spring finale” (626K/0.2, TVLine reader grade “B+”) were steady in the demo.</p>
<p>NBC | Superstore (3.64 mil/0.9) and Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2.3 mil/0.7) were steady in the demo, with the former hitting a season high in audience. A pair of Indebteds did 1.6 mil/0.4 and then 1.5 mil/0.3, with the latter tying a series low. SVU returned from a month-long break to 3.8 mil (its largest audience since its fall finale) and a 0.8, matching its best rating since the season opener.</p>
<p>The Live+Same Day numbers reported in our daily-ish ratings column do not reflect a show’s overall performance, given the increases in delayed playback via DVR and streaming platforms. These Live+Same Day numbers instead are used to illustrate any trends or high/low superlatives. Happy Fun Ball may stick to certain types of skin.</p>
