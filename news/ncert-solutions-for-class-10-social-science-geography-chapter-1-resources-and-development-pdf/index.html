<li>Answer the following questions in about 120 words.</li>
</ol>
<p>(i) Explain the land use pattern in India and why has the land under forest not increased much since 1960-61?</p>
<p>(ii) How have technical and economic development led to more consumption of resources?</p>
<p>Answer.</p>
<p>(i) In India, the land is primarily used for agriculture, grazing and other activities like housing, construction of roads and industries. Some part of it is covered with forests and deserts. The pattern of the net sown area varies from one state to another state depending upon the climate and soil types. For example, about 80 percent of the total area in Punjab and Haryana is used for cultivation while in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman Nicobar Islands, it is even less than 10 percent. The part of the land which is covered by forests in India is about 22%.</p>
<p>The land under the forest has not increased since 1960–61 due to the increased use of land for agricultural activities, industrialisation and urbanisation. Increasing population and subsequent increase in demand for resources resulted in the degradation of forests. The land under forest has increased by only about 4% since 1960-61.</p>
<p>(ii) The following factors are responsible for technical and economic development leading to increased consumption of resources:</p>
<p>Technological development led to efficient machinery. As a result, production increased ultimately leading to the consumption of more resources.</p>
<p>Economic development raised people&rsquo;s demands and the technological advancement led to greater exploitation of resources to meet their demands.</p>
<p>Improved medical and health resources led to increased population which in turn resulted in increased consumption of resources.</p>

<p>World Environment Day 2020: Year after year, India has seen that the air quality in a lot of metropolitan cities is deteriorating at a rapid rate, with Delhi and Mumbai often featuring among the most polluted cities in the world. This has been a major cause of concern among the authorities, the activists as well as the people. However, during the coronavirus pandemic, the world also saw a ray of hope of environmental healing when the news of the closing of a huge hole in the Ozone layer over the Arctic surfaced. It was being touted by people as the nature healing itself due to non-interference of humans. But then, a cyclone struck Mumbai after nearly 130 years, and the dramatically different incidents have left people confused over whether nature is healing or not.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with Financial Express Online, Professor SK Satheesh from Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), and an Infosys Prize winner, answered this question. He said, “Incidentally, both these events happened during lock-down period. But both these events are not related to lock-down. The closing of the ozone hole has nothing to do with the reduced emissions during the lock-down. This happened because of the unusual atmospheric conditions associated with polar vortex, which bring cold air to polar regions.”</p>
<p>About Cyclone Nisarga making a landfall in Mumbai, the professor said, “A cyclone hitting Mumbai was not unexpected. It is true that Mumbai has not faced a cyclone in recent past. This is because of the weather dynamics of the Arabian Sea. On average, the Arabian Sea witnesses one or two cyclones every year which is fewer in number compared to those in the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones formed over the Arabian Sea tend to move westward towards Yemen and Somalia. However, the impact of hurricane Sandy that hit New York City warned us about the prospect of such an event taking place in Mumbai. Because, most of the cyclones that form in the Atlantic Ocean move north and later eastward and hence do not hit New York City. The hurricane Sandy was an exception and hit northeast United States on 29 October 2012 and became one of the most destructive storms in history.”</p>
<p>“Similarly, most of the cyclones in the Arabian Sea move westward and hence their chance of hitting Mumbai is usually considered low. There is no record of a cyclone landfall near Mumbai during the past 130 years. We should remember that two of the cyclones in the Arabian Sea turned eastward and hit the coast of Gujarat, a few degrees north of Mumbai and hence we believed that chances of a cyclone hitting the city of Mumbai cannot be ruled out. Thus, such events are due to climate change, evolving over time, and not because of any short-term effects,” he added.</p>
<p>But the healing of ozone was not the only incident we witnessed during the coronavirus lockdown. The entire world also witnessed several environmental changes, like rivers becoming cleaner and animals resurfacing at their old habitats. Were those also by chance? Professor Satheesh does not think so.</p>
<p>He said, “The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in improved air quality and water quality in rivers and lakes. The lockdown experience demonstrated that nature heals itself in a short period.“</p>
<p>However, now that the lockdown is lifting, things are getting more worrisome. He added, “It has been reported that after partial lifting of the lockdown itself, some of these positive effects started disappearing. Since we cannot continue the lockdown for longer periods, we do not have the option to leave nature to heal itself.”</p>
<p>The lockdown, while having a positive result on the environment, has damaged the economies around the world. And so, we are again faced with the question of balancing out the economic activities with preservation of nature. This is also the agenda for the World Economic Forum 2021, which highlights the importance of taking steps in this direction.</p>
<p>Putting forth his suggestions, Professor Satheesh said, “It is true that the dramatic economic slowdown since March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in some positive environmental outcomes. But it has come at a great cost in terms of human lives and jobs lost. In my opinion, reducing economic growth is not the pathway to achieve climate goals. In India, we still have large numbers of people below the poverty line, continued economic growth and development are critical. Moreover, India has the constraints of democracy. Climate goals have to be achieved by sustainable growth and conscious mitigation efforts such as energy decarbonization, reforestation, improved and well-planned land use and so on, besides adequate planning for climate adaptation. It is possible to create better models for sustainable development that balances profit and biodiversity by assigning appropriate monetary value for the ecosystem and the services they provide for the economy.”</p>
<p>However, the cause of worry does not end there. If things go back to normal, the air quality might also deteriorate again. The national capital of Delhi, while having a green cover of 21.9%, which is above the 20% threshold set by the authorities, still counts among the most polluted cities.</p>
<p>Professor Satheesh, however, said that green cover directly has no impact on air pollution. “Air quality degradation is an issue of major concern in India. This is mainly attributed to increase in population density, rapid economic growth, unplanned urbanization and industrial growth. Green cover has no direct relation to air pollution, which is caused due to anthropogenic activities. The pollution levels in Delhi have been increasing. Dust-generating construction sites, industrial emissions as well as a dominance of coal-fired power plants all contribute to the air quality degradation. The number of vehicles running on diesel has increased. All these contributed to increased levels of air pollution in Delhi,” he said.</p>
<p>Another major cause of air pollution in Delhi, as per experts, is the mass stubble burning, especially in Punjab and Haryana. Professor Satheesh, who has studied the impact of soot from domestic burning, cooking and transport, explained the impact of stubble burning in India.</p>
<p>“Crop-residue burning over regions west of Delhi, i.e, Punjab and Haryana significantly impacts Air Quality in the Ganges Valley including Delhi. Every year during winter, farmers in the states of Punjab and Haryana burn the crop residue left from rice harvesting in order to clear and prepare land for the next crop. The results are adverse in terms of the particulate pollutants as well as gaseous pollutants emitted by these fires. Atmospheric temperature inversion, which prevents vertical movement of air, during winter compliments this situation. In the absence of vertical dilution, air pollution near-surface will become more serious,” he explained.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, he said, the problem of air pollution in Delhi is a combined effect of stubble burning over regions west of Delhi, local pollution from industries/vehicular emissions and peculiar atmospheric conditions during winter. “Adding to the complexity, the presence of Himalayas and highlands on the other side prevents dilution of pollutants,” he added.</p>
<p>Speaking about the impact of stubble burning in the remaining parts of India, the professor said, “Stubble burning is not the major cause of air pollution in other regions. Over the Indian subcontinent, fossil fuel burning emissions are dominant, especially in cities. These emissions are mainly from vehicles. The number of registered motor vehicles in the country was just 2 million in 1970, increased to 12 million in 1990, 65 million in 2005, 115 million in 2010 and more than 200 million at present. This exponential increase in the number of vehicles (a major fraction using diesel) is the reason for air quality degradation in Indian cities. In rural areas, stubble burning is the dominant source.”</p>
<p>Proposing his solution to the problem of poor air quality, he said, “Transition to electric vehicles is the best option to reduce air quality degradation from vehicular emissions. In order to encourage more people to use electric vehicles, we need more charging stations. The COVID-19 lockdown and subsequent reduction of oil prices, poses a challenge for the transition to electric vehicles.”</p>
<p>But it is not as easy as it seems. India is a vast country, where different parts of the country experience different environmental challenges due to geographical diversity. This means that the challenges faced by these states at the micro level vary, and it makes a macro-level environmental policy that much more difficult. But an environmental policy is the need of the hour and a solution to these problems is imperative.</p>
<p>Professor Satheesh also stated that the consequences of climate change vary from region to region. “India assumes special significance due to the diverse geographical features, high population density, rapid urbanization and industrialization and resulting highly complex climate system. This region is also characterised as most heterogeneous with complex terrains. The impact depends on various factors including geographic and socio-economic conditions,” he said.</p>
<p>Further explaining, he said, “Research on climate change provides a scientific basis for governments at all levels to develop climate related policies. For example, the low-carbon transition has environmental ‘co-benefits’, which include improvement in air quality, biodiversity conservation and supporting the preservation of forests. A recent study at our centre has demonstrated that decarbonization of Indian power sector could significantly reduce emissions and health risks, but pollution control could be far more effective. It is equally important that scientific research on climate science also pay attention to local and regional problems and sensitize policymakers at the national, state and district levels about the consequences of projected impacts. This would help policy makers at all levels in their long-term planning. This calls for supporting targeted climate research relevant to specific regions and the outcome should be solution-oriented. When scientific research addresses problems at a disaggregated level, chances are better to engage with a broad spectrum of policymakers.”</p>
<p>While experts can guide the government in forming the policy, sensitisation and awareness among the masses is also important. People are now being informed about the need for preserving the environment, but the true result would only be seen once this has been made a second nature to humans. For that, it is important that children, from a young age, are taught about this.</p>
<p>“The main problem here is the fact that our students are not aware about the environment until they reach master’s degree courses. This would require educational policy reforms, which would take time to implement. Therefore, it is important to initiate awareness programmes among students from high school itself. Such programmes can include a series of lectures on climate change and the environment including related topical issues such as air quality and health issues, various issues related to the environment and demonstration of methods for the measurement of climate-relevant atmospheric properties. Maybe also activities like climate science quiz contests to make it interesting while also checking their grasp on the concept. While there are a number of books available, most of them are meant for bachelors or master’s degree students,” he said.</p>
<p>A holistic approach towards climate conservation and environmental preservation is what is needed at this point, in which all the stakeholders, including the government, the industries and the people would have to work together to reverse the negative impact of human activities. For that, it is important that scientific research in this regard is given due importance and the upcoming generation is taught from the beginning the need to keep the environment clean and safe.

<h3 id="land-degradation-target-can-be-met-by-utilising-100-day-work-scheme--analysis">&ldquo;Land degradation target can be met by utilising 100-day work scheme | Analysis&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/08/29/Pictures/_d1695676-ca24-11e9-80e5-a7e5951f3eba.png" alt="img">
india</p>
<p>Updated: Aug 29, 2019 11:50 IST</p>
<p>Environment minister, Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday announced that India will convert nearly 50 lakh hectares of degraded land to fertile land in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>He also said that the government will implement the “New Delhi Declaration” on tackling land degradation which is to be adopted at the end of the negotiations under United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought hosted by India in September.</p>
<p>Javadekar however didn’t elaborate on how the big target will be achieved. A desertification and land degradation Atlas by Space Applications Centre showed that 29.32% of total geographical area during 2011-13 was undergoing land degradation. Globally, one-third of the total geographical area is degraded.</p>
<p>Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Delhi, Gujarat and Goa have more than 50% of land area undergoing desertification/land degradation while states with less than 10% land degradation are Kerala, Assam, Mizoram, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>The best bet for the environment ministry is to utilise the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) — the world’s largest wage-based social protection programme which is currently employing about 260 million people.</p>
<p>According to the environment ministry, the main causes of land degradation in India are soil and wind erosion, deforestation, poor irrigation and fertilizer application practices. Such a target would require a very large number of people working in degraded lands improving soil parameters overtime.</p>
<p>MGNREGA’s natural resource management (NRM) works which include raising plantations, restoring and making farm ponds, groundwater recharge structures, watershed management among others do just that.</p>
<p>HT visited some large and successful NRM projects in dry areas of Chhattisgarh in July. A large earthen dam built by villagers in Kokdakhar, a village in Chhattisgarh’s Kabirdhan district (a rain shadow area), where farmers are bracing for their crops to fail for the second year in a row is worth studying.</p>
<p>The earthen dam has managed to bring up groundwater levels and helped tide over the drinking and domestic water use crisis. In many villagers, locals are growing lentils on the bunds of farm ponds they have dug up and farming fish which is improving soil quality and providing livelihood. Similar case studies are abounding in Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Odisha and others.</p>
<p>The Rural Development ministry’s master circular for 2018-19 also recognizes the importance of the 100-day scheme in tackling impacts of climate change. “NREGS works address the climate change vulnerability and protect the farmers from such risks and conserve natural resources,” it states.</p>
<p>The environment ministry can tap in to the resources and expertise of the Rural Development ministry to ensure the land degradation target is met. An additional benefit of collaborating will be to offer jobs to states where job demand is high during times of rural distress. Some officials in the environment ministry said they do plan to involve the rural development ministry.

<h3 id="falling-groundwater-levels-driving-farmers-in-punjab-to-move-away-from-paddy">&ldquo;Falling groundwater levels driving farmers in Punjab to move away from paddy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-71341903,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-380314,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg" alt="img">
The humble maize is the new calling for Gurmail Singh, who had been cultivating paddy for the past three decades. A decline in the yield from paddy has necessitated the shift away from the traditional crop. Paddy is seen as a water-guzzling crop, and the water being fetched by a submergible pump from an existing tube well in his field has been falling by every passing season.With the groundwater level around his village of Bhathadua in Punjab’s Ludhiana district declining rapidly, and since deepening the tube well and investing in a more powerful pump would need to him to borrow more, Singh looked for options other than paddy. Maize fit the bill.Singh is one among an increasing number of farmers in Punjab who are taking up cultivation of crops such as cotton, maize and basmati that aren’t as much water dependant as paddy.“Groundwater has depleted too deep around the village to grow paddy, and another crop loss would push my family deep into debt,” said the 48-year-old, who is farming on four acres of leased land in addition to three acres he owns.“Maize required just two rounds of irrigation as rains were adequate this year, unlike in paddy where 10-20 times more water is required,” he said.It is still an experiment and the success of it depends on the yield and remuneration they get. But farmers of the ilk of Singh have already started contributing in another way to a larger cause.This season, farmers in Punjab have sown 3 lakh hectares less of paddy. That means, they saved water enough to meet an entire month’s consumption in the whole country, said Sutantar Kumar Airi, the director of agriculture in the state.To produce a kilogram of rice, 2,500-5,500 litres of water is needed, as per the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.This insatiable need for irrigating paddy crops is believed to have contributed to the depletion of groundwater in 80% of Punjab, according to the state agriculture department.In several pockets in the districts of Mansa, Sangrur, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Moga, Pathankot and Patiala, groundwater has gone very deep. “The groundwater that was around 10 metres deep before the Green Revolution has depleted to 40-50 meters in central Punjab and paddy growing districts,” a senior official at Central Ground Water Board said.Paddy farmers in Punjab account for 11-12 million tonnes of rice annually, or more than a tenth of India’s output of the staple grain.The northern state, along with neighbouring Haryana, is also among the largest producers of wheat. While the winter crop of wheat doesn’t need so much of water, and hasn’t seen any fall in acreage, farmers are abandoning paddy and planting other crops.In the ongoing kharif season, cotton is planted on 1.4 lakh hectares more than the last season in Punjab, additional chief sectary Vishwajeet Khanna said. The acreage of maize has increased by 60,000 hectares and basmati by 1.2 lakh hectares.Will this be sustainable? That depends on a good harvest and remunerative price, say government officials and agriculture experts. For this year, the results will soon be out, as harvesting starts next month.“Surely crops like cotton, maize and even basmati consume substantially less amount of water than paddy. But we need to find ways to keep it profitable for the farmers,” Khanna said.Government assistance, he acknowledged, was a must at this stage to encourage farmers to diversify.The state government is taking steps to support farmers as they shift to new crops, said Khanna.The ongoing thought process within the Punjab government is to bring in a price-deficiency support scheme to supplement farmers’ income, he said.So far, there has been no serious incentive scheme to promote crop diversification. But a Nabard programme that provides compensation of up to Rs 23,000 per hectare has facilitated few hundred farmers to try new crops.Officials said they were providing training and technical support to farmers who wanted to diversify.“We are exhorting farmers to grow alternative crops by recommending suitable hybrids, fertilisers and other inputs to ensure optimal yields,” chief agriculture officer Baldev Singh said. Ahead of each sowing period, training modules on cultivating alternative crops and seminars by experts on best agricultural practices are being conducted, he said.Rice is the staple food for more than half the world’s population and is the main cereal in most states in India.In the 1960s and 1970s India had given special focus to expand the acreage and yield of paddy, or unhusked rice, through the Green Revolution, to make the country self-sufficient in food grains. But now, paddy is being blamed for contributing to a major worry that the humankind is staring at — water scarcity It is high time to move away from paddy and opt for less water-consuming crops like oil seeds and pulses, Central University of Punjab chancellor and agriculture economist SS Johal said. “Water exploitation is fast turning Punjab into a desert and it is not at all in the interest of the country as Punjab is the largest provider of food grains for national food security,” he said.Johal sees the availability of free water to farmers as the main hurdle in promoting diversification from water-guzzling paddy.“Cost-free water needs to go as farmers are in illusion that it is providing them financial benefit. In fact, governments are keeping farmers in illusion and this benefit is actually passed on to the consumers across India in the form of rice and farmers are not benefitted by the largesse,” he said.The cost of water is not factored in while fixing the minimum support price of paddy, he pointed out. The expenditure towards providing free water should be diverted to installing efficient irrigation systems, like drip or sprinklers, he suggested.“Otherwise, the government could pass on the subsidy to farmers based on cultivated land and such aid will not offend WTO provision for agriculture,” he said.In the ongoing financial year, the Punjab government has made a provision of Rs 8,969 crore to supply free power for irrigation.In Punjab, the need for diversification was first felt in 1984 — not due to over-exploitation of groundwater at that time.A surplus paddy output had caused serious glitches in procurement, resulting in rotting of the food grains. It raised the need for altering cropping pattern.“I had submitted a diversification roadmap as early as in 1982 and then in 2002, but subsequent droughts in the later years allowed the policymakers to push the reports under the carpet,” Johal said.Intensive groundwater-based irrigation has deteriorated the quality of soil, making it alkaline in Punjab even as neighbouring Haryana is tackling rising salinity.The intense paddy-wheat cropping paddy in summer, followed by wheat in winter — has affected productivity and quality of water as well as soil.Some well-to-do farmers like Navjot Singh Shergill, a resident of Munjal Khurd village 20 km from the city of Patiala, had taken to farming of strawberry in a part of his ancestral land.“I diversified from traditional crops out of realisation that parts of Punjab will be desert in less than a decade given the extent of the exploitation of groundwater,” he said.In the southern districts of Punjab, market dynamics are driving farmers to change. They are increasingly planting cotton, thanks to demand from local textile mills and cross border trade with Pakistan.“The earnings from cotton could surpass paddy by 40-50% in a good crop year,” said Shamsher Singh, a cotton grower from Bathinda.However, the cotton market has currently been hit by the prevailing tension between India and Pakistan. Direct exports of raw cotton and cotton yarn to Pakistan have been affected.Meanwhile, Gurmail Singh, the Ludhiana farmer, is bullish about the crop of maize on his field as it is in excellent condition. The cost of inputs has come at par with paddy, but he isn’t concerned about that.“The yield is going to be higher than my expectation,” Singh said, even as he thanked the district agriculture department for hand-holding him to move beyond paddy.He is hopeful that the demand for more than 2 million tonnes of maize from the poultry sector in Punjab alone would keep prices above the minimum support price of Rs 1,700 per quintal last year.“The demand has increased maize prices much above the minimum support price in the last year,” he said.

One of the best resources to prepare for the exams is to solve these CBSE Class 10 Geography Important Questions we have compiled here. Students will find it easier to revise the subject with the help of these questions. These CBSE Class 10 important questions of Geography cover all the essential topics from the chapters of the NCERT books, based on which the exam papers are formulated.</p>
<p>Students can find and download the chapter-wise CBSE Important Questions of Geography from the respective links provided in the table below:</p>
<p>Resources and Development Class 10 Important Questions</p>
<p>Question 1.</p>
<p>What do you understand by a ‘Resource’? Give examples. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Everything available in our environment which can be used to satisfy our needs, is called a resource. It should be technologically accessible, economically feasible and culturally acceptable. Only then, it can be termed as a ‘Resource’. Examples are: minerals, forests, fossil fuels etc..</p>
<p>Question 2.</p>
<p>“Resources are a function of human activities.” Justify this statement.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Mere presence of resources, as free gifts of nature, does not make them resources. Human beings are essential components of resources because they transform material available in our environment into resources. The utility of resources depends on the stage of cultural development of man and the tools and technology used by him.</p>
<p>Question 3.</p>
<p>Write the classification of resources on four different bases. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Resources can be classified in the following four ways:</p>
<p>(a) On the basis of Origin:</p>
<p>Biotic</p>
<p>Abiotic</p>
<p>(b) On the basis of exhaustibility:</p>
<p>Renewable</p>
<p>Non-renewable</p>
<p>(c) On the basis of ownership:</p>
<p>Individual (Personal)</p>
<p>Community</p>
<p>National</p>
<p>International</p>
<p>(d) On the basis of status and development:</p>
<p>Potential</p>
<p>Developed</p>
<p>Reserve</p>
<p>Stock</p>
<p>Question 4.</p>
<p>Explain the classification of resources on the basis of origin and give one example of each.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>On the basis of origin, resources can be classified as Biotic and Abiotic.</p>
<p>Biotic Resources are obtained from the biosphere. They have life or are living resources, e.g., human beings, fisheries, forests, etc.</p>
<p>Abiotic Resources include all non-living things, e.g., rocks and minerals.</p>
<p>Question 5.</p>
<p>Classify the resources on the basis of exhaustibility and give two examples of each.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>On the basis of exhaustibility, resources can be classified as: Renewable and Non-renewable.</p>
<p>Renewable Resources. The resources which can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical and mechanical processes are known as renewable or replenishable resources, e.g., water, wildlife, forests, solar energy, wind energy etc.</p>
<p>Non-renewable Resources. The resources which once get exhausted, cannot be remade. They take a long geological period of time, i.e., millions of years in their formation, e.g., minerals, fossil fuels etc.</p>
<p>Question 6.</p>
<p>Write two types of renewable resources and give one example of each type.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Two types of renewable resources are as follows:</p>
<p>Continuous or Flow Resources, e.g., wind and water resources. Biological Resources, e.g., natural vegetation (forests) and wildlife.</p>
<p>Question 7.</p>
<p>Write two characteristics of non-renewable resources and write their two broad categories with examples.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Two characteristics of non-renewable resources:</p>
<p>They cannot be recycled and get exhausted with their use. They take millions of years in their formation.</p>
<p>Two broad categories of non-renewable resources:</p>
<p>Recyclable resources, e.g., metals. Non-recyclable resources, e.g., fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Question 8.</p>
<p>Give any two examples of non-renewable resources. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Non-renewable resources are resources which once get exhausted, cannot be remade. They take a long geological period of time, i.e., millions of years, in their formation, e.g., minerals, fossil fuels, etc.</p>
<p>Question 9.</p>
<p>Explain four types of resources based on ownership and give one example of each type. (2014)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>On the basis of ownership, there are four types of resources:</p>
<p>Individual Resources. Resources, which are owned privately by individuals, e.g., farmers own</p>
<p>pieces of land or houses. Plantation, pasture lands, water in wells are some resources owned by individuals. Community Owned Resources. These resources are accessible to all the members of the community, e.g., village ponds, public parks, playgrounds in urban areas are accessible to all the residents of that area. National Resources. All the resources within the political boundary of a nation including the territorial water (oceanic area upto 12 nautical miles from the coast) extending into the ocean and resources therein belong to the nation, e.g., all minerals, forests, wildlife, water resources, land etc. International Resources. There are international institutions which own and regulate some resources, e.g., The oceanic resources beyond 200 km of the Exclusive Economic Zone belong to the open ocean and no individual country can utilise these without the concurrence of international institutions.</p>
<p>Question 10.</p>
<p>Distinguish between the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Potential and Developed Resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock and Reserves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Potential Resources. Resources which are found in a region, but have not been utilised, e.g.r Gujarat and Rajasthan have a lot of potential for the development of wind and solar energy, but so far they have not been developed fully.</li>
</ol>
<p>Developed Resources. Resources which are surveyed and their quality and quantity have been determined for utilisation. The development of resources depends on technology and level of their feasibility, e.g., water resources used for hydel power generation or irrigation purposes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stock. Materials in the environment, which have the potential to satisfy human needs but man does not have the appropriate technology to access them are included among stock, e.g. water is a compound of two inflammable gases: hydrogen and oxygen, which can be used as a rich Source of energy. But we do not have the required technical know-how to use them for this purpose. Reserves. Reserves are the subset of the stock, which can be put into use with the help of existing technical ‘know-how’ but their full use has been postponed for meeting the future needs, e.g., forest reserves, iron-ore reserves, water in the dams etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 11.</p>
<p>Name the categories under which natural resources can be grouped on the basis of state of development.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Potential Resources Developed Resources Stock Reserves.</p>
<p>Question 12.</p>
<p>How are natural resources important for man? Give five points.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Importance of resources for man:</p>
<p>Resources are vital for human survival. They are important for maintaining the quality of life as man has been using the bio-physical environment to satisfy his needs. Natural resources form the backbone of the economy of a nation. These are the bases for economic strength and prosperity of the people. They provide material, energy and favourable conditions for development.</p>
<p>Question 13.</p>
<p>List the problems which resulted due to indiscriminate use of resources by man.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>It has resulted in depletion of many resources. Accumulation of resources in few hands which, in turn, divided the society in two segments, i.e., haves and have-nots or rich and poor. It has led to the global ecological crisis, e.g., global warming, ozone layer depletion, environmental pollution, land degradation, etc.</p>
<p>Question 14.</p>
<p>“Resource planning is essential for sustainable existence.” Discuss.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Sustainable existence is a component of sustainable development which aims at development without damaging the environment and at the same time conserving for future generation. Therefore, resource planning is necessary for judicious, rational and equitable distribution and proper utilisation of resources. It has become essential for a sustained quality of life and global peace.</p>
<p>Question 15.</p>
<p>What do you understand by ‘sustainable economic development’?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Sustainable economic development means that ‘development should take place without damaging the environment and development in the present should not compromise with the needs of future generation.’</p>
<p>Question 16.</p>
<p>Why is ‘Resource Planning’ necessary? Give reasons.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Planning is necessary for proper and judicious utilisation of resources.</p>
<p>Reasons for resource planning:</p>
<p>Resource availability is not the same in all parts of the country. Resources, especially non-renewable resources, need extra care as they Cannot be renewed. There is acute shortage or deficiency of some resources. Resource planning helps in proper utilisation of resources by reducing wastage. It takes care of future needs and may sustain the environment.</p>
<p>Question 17.</p>
<p>“India has enormous diversity in the availability of resources.” Name four varied regions to justify this statement.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>There are regions which are rich or self-sufficient in certain types of resources and there are areas that are deficient or have acute shortage of some vital resources.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>The states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water resources but lacks in infrastructural development. Rajasthan is very well endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources. The cold desert area of Ladakh has very rich cultural heritage. It is deficient in water, infrastructure and some vital minerals.</p>
<p>Such cases call for balanced resource planning at different levels.</p>
<p>Question 18.</p>
<p>Explain three stages of ‘resource planning.’ (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Three stages of resource planning:</p>
<p>Identification and inventory of resources across the regions of the country. This involves surveying, mapping and the qualitative and quantitative estimation and measurement of the resources. Evolving a planning structure endowed with appropriate technology, skill and institutional set up for implementing resource development plAnswer: Matching the resource development plans with overall national development plAnswer:</p>
<p>Question 19.</p>
<p>“Planning is the widely accepted strategy for judicious use of resources in a country like India”. Justify this statement with two relevant points and an example. (2013)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>India has enormous diversity in the availability of resources. Through planning, regions which have shortage of vital resources and those having adequate quantities, receive equal attention.</p>
<p>There are regions which are rich in certain types of resources but are deficient in some other resources.</p>
<p>For example: Arunachal has abundance of water but lacks in infrastructural development. There are some regions which can be considered self sufficient in terms of availability of resources. For example: The states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. There are some regions which have acute shortage of some vital resources.</p>
<p>For example: The state of Rajasthan is well endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources.</p>
<p>Question 20.</p>
<p>Write four factors which determine resource development in a region.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Four factors involved in the development of resources are:</p>
<p>Availability of resources Level of technology Quality of human resources Historical experiences of the people</p>
<p>Question 21.</p>
<p>What do you understand by ‘conservation of resources’? Why is it necessary to conserve our resources? Give three reasons.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Conservation is judicious and planned use of natural resources for sustainable benefit to the present generation. It also maintains a potential to meet the needs and aspirations of future generations.</p>
<p>Three reasons for conservation:</p>
<p>Our resources are limited in nature, therefore they have to be frugally used. Many of the resources are non-renewable in nature, therefore extra care has to be taken. Their conservation is necessary for our own sustenance and for the ongoing economic developmental processes.</p>
<p>Question 22.</p>
<p>Explain the concept of resource conservation as voiced by Gandhiji. (2012)</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Whom did Gandhiji make responsible for the depletion of resources at the global level?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Gandhiji voiced his concern about resource conservation in these Words: “There is enough far everybody’s need and not for anybody’s greed.” He placed the greedy and selfish individuals as the root cause for resource depletion at the global level. He was against ‘mass production’ and wanted to replace it with ‘production by the masses’.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate use of resources by human beings has led to the depletion of resources for satisfying the greed of few individuals. Irrational consumption and over-utilization of resources leads to socio-economic and environmental problems.</p>
<p>Question 23.</p>
<p>Write four institutional efforts made at global level for ‘resource conservation’.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>At the international level, the Club of Rome advocated resource conservation for the first time in a more systematic way in 1968. In 1974, the Gandhian Philosophy was presented once again by Schumacher in his book “Small is Beautiful”. Brundtland Commission Report in 1987, introduced the concept of ‘sustainable development’ and advocated it as a means for resource conservation. This was subsequently published in a book entitled “Our Common Future”. In June 1992, the first ‘International Earth Summit’ was held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, in which 100 heads of States met for addressing urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development at the global level.</p>
<p>Question 24.</p>
<p>Write the major features of Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In 1992,100 heads of States met in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first ‘International Earth Summit’. The summit was convened for addressing urgent problems of: environmental protection and</p>
<p>socio-economic development at global level. The assembled leaders signed the Declaration on Global Climatic Change and the Biological Diversity. The Rio convention endorsed the global Forest Principles and adopted ‘Agenda 21’ for achieving sustainable development in the 21st century. It is an agenda to combat environmental damage, poverty and diseases through global co-operation on common interests, mutual needs and shared responsibilities.</p>
<p>Question 25.</p>
<p>“The future generation may not have sufficient resources as compared to the present generation”. Justify the statement by giving suitable examples. (2012)</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Why is the issue of sustainability relevant for development?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Present sources of energy in India are coal, petroleum, natural gas, solar energy, wind energy, hydel power, electricity, wood for fire, cow dung etc. Most of these are non-renewable sources of energy which may get exhausted after some time. These are available in limited quantities. The present rate of consumption is higher than the rate at which these resources are being replenished and should be preserved for our future generations.</p>
<p>In fifty years’ time, India may depend largely on non-conventional sources of energy which are available in abundance such as solar energy, hydel energy, wind energy etc. The total hydel power potential in India is estimated at 1,50,000 MW of which only one-sixth has been developed so far.</p>
<p>Development of a country needs to be continuous. Every country would like to have the level of development go up further. Many scientists have warned that the present levels of development cannot be sustained for the future as the present rate of consumption of both renewable and non-renewable resources is very high. Rapid industrialisation has led to environment degradation. Sustainability development aims at development without damaging the environment and at the same time conserving for the future. Sustainability of development is essential not only for the present generation but also for future generations to ensure a good life.</p>
<p>Land Resources</p>
<p>Question 26.</p>
<p>Why is land as a resource important for us? Write four points.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>95% of our basic needs of food, clothing and shelter are derived from land. We live on land and use it in different ways, e.g. for agriculture, for transport and communication systems, etc. We perform our economic activities on land. It supports natural vegetation, wildlife and human life.</p>
<p>Question 27.</p>
<p>Why land-use should be done in a planned manner? Write two points.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Land is a fixed asset. As land is used for varied purposes and activities and for human sustenance, therefore it is important to use the available land for various purposes with careful planning.</p>
<p>Question 28.</p>
<p>Look at the picture and name three major relief features of India and their respective share in the total area.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Three major relief features:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Plains — 43%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mountains — 30%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plateaus — 27%</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 29.</p>
<p>Name the relief feature occupying the largest area, along with its percentage share in the total area.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Plains occupy the largest area having 43% share in the total area.</p>
<p>Question 30.</p>
<p>Name three main relief features of India and write the importance of each.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Relief Features Their Importance /Uses 1. Plains (i) provide facilities for agriculture.(ii) provide facilities for industrial development. (iii) because of their level, nature and ease of construction, plains support huge population of the country. 2. Mountains (i) ensure perennial flow of some rivers and many rivers rise from them.(ii) provide facilities for tourism. (iii) are important from ecological point of view, e.g. have lot of forest wealth and wildlife. 3. Plateaus (i) possess rich reserves of minerals.(ii) contain lot of fossil fuels, especially coal. (iii) possess rich forest cover.</p>
<p>Question 31.</p>
<p>Look at the picture and explain the land-use pattern in India. Why has land under forest not increased much since 1960-61?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The major land-use categories and their percentage share is:</p>
<p>Net sown area, where regular agriculture is done — 43.41%. Forests, 22.57% of the total land is covered by forests. Barren and waste land — 6.29%. Area under non-agricultural use — 7.92%. Permanent pastures and grazing land — 3.45%. Area under miscellaneous tree crops and groves — 1.1%. Culturable waste land — 4.41 % Fallows other than current fallows — 3.82% Current fallow – 7.03%</p>
<p>The land under forests has increased marginally by about 4.46%. From 18.11% in 1960-61, it is still only 22.57% which is far lower than the desired 33% as outlined by the National Forest Policy (1952).</p>
<p>Reasons for marginal increase in forest area:</p>
<p>increasing population technological developments expansion of agriculture development of transport and communication facilities overgrazing felling of trees</p>
<p>All these exert great pressure on land thus causing further depletion of forests.</p>
<p>Question 32.</p>
<p>Distinguish between each of the following:</p>
<p>(a) Current fallow and other than current fallow land</p>
<p>(b) Waste-land and culturable waste-land</p>
<p>(c) Net sown area and gross cropped area.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>(a) Current fallow land. Land left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural year.</p>
<p>Other than current fallow land. Land left uncultivated for the past one to five agricultural years.</p>
<p>(b) Waste land. It includes rocky, arid and desert areas which are lying waste at the moment. Culturable waste land. Arable land which is left uncultivated for more than five agricultural years.</p>
<p>(c) Net Sown Area. It is the total area under cultivation.</p>
<p>Gross Cropped Area. Area sown more than once in an agricultural year plus net sown area.</p>
<p>Question 33.</p>
<p>What do you understand by ‘reported area’? What is the reported area of India and why? Give two major reasons.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The percentage of total area for which land-use statistics (data) are available, is termed as ‘reported area’. India’s reported area is 93%.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<p>Because the land-use reporting for most of the north-eastern states, except Assam, has not been done.</p>
<p>Some areas of Jammu and Kashmir occupied by Pakistan and China have not been surveyed.</p>
<p>Question 34.</p>
<p>Write three physical and three human factors which determine the use of land.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Physical Factors:</p>
<p>Topography</p>
<p>Climate</p>
<p>Soil types</p>
<p>Human Factors:</p>
<p>Population density</p>
<p>Technological capability</p>
<p>Culture and traditions</p>
<p>Question 35.</p>
<p>Why are the other than current fallow-lands cultivated once or twice in about two to three years? Give two reasons.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Two reasons are:</p>
<p>These lands may be of poor quality. The cost of cultivation of such lands is very high.</p>
<p>Question 36.</p>
<p>“The pattern of net sown area varies greatly from one state to another.”</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Name two states having high net sown area and two states having low net sown area. Give two reasons for each.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Punjab and Haryana are two states, which have more than 80% of their total area as N.S.A. (Net Sown Area) because:</p>
<p>They are agriculturally rich States because of favourable climatic conditions for the growth of crops and levelled fertile nature of land. Irrigation facilities are well-developed here.</p>
<p>States with low N.S.A. i.e., less than 10% are Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram because:</p>
<p>The nature of land is hilly and forested, therefore availability of arable land is less. Economic backwardness and climatic conditions also do not encourage large scale agricultural activities.</p>
<p>Question 37.</p>
<p>According to National Forest Policy, how much of the country’s area should be under forest cover and why? Give two considerations for this norm. Have we been able to meet this norm?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>According to National Forest Policy, 33% of the country’s total area should be under forest cover.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<p>It is considered essential for the maintenance of ecological balance. The livelihood of millions of people who live on the fringe of these forests depends on these forests.</p>
<p>We have 22.57% area under forests which is far lower than the desired 33% of geographical area, as outlined by National Forest Policy.</p>
<p>Question 38.</p>
<p>What is land degradation? What is the area of degraded land in India? Name four types of waste-lands and their percentage share respectively.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Damage to the land, bringing down its quality is called land degradation.</p>
<p>Continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage it, results in land degradation. India has 130 million hectares of degraded land.</p>
<p>Four categories of waste-lands:</p>
<p>Water eroded area .. 56% Forest degraded area .. 28% Wind eroded area .. 10% Saline and Alkaline land .. 6%</p>
<p>Question 39.</p>
<p>Write six human activities which have caused land degradation.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Deforestation Overgrazing Mining activities — mining sites are abandoned after excavation leaving deep scars and traces of over-burdening. Mineral processing produces large quantities of dust in the atmosphere, which on settling down on land, retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil. Over-irrigation leads to waterlogging which increases salinity and alkalinity in the soil. Industrial effluents — such wastes cause land and water pollution.</p>
<p>Question 40.</p>
<p>Which factor is mainly responsible for maximum land degradation in India? (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Over-grazing is one of the main reasons for land degradation. States where over-grazing has resulted in land degradation are Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Question 41.</p>
<p>Distinguish between biotic and abiotic resources by stating four points.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Difference between biotic and abiotic resources</p>
<p>Biotic resources Abiotic resources (i) The resources which are obtained from biosphere are biotic resources. (i) All those things which are composed of non­living things are called abitoic resources. (ii) They have life. (ii) They do not have life. (iii) These include flora and fauna, fisheries, livestock, human beings, etc. (iii) These incoude rocks, metals, land, air, mountains, rivers, etc. (iv) Minerals such as coal and petroleum are included in this category because they were formed from decayed organic matter. (iv) Minerals such as gold, iron, copper, silver, etc. come in this category.</p>
<p>Question 42.</p>
<p>Name three states each in which land degradation is caused due to</p>
<p>over-irrigation over-grazing deforestation due to mining activities</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Three states where over-irrigation has resulted in land degradation are Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. Due to over-grazing. Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Deforestation due to mining activities has led to land degradation in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>Question 43.</p>
<p>Write some measures/ways to solve problems of land degradation. (2014)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Measures to conserve land:</p>
<p>Afforestation. Proper management of grazing to control over-grazing. Planting of shelter belts of plants. Stabilisation of sand dunes by growing thorny bushes. Control of mining activities. Proper discharge and disposal of industrial effluents and wastes after treatment. Proper management of waste-lands Avoid over-irrigation, especially in dry areas. Avoid overuse of fertilisers and pesticides.</p>
<p>Soil As A Resouce</p>
<p>Question 44.</p>
<p>What is soil? How is it an important resource for us?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Soil is the uppermost layer of the earth’s crust which is loose, fragmented and fine. It is rich in both organic (humus) and inorganic materials and supports plant growth.</p>
<p>Soil is a living system. It takes millions of years to form soil upto a few cm in depth.</p>
<p>It is an important resource because:</p>
<p>It is the medium of plant growth.</p>
<p>It supports different types of living organisms on earth.</p>
<p>Question 45.</p>
<p>Write the main factors responsible for soil formation.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Soil is a living system. It takes millions of years to form soil up to a few centimeters in depth.</p>
<p>Factors responsible for soil formation are:</p>
<p>Parent rock or bed rock on which the soils are formed, disintegrate and decompose under the process of weathering and erosion. Climate: It determines the rate of weathering. Relief, vegetation, other forms of life and time are other important factors in the formation of soils. Various forces of nature such as change in temperature, actions of running water, wind and glaciers, activities of decomposers etc. also contribute to the formation of soil. Chemical and organic changes which take place in soil, also play a role in its formation.</p>
<p>Question 46.</p>
<p>Write four factors which are responsible for varied types of soils in India.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Factors:</p>
<p>Varied relief features Varied land forms Varied climatic realms Varied vegetation types.</p>
<p>Question 47.</p>
<p>On what basis are soils classified into different types?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Basis of classification of soils:</p>
<p>Colour Thickness Texture Age Chemical and physical properties Factors responsible for soil formation.</p>
<p>Question 48.</p>
<p>Name six types of soils found in India. Which is the most widely spread soil? Name one major region where it is found.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Alluvial soil Red and yellow soil Black soil Laterite soil Arid soil Forest and mountainous soils</p>
<p>Alluvial soil is the most widely spread soil.</p>
<p>The entire northern plains are made of alluvial soil.</p>
<p>Question 49.</p>
<p>Write three regional/local names of areas where you find coarse alluvial soil and name one deltaic area which has fine alluvial soil.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Coarse alluvial soil is more common in piedmont plains such as Duars, Chos and Terai.</p>
<p>Fine alluvial soil is found in the eastern coastal plains in the deltas of Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri rivers.</p>
<p>Question 50.</p>
<p>Classify alluvial soils on the basis of their age. Write two characteristics of each.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>According to their age, alluvial soils are of two types: Bangar and Khadar.</p>
<p>Bangar Khadar (i) It is old alluvial soil. (i) It is new alluvial soil. (ii) It has higher concentration of ‘kankar’ nodules. (ii) It has more fine particles. (iii) It is coarser and is found in the old river terraces. (iii) It is more fertile than ‘Bangar’ and is found in flood plains.</p>
<p>Question 51.</p>
<p>Write the main characteristics of alluvial soils.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile. They consist of various proportions of sand, silt and clay. They contain adequate proportion of potash, lime and phosphoric acid. They are ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy, wheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due to its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are intensively cultivated and are densely populated. Soils in the drier areas are more alkaline and can be productive after proper treatment and irrigation.</p>
<p>Question 52.</p>
<p>Give the distribution of alluvial soils in brief.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The entire northern plains are made up of alluvial soils.</p>
<p>These have been deposited by three important Himalayan river systems</p>
<p>the Indus. Ganga and Brahmaputra.</p>
<p>These soils also extend into Rajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow corridor.</p>
<p>These are also found in the eastern coastal plains in the deltas of the Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri rivers.</p>
<p>Question 53.</p>
<p>Write two factors which are responsible for the formation of black soils. Name four States where they are found. Name the crop mainly grown in it.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Two factors are:</p>
<p>The climatic conditions The parent rock material.</p>
<p>Four states in which black soils are found are: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Black soil is ideal for growing cotton and is also called black cotton soil.</p>
<p>Question 54.</p>
<p>Write six characteristics of regur soils (black soils). (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>They are made up of extremely fine, i.e. clayey material. They have capacity to hold moisture that makes them ideal for growing cotton. They are rich in soil nutrients such as calcium carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime. These soils are generally poor in phosphoric contents. They develop deep cracks during dry hot weather, which helps in the proper aeration of soil. These soils are sticky when wet and difficult to work unless tilled immediately after the first shower.</p>
<p>Question 55.</p>
<p>Give the distribution of black/regur Soil. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>This soil is typical of the Deccan Trap region.</p>
<p>It is spread over north west Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.</p>
<p>This soil covers the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh and extends along the Godavari and Krishna Valleys.</p>
<p>Question 56.</p>
<p>In what broad category do the soils of Maharashtra fall? (2014)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Black soil region also known as regur soils.</p>
<p>Question 57.</p>
<p>What is regur soil? Write its two features. Mention any two regions where regur soil is found.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Regur soil is soil which is made up of extremely fine, i.e., clayey material.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>They have capacity to hold moisture that makes them ideal for growing cotton. They are rich in soil nutrients such as calcium carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime. These soils are generally poor in phosphoric contents. They develop deep cracks during dry hot weather, which helps in the proper aeration of soil. These soils are sticky when wet and difficult to work unless tilled immediately after the first shower.</p>
<p>Regions where regur soil is found:</p>
<p>This soil is typical of the Deccan Trap region. It is spread over north west Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows. This soil covers the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and extends along the Godavari and Krishna Valleys.</p>
<p>Question 58.</p>
<p>Write the distribution of red and yellow soils. Give reasons for their colour.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>How does red soil develop and in which part of India? What makes it look red and yellow?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In Eastern and Southern parts of Deccan plateau, red soils have developed on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall. They are also found in parts of Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Southern parts of the middle Ganga Plains and along the piedmont zone of Western Ghats.</p>
<p>These soils develop a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks yellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.</p>
<p>Question 59.</p>
<p>Write four characteristics of laterite soils. Why are they called laterite?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>They are highly leached soils. They develop in areas of heavy rainfall and high temperature. They have low ‘humus’ content, because most of the micro-organisms particularly decomposers like bacteria get destroyed due to high temperature. These soils can be cultivated with adequate doses of manure and fertilisers.</p>
<p>The word laterite has been derived from the Latin word ‘late/ which means brick. Since their colour is red and resembles brick colour, these soils are called laterite soils.</p>
<p>Question 60.</p>
<p>Write six states which have laterite soils and name the important crops which grow well in these soils.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Six states in which laterite soils are found: Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and the hilly areas of Orissa and Assam.</p>
<p>Crops which grow well in these soils are: tea, coffee and cashew-nuts.</p>
<p>Question 61.</p>
<p>Write the main characteristics of arid soils. (2014)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Arid soils range from red to brown in colour. They have a sandy texture. They are saline in nature. In areas where salt content in high, common salt is obtained by evaporation. Arid soil lacks humus and is moisture deficient. The lower horizons of the soil have kankars because of high calcium content which restrict infiltration of water. Proper irrigation helps make these soils cultivable, e.g., Western Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Question 62.</p>
<p>Write the main features of forest soils. What are the different types of soils found in the hilly forested areas?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Forest soils are mainly found in the hilly and mountainous areas where sufficient rain forests are available. The soil texture varies according to the mountain environment where they are formed. At least four types of soils can be seen in the hilly forested areas:</p>
<p>They are loamy and silty in valley sides. They are coarse grained in upper slopes. They are highly denuded, acidic with low humus content in the snow covered areas. They are very fine and fertile in lower parts of the valley and on river terraces.</p>
<p>Question 63.</p>
<p>What is soil erosion? Write the main causes of soil erosion.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The denudation of the soil cover and subsequent washing down is described as soil erosion.</p>
<p>The process of soil formation and erosion goes on simultaneously and generally there is a balance between the two. This balance is sometimes disturbed, leading to soil erosion. The main activities like deforestation, over-grazing, construction and mining and also natural agents like wind, running water and glacier are the main causes of soil erosion.</p>
<p>Question 64.</p>
<p>Explain three types of soil erosion mostly observed in India. Mention human activities that are responsible for soil erosion. (2012)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Gully erosion</p>
<p>The running water cuts through the clayey soils and makes deep channels,</p>
<p>called gullies. They make the land unfit for cultivation. Such lands are called ‘Badlands’. Sheet erosion</p>
<p>Sometimes water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. In this case top layer of the soil is washed away. Wind erosion</p>
<p>Wind blows off loose and dry soil from flat and sloping land causing erosion.</p>
<p>Question 65.</p>
<p>Write the land area degraded by gully erosion and name five states where gully erosion is very pronounced.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Approximately 40 lakh hectares of land area has degraded due to gully erosion.</p>
<p>Five states where gully erosion is quite pronounced are: Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat.</p>
<p>Question 66.</p>
<p>Write four methods of soil conservation.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Methods of soil conservation:</p>
<p>Contour ploughing By ploughing along the contour lines, water will not run down the slopes. Terrace cultivation Steps can be cut on the slopes to make terraces. This restricts erosion. Strip cropping Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops. This breaks the force of the wind. Planting of shelter belts The planting of trees in rows to create shelter also breaks the force of the wind and restricts soil erosion.</p>
<p>Shelter belts have helped in the stabilisation of sand dunes and deserts.</p>
<p>Forest and Wildlife Resources Class 10 Important Questions</p>
<p>Question 1.</p>
<p>Name four animals and two species of flora which are on the verge of extinction.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Animals and plants on the verge of extinction:</p>
<p>Four animals: Cheetah, pink-headed duck, mountain quail, forest spotted owlet.</p>
<p>Two plants:</p>
<p>Wild mahua (madhuca insignis) hubbardia heptaneuron (a species of grass).</p>
<p>Question 2.</p>
<p>Name six groups of flora and fauna under which they are classified by International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Normal species</p>
<p>Species, whose population levels are considered to be normal for their survival. Endangered species</p>
<p>Species, which are in danger of extinction because their population is declining. For example, Black buck, Indian rhino, lion-tailed macaque and Indian wild ass. Vulnerable resources</p>
<p>These are the species whose population has declined so much that they are likely to move into endangered category in the near future, if negative factors continue to operate. For example, Blue sheep, Asiatic elephant, Gangetic dolphin. Rare species</p>
<p>Species with small population. If care is not taken they may also become endangered species. For example, Himalayan Brown bear, desert fox, wild Asiatic buffalo, hornbill. Endemic species</p>
<p>Species which are only found in particular areas usually isolated by natural or geographical barriers. For example, Andaman teal, Nicobar pigeon, Andaman wild pig. Extinct species</p>
<p>These are species which are not found after searches of known or likely areas where they may occur, i.e., the species which were existing earlier, but are not seen today.</p>
<p>Question 4.</p>
<p>Name any four resources which are obtained from our biodiversity.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The resources are: wood, rubber, medicines and dyes.</p>
<p>Question 5</p>
<p>Write four major reasons for the depletion of forest cover.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Deforestation for agricultural purposes. Shifting cultivation which is still practised in substantial parts of tribal belts. Large-scale development of river valley projects. Mining activities have also resulted in deforestation. For example, the tiger reserve in West Bengal is seriously threatened by the ongoing dolomite mining. Environmental pollution and forest fires have also led to depletion of forests.</p>
<p>Question 6.</p>
<p>Write three adverse impacts of dolomite mining in the Buxar Tiger Reserve on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Adverse effects of dolomite mining in the Buxar Tiger Reserve:</p>
<p>It has caused ecological damage. It has blocked the migration route of several species. It has disturbed the natural habitat of many species.</p>
<p>Question 7.</p>
<p>List six factors which have led to the decline in India’s biodiversity.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Habitat destruction Over-exploitation Environmental pollution Forest fires Hunting and Poaching Poisoning</p>
<p>Question 8.</p>
<p>Write four most important causes of environmental destruction/degradation.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Unequal access to resources. Inequitable consumption of resources. Differential sharing of responsibility for environmental well being. Over-population.</p>
<p>Question 9.</p>
<p>“The destruction of biodiversity is highly correlated with the loss of cultural diversity.” Give four facts to support this statement.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Such losses have:</p>
<p>Increasingly marginalised and impoverished many forest dependent communities. Among the poor, women are affected more than men, for women bear the major responsibility of basic subsistence needs. With the depletion of these resources, the drudgery of women increased for they had to walk for more than 10 km to collect these resources which, in turn, affected their health and negligence of home and children. The indirect impact of degradation, eg. drought or floods etc. also hits the poor the hardest. Poverty is a direct outcome of environmental destruction.</p>
<p>Question 10.</p>
<p>Why do we need to conserve our biodiversity?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Conservation of biodiversity is necessary because it:</p>
<p>Preserves the ecological diversity. Preserves our life support systems, i.e., water, air and soil. Preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth and breeding of species. Fisheries too are heavily dependent on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity.</p>
<p>Question 11.</p>
<p>List various provisions made by “The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972” for protecting habitats.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>An All India list of protected species was published. The thrust was on protecting the remaining population of certain endangered species by- banning hunting;</p>
<p>giving legal protection to their habitats and</p>
<p>restricting trade in wildlife.</p>
<p>Question 12.</p>
<p>Write four steps taken by the Government for conservation of wildlife.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Five steps that have been taken to protect the wildlife in India:</p>
<p>Under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972, an All India list of protected species was published. The thrust was on protecting the remaining population of certain endangered species by – banning hunting,</p>
<p>giving legal protection to their habitats and</p>
<p>restricting trade in wildlife. Many wildlife sanctuaries have been developed and National Parks have been set up. Many projects have been started for protecting specific animals which were gravely threatened, eg. Project Tiger, One-horned Rhino, the Kashmir Stag (hangul), three types of crocodiles —the fresh water, salt-water and Gharials, the Asiatic Lion, etc. Most recently, some animals have been given full or partial legal protection against hunting and trading throughout India, eg., Indian elephant, black buck, great Indian bustard and the snow leopard, etc. Setting up of biosphere reserves for conserving flora and fauna in their natural surroundings and protection of wetland ecosystems is another step taken in this direction.</p>
<p>Question 13.</p>
<p>Which agency manages forests in India? Name three broad categories in which the forests are classified.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The forests in India are owned and managed by the Government through the Forest Department.</p>
<p>They are classified under the following categories:</p>
<p>Reserved Forests Protected Forests Unclassed Forests</p>
<p>Question 14.</p>
<p>What are ‘Permanent Forest Estates’ and why? Which state has maximum forest cover falling under this category? Write its percentage share in the total forest area of this state.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Reserved and protected forests are referred to as the Permanent Forest Estates maintained for the purpose of producing timber and other forest produce.</p>
<p>Madhya Pradesh has the largest area under permanent forests, constituting 75% of its total forest area.</p>
<p>Question 15.</p>
<p>Write the major differences between reserved and protected forests.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Difference between Reserved and Protected forests</p>
<p>Reserved forests Protected forests 1. They cover more than half of the total forest area. 1. Almost V 3 of the total forest area is protected forest. 2. They are most valuable from the point of view of forest and wildlife conservation. 2. These forest lands are protected from any further depletion.</p>
<p>Question 16.</p>
<p>Name five states which have large reserved and protected forests respectively.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Five states having large percentages of reserved forests are: Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Uttrakhand, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Protected Forests: Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Question 17.</p>
<p>What are unclassed forests? Name two areas which have high percentages of their forests as unclassed forests.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Unclassed forests are the other forests and waste lands belonging to both Government and private individuals as well as local communities.</p>
<p>Two areas with high percentage of unclassed forests are: North-Eastern states and parts of Gujarat.</p>
<p>Question 18.</p>
<p>Write three examples of conservation of biodiversity at community level. (2025)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Three examples of community participation:</p>
<p>In ‘Sariska Tiger Reserve’, Rajasthan, villagers have fought against mining by citing the Wildlife Protection Act. In many areas, villagers themselves, are protecting habitats and explicitly rejecting Government involvement. The inhabitants of five villages in the Alwar District of Rajasthan have declared 1200 hectares of forest as the ‘Bhairodev Dakav Sonchuri’, declaring their own set of rules and regulations, which do not allow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife against any outside encroachments. The famous Chipko Movement in the Himalayas has successfully resisted deforestation and has also shown that community afforestation with indigenous species can be a great success.</p>
<p>Question 19.</p>
<p>Explain the ‘Beej Bachao Andolan’ and ‘Navdanya’ concept.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Farmers and Citizens’ groups like the Beej Bachao Andolan in Tehri and Navdanya have shown that adequate levels of diversified crop production without the use of synthetic chemicals are possible and economically viable.</p>
<p>Question 20.</p>
<p>Write two characteristics of Joint Forest Management Programme and its two benefits for the community. Which Indian state started this programme first of all and when?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Joint Forest Management Programme involves local communities in the management and restoration of degraded forests. It was first started in Orissa in 1988.</p>
<p>Two characteristics: It depends on—</p>
<p>the formation of local (village) institutions that undertake protection activities mostly on degraded forest land managed by the Forest Department and the local communities also work towards restoration of such degraded forests.</p>
<p>Two benefits:</p>
<p>The members of these communities are entitled to intermediary benefits like non-timber forest products. They are also entitled to share in the timber harvested by ‘successful protection’.</p>
<p>Question 21.</p>
<p>What is biodiversity? Why is biodiversity important for human lives? Give three points.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Biodiversity denotes variety of living beings, including all types of organisms, plants and wildlife, diverse in form and functions but closely integrated in a system through multiple network of interdependencies. Its importance: We humans along with all living organisms form a complex web of ecological systems in which we are only a part and are dependent on this system for our own existence. For example, the plants, animals and micro-organisms recreate—</p>
<p>the quality of the air we breathe,</p>
<p>the water we drink and</p>
<p>the soil that produces our food without which we cannot survive. Forests play a key role in the ecological system as these are also the primary producers on which all other living beings depend not only for food but indirectly for many other forest produces which are used for varied purposes. So this biodiversity maintains an ecological balance and our life support systems (air, water and soil).</p>
<p>Question 22.</p>
<p>Write a brief note on ‘Project Tiger’.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>‘Project Tiger’ was one of the well-published wildlife campaigns in the world, launched in 1973. Initially it had shown an increase in tiger population till 1989 but in 1993 the tiger population dropped. There are 27 tiger reserves in India covering an area of 37,761 sq km.</p>
<p>Tiger conservation has been viewed not only as an effort to save the endangered species but with equal importance as a means of preserving biotypes of sizeable magnitude. Corbett National Park, (Uttarakhand), Sundarbans National Park (West Bengal), Bandhavgarh National Park (Madhya Pradesh), Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary (Rajasthan) Manas Tiger Reserve (Assam) and Periyar Tiger Reserve (Kerala) are some of the reserves in India.</p>
<p>Question 23.</p>
<p>Give an account of the forest cover in India.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The dimensions of deforestation in India are staggering. The forest and tree cover in the country is estimated at 79.42 million hectare, which is 24.16% of the total geographical area (dense forest 12.2%; open forest 9.14%; and mangrove 0.14%). According to the State of Forest Report (2015), the dense forest cover has increased by 3,775 sq km since 2013. However, this apparent increase in the forest cover is due to conservation measures, management interventions and plantation, etc., by different agencies.</p>
<p>Question 24.</p>
<p>Give an account of the Himalayan Yew highlighting its importance.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The Himalayan Yew is in trouble. The Himalayan Yew (Taxuswallachiana) is a medicinal plant found in various parts of Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh. A chemical compound called ‘taxol’ is extracted from the bark, needles, twigs and roots of this tree, and it has been successfully used to treat some cancers-the drug is now the biggest selling anti-cancer drug in the world.</p>
<p>The species is under great threat due to over-exploitation. In the last one decade, thousands of yew trees have dried up in various parts of Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>Question 25.</p>
<p>Give the main characteristics of the Asiatic Cheetah. Where has it gone?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The world’s fastest land mammal, the cheetah (Acinonyxjubantus), is a unique and specialised member of the cat family and can move at the speed of 112 km./hr. The cheetah is often mistaken for a leopard. Its distinguishing marks are the long teardrop shaped lines on each side of the nose from the comer of its eyes to its mouth. Prior to the 20th century, cheetahs were widely distributed throughout Africa and Asia. Today, the Asian cheetah is nearly extinct due to a decline of available habitat and prey. The species was declared extinct in India long back in 1952.</p>
<p>Question 26.</p>
<p>‘33% of area should be under forests’. Justify the statement highlighting the environmental values of forests.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Forest area in the country is far lower than the desired 33% of geographical area, as outlined in the National Forest Policy (1952). Forests are considered essential for maintenance of the ecological balance. The livelihood of millions of people who live on the fringes of these forests depend upon it.</p>
<p>Forests play a key role in the ecological system as these are also the primary producers on which all other living beings depend. The forest preserves the ecological diversity and our life support systems—water, air and soil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding. The destruction of forests have marginalised and impoverished many indigenous forest dependent communities. The indirect impact of degradation is severe drought or induced floods. Poverty is a direct outcome of environmental destruction.</p>
<p>Question 27.</p>
<p>Assess the need for the conservation of forests and wildlife in India.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>There is a need to conserve the forests and wildlife in India:</p>
<p>Conservation of biodiversity is necessary because it preserves the ecological diversity.</p>
<p>Forests and wildlife preserve our life support systems, i.e., water, air and soil. For example, the plants, animals and micro-organisms recreate the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that produces our food without which we cannot survive.</p>
<p>It also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth and breeding of species. For example, in agriculture we are still dependent on traditional crop varieties.</p>
<p>Fisheries too are heavily dependent on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity.</p>
<p>Forests are primary producers on which all other living beings depend not only for food but indirectly for many other forest produces which are used for varied purposes.</p>
<p>Water Resources Class 10 Important Questions</p>
<p>Question 1.</p>
<p>Give some facts and figures about the water resources in the world.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>96.5 per cent of the total volume of world’s water is estimated to exist as oceans and only 2.5 per cent exists as fresh water.</p>
<p>70 per cent of the fresh water occurs as ice sheets and glaciers in Antarctica, Greenland and the mountainous regions of the world. Less than 30% is stored as groundwater in the world’s acquifiers.</p>
<p>Question 2.</p>
<p>Explain how water becomes a renewable resource?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Fresh water is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water. This is continually being renewed and recharged through the hydrological cycle.</p>
<p>All the water moves within the hydrological cycle making water a renewable resource.</p>
<p>Question 3.</p>
<p>What percentage of global precipitation does India receive?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>India receives nearly 4 per cent of the global precipitation.</p>
<p>Question 4.</p>
<p>Where is India ranked in terms of water availability per person per annum? By what year will India join countries having absolute water scarcity?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>India ranks 133 in the world in terms of water availability per person per annum. By 2025, large parts of India will join countries having absolute water scarcity.</p>
<p>Question 5.</p>
<p>Give an estimate of India’s renewable water resources.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The total renewable water resources of India are estimated at 1897 sq km per annum.</p>
<p>Question 6.</p>
<p>Write three sources of fresh water.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Three sources are:</p>
<p>Precipitation — from rainfall. Surface water — in rivers, lakes, etc. Ground water — water stored in underground acquifers which gets recharged by rainfall.</p>
<p>Question 7.</p>
<p>What is water scarcity? Write the main reasons for water scarcity. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Water scarcity means shortage of water. It is usually associated with regions having low rainfall or drought prone areas. There are many other reasons which lead to scarcity of water.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<p>Large growing population—means more water required for domestic use and also to produce more food. In the agricultural sector, water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated areas and dry-season agriculture. More water required for irrigation purposes to facilitate higher food production, i.e., for doing multiple cropping and for HYV seeds. There is greater demand for water with growing urbanisation and industrialisation. An unequal access to water among different social groups. The quality of water is deteriorating, i.e., getting polluted by domestic and industrial wastes, chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture. Excessive use of water by industries which also require water to generate hydro-electric power to run them. Over exploitation of water in the urban areas. Housing societies and colonies have their own ground-water pumping devices. This causes depletion of fragile water resources in the cities.</p>
<p>Question 8.</p>
<p>How intensive industrialisation and urbanisation have posed a great pressure on existing fresh water resources in India? Explain with two examples for each. (2012)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Intensive industrialisation and urbanisation have put greater pressure on existing fresh water resources. With the ever growing number of industries, the demand for water has grown tremendously:</p>
<p>Industries are heavy users of fresh water as water is required for cooling the machines as well as for the processing of goods. Also the machines run on the power supplied by the hydel power plants. 22 percent of the total electricity is hydro-electric power. Rapid urbanisation has led to expansion of industries which increased the requirement of water. The untreated industrial effluents which are discharged into water bodies are polluting the water and making it hazardous for human consumption. This is responsible for creating water scarcity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, multiplying urban centres with:</p>
<p>Large urban populations and</p>
<p>urban lifestyles have not only added to water and energy requirements but have further aggravated the problem by over-drawing the groundwater by using their own groundwater pumping devices for meeting their water needs for domestic purposes such as cleaning, cooking, washing, etc.</p>
<p>Thus, water resources are being over-exploited which has caused their depletion in several cities.</p>
<p>Question 9.</p>
<p>Write the adverse effects of over-exploitation of ground water resources.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Pumping out more water from under the ground may lead to falling ground water levels. It will adversely affect water availability. This, in turn, will affect our agriculture and food security of the people. Impoverishment of water resources may adversely affect the ecological cycle.</p>
<p>Question 10.</p>
<p>Write the main causes of water pollution.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Water gets polluted by:</p>
<p>Domestic wastes, especially urban sewers. Industrial wastes are disposed off in the water without proper treatment. Chemical effluents from industries and from agricultural sector. Pesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture may get washed into rivers by rain-water and may pollute the water by enriching it with minerals. Many human activities, e.g., religious rituals and immersing of idols, etc. in the water also pollute water.</p>
<p>Question 11.</p>
<p>What is the need for conservation of water resources? (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Our water resources are limited and our requirements are increasing day by day. The water resources are unevenly distributed. Most of our resources especially in the cities and urban areas are polluted and unsuitable for drinking and other purposes. To safeguard ourselves from health hazards. We need to conserve water for the continuation of our livelihoods and to prevent degradation of our natural ecosystem. To ensure food security and for continuation of our livelihoods. For productive activities of the nation. To prevent degradation of our natural ecosystem.</p>
<p>Question 12.</p>
<p>Write some measures adopted for conservation of water resources. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Measures for water conservation:</p>
<p>Do not overdraw the ground water, recharge the ground water by techniques like rainwater harvesting. Avoid wastage of water at all levels. Do not pollute the water. Increasing the water resources by tapping the rainwater in reservoirs, watershed development programmes, etc. Adopting water conserving techniques of irrigation, e.g., drip irrigation and sprinklers etc., especially in dry areas. Sufficient water percolation facilities should be increased to help in raising the level of the water table.</p>
<p>Question 13.</p>
<p>What were the different types of hydraulic structures constructed in Ancient India? Give examples.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The different types of hydraulic structures were:</p>
<p>Dams built of stone rubble e.g., during Chandragupta Maurya’s time, dams, lakes and irrigation systems were extensively built.</p>
<p>Reservoirs or lakes like the Bhopal lake of the 11th century which was one of the largest artificial lakes of its time.</p>
<p>Embankments and canals for irrigation. Sophisticated irrigation works have been found in Kalinga (Orissa), Kolhapur (Maharashtra), Nagarjunakonda (Andhra Pradesh) etc.</p>
<p>Many tanks were built to store rainwater e.g., the tank in Huaz Khas in Delhi was built in 14th century to supply water to Siri Fort area.</p>
<p>Question 14.</p>
<p>How was water conserved in ancient India? Give any four examples in support of your answer. (2012)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Archaeological and historical records show that from ancient times India has been constructing sophisticated hydraulic structures like dams, reservoirs, embankments and canals for irrigation.</p>
<p>For example, in the first century B.C., Allahabad had sophisticated water harvesting system channelling the flood water of the river Ganga. During the time of Chandragupta Maurya, dams, lakes and irrigation systems were extensively built. Sophisticated irrigation works have been found in Kalinga in Odisha, Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh, Bennur in Karnataka and Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Bhopal lake, built in the 11th century, was one of the largest artificial lakes of its time. In the 14th century, Iltutmish constructed a tank in Hauz Khas, Delhi for supplying water in Siri Fort area.</p>
<p>Question 15.</p>
<p>What is a dam? Describe the functioning of dams? On what basis are dams classified into different types?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>A dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or retards the flow, creating a reservoir, lake or impoundment.</p>
<p>A dam is the reservoir and not the whole structure.</p>
<p>Functioning:</p>
<p>Most dams have a section called spillway or weir over which or through which, water will flow intermittently or continuously.</p>
<p>Classification:</p>
<p>Dams are classified according to structure, intended purpose or height.</p>
<p>According to structure and materials used, they are classified as timber dams, embankment dams or masonry dams.</p>
<p>According to height, they are classified as large and major dams, low dams, medium height dams and high dams.</p>
<p>Question 16.</p>
<p>What is the main difference between traditional dams and modern dams?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Traditionally dams were built to impound rivers and rainwater that could be used later to irrigate the agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Today, dams are referred to as multipurpose projects where many uses of the impounded water are integrated with one another. The main purposes served by these projects are irrigation, electricity generation, flood control, water supply for domestic and industrial use, fish breeding and tourism.</p>
<p>Question 17.</p>
<p>Why are multipurpose river valley projects called ‘The Temples of Modern India’? Who first made this statement? (2014)</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Jawahar Lai Nehru proudly proclaimed the ‘dams as the temples of modern India’. Analyze this statement. (2013)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Jawahar Lai Nehru proclaimed that multipurpose projects are ‘The Temples of Modern India’, because they were thought of as the vehicle that would lead the nation to development and progress. He believed that these projects with their integrated water resource management approach would integrate development of agriculture and the village economy with rapid industrialisation and growth of the urban economy.</p>
<p>Dams or multipurpose river valley projects have the following advantages:</p>
<p>They bring water to those areas which suffer from water scarcity and also provide water for irrigation. These projects generate electricity for industries and our homes. They help in controlling floods by regulating the water flow. These projects can be used for recreation, inland navigation and fish breeding.</p>
<p>Question 18.</p>
<p>‘Construction of dams on rivers has caused environmental degradation.’ Give reasons to support this statement. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Damming of rivers affects their natural flow causing poor sediment flow. Excessive sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir. Lack of sediments results in rockier stream bed and</p>
<p>poorer habitat for the river’s aquatic life. Dams also fragment rivers, making it difficult for acquatic fauna to migrate, especially for spawning. The reservoirs submerge the existing vegetation and soil, leading to its decomposition over time. Flood plains are deprived of silt and khadar, affecting the fertility levels of the soil. Construction of dams also faces resistance because of large scale displacement of local communities.</p>
<p>Question 19.</p>
<p>Multipurpose projects and dams have been the cause of many new social movements. Name two such social movements and write the underlying causes for these movements.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Resistance to these projects came from social movements, e.g.,</p>
<p>‘Narmada Bachao Andolan’ and ‘Tehri Dam Andolan’.</p>
<p>Their major concerns were as follows: Initially the environmental concerns were of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Dams have resulted in large-scale displacement of local communities. Local people have to give up their land and livelihood. Local people do not benefit from such projects as they are even deprived of the local sources on which they have little control. Many settlements and agricultural lands are submerged under water. Rehabilitation of the displaced persons is now the prime concern of these movements.</p>
<p>Question 20.</p>
<p>What are the social consequences of multipurpose projects?</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Multipurpose projects have transformed the social landscapes. Explain.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Local people, especially the landless people, did not gain from these projects. It led to displacement of people which deprived the people of their land and livelihood. It has increased the social gap between the richer landowners and the landless poor. Dams created conflicts between people wanting different uses and benefits from the same water resources. Inter-state water disputes are also becoming common with regard to sharing the costs and benefits of the multipurpose projects.</p>
<p>Question 21.</p>
<p>Explain any three problems faced by local communities due to the construction of large dams. (2017, 2013)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Problems faced by local communities due to the construction of large dams:</p>
<p>Dams have resulted in large-scale displacement of local communities. Local people have to give up their land and livelihood. Local people do not benefit from such projects as they are even deprived of the local resources on which they have little control. Many settlements and agricultural lands are submerged under water.</p>
<p>Question 22.</p>
<p>Compare the advantages and disadvantages of multipurpose river valley projects.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<p>They bring water to those areas which suffer from water scarcity and also provide water for irrigation. These projects generate electricity for industries and our homes. They help in controlling floods by regulating the water flow. These projects can be used for recreation, inland navigation and fish breeding.</p>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<p>They have failed to achieve the purpose for which they were built. The dams that were constructed to control floods have triggered floods due to sedimentation in the reservoir. The big dams have mostly been unsuccessful in controlling floods at the time of excessive rainfall. These floods cause extensive soil erosion in addition to loss of life and property. Sedimentation deprives the flood plains of silt, a natural fertiliser. It was observed that these projects induced earthquakes. Floods cause water-borne diseases and pests. Results in pollution also. These river valley projects lead to large scale displacement of people and loss livelihoods.</p>

<p>Question 26.</p>
<p>Describe the traditional method of rainwater harvesting adopted in different parts of India.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In ancient India, people developed wide-ranging techniques to harvest rainwater.</p>
<p>In mountainous areas ‘Guls’ and ‘Kuls’ the diversion channels were built for agriculture. ‘Rooftop rainwater harvesting’ was commonly practised to store drinking water, especially in Rajasthan. Inundation channels for irrigation were developed in the flood plains of West Bengal. In arid and semi-arid regions, agricultural fields were converted into rainfed storage structures, eg. ‘Khadins’ in Jaisalmer and ‘Johads’ in other parts of Rajasthan. In semi-arid and arid regions of Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer, all the houses had underground tanks or ‘tankas’ built inside the house for storing drinking water. They were a part of the well-developed rooftop rainwater harvesting system.</p>
<p>Question 27.</p>
<p>Explain how rooftop rainwater harvesting in semi-arid regions of Rajasthan is carried out. (2012)</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Write the features of the ’tankas’ built in the houses of Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>‘Rooftop rainwater harvesting’ was commonly practiced to store drinking water, especially in semi-arid and arid regions like Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>In semi-arid and arid regions, all the houses had underground tankas or ‘tankas’ for storing drinking water built inside the house. They were the part of the well-developed rooftop rainwater harvesting system. The tankas could be as large as a big room. One household in Phalodi had a tank that was 6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44 metres wide. The tankas were built inside the main house or the courtyard. The tanks were connected to the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe. The falling rain would travel down the pipes and get stored in the underground ‘tankas’. The first spell of rain would not be collected as it cleaned the roof and pipes. The rainwater from subsequent showers was collected. Many houses constructed underground rooms adjoining the tanka to beat the summer heat as it would keep the room cool.</p>
<p>Question 28.</p>
<p>Write how modem adaptations of traditional rainwater harvesting methods are being carried out to conserve and store water.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In modem times, rainwater harvesting is done in both rural and urban areas to recharge the groundwater by capturing and storing rainwater by constructing structures, e.g., dugwells, percolation pits, digging trenches around fields, etc. Rooftop rainwater harvesting structures are a common practice in many cities. Rain-water is collected using a PVC pipe and is filtered using sand and bricks. This water can be stored to meet the household needs through storage in tanks. This water is readily available for immediate usage. Excess water or a pipe can be connected to an underground reservoir which may recharge the ground-water through hand-pump or through abandoned dugwell. Later, this water can be drawn for varied uses. Storage tanks/reservoirs are built to store rainwater which is later used for irrigation purposes.</p>

<p>Agriculture Class 10 Important Questions</p>
<p>Question 1.</p>
<p>Write four points to stress the importance of agriculture in India. (2013)</p>
<p>Or, Why is India called an agriculturally important country? Write four supportive arguments.</p>
<p>Or, ‘Agriculture has been the backbone of the Indian Economy’ Explain the statement by giving reason. (2017 D)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>India is an agricultural country because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>Two-third of its population is engaged in agricultural activities which provide livelihood. Agriculture is a primary activity and produces most of the food and foodgrains that we consume. It produces raw materials for our various industries, e.g., cotton textile and sugar industry. Some agricultural products, like tea, coffee and spices, are exported and earn foreign exchange. The share of agriculture in providing employment and livelihood to the population continued to be as high as 63% in 2001.</p>
<p>Question 2.</p>
<p>Why do farming practices vary in different regions? Give three major reasons.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Three major reasons are:</p>
<p>Physical environment, i.e., relief, soil and climate. Technological know-how. Socio-cultural practices.</p>
<p>Question 3.</p>
<p>Name some industries based on agricultural raw material.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Cotton Textile Industry and Sugar Industry.</p>
<p>Question 4.</p>
<p>What factors does primitive subsistence farming depend on?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Factors:</p>
<p>Monsoons</p>
<p>Natural fertility of the soil</p>
<p>Suitability of other environmental conditions to the crops grown.</p>
<p>Question 5.</p>
<p>Write main characteristics of ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.</p>
<p>Or, Write main characteristics of Primitive Subsistence Farming.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>This type of farming is practised in few pockets of India on small patches of land using primitive tools and family/community labour.</p>
<p>Farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food crops to sustain their families.</p>
<p>When the soil fertility decreases, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation. This type of shifting allows nature to replenish the fertility of the soil through natural processes.</p>
<p>Land productivity is low as the farmer does not use fertilisers or other modem inputs.</p>
<p>Question 6.</p>
<p>Name some primitive tools used in ‘slash and bum’ agriculture.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Tools like hoe, dao and digging sticks.</p>
<p>Question 7.</p>
<p>Compare ‘intensive subsistence farming’ with that of ‘commercial farming’ practiced in India.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Intensive Subsistence Farming Commercial Farming (i) In this type of farming, production is mainly for self consumption. (i) In this, crops are mainly grown for commercial purposes. (ii) It is practised in areas of high population pressure on land. (ii) It is practiced on large pieces of land on scientific and commercial lines. (iii) It is labour intensive farming. (iii) In this type of agriculture, machines and modem technology are used. (iv) In this, high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production. (iv) There is higher use of modern agricultural inputs, for example, High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds, fertilisers, irrigation, etc. are used to obtain higher yields and production. (v) Farmers take maximum output from the limited land by raising 2-3 crops in a year from the same land, i.e., multiple cropping is practised. (v) The degree of commercialization varies from one region to another. Rice is a commercial crop in Punjab, while in Orissa it is subsistence crop. For example, Plantation agriculture.</p>
<p>Question 8.</p>
<p>Write the main characteristics of intensive subsistence farming.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>It is practised in areas of high population pressure on land. It is labour intensive farming. Yield per hectare is high because high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used. The size of the land-holdings is small and uneconomical. Farmers take maximum output from the limited land by raising 2-3 crops in a year from the same land, i.e., multiple cropping is practised.</p>
<p>Question 9.</p>
<p>What are the major differences between primitive subsistence farming and commercial farming? (2013)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Primitive Subsistence Farming Commercial Farming 1. In this mainly cereals and other food crops are grown by farmers to sustain themselves. 1. In this, crops are mainly grown for commercial purposes. 2. It is generally done on small land holdings which are economically not viable. 2. It is practiced on large pieces of land on scientific and commercial lines. 3. Primitive tools and animals are used for carrying out agricultural activities. 3. In this type of agriculture, machines and modern technology are used. 4. In this, modern agricultural inputs, e.g., fertilisers and irrigation are not widely used. 4. There is higher use of modern agricultural in­puts, e.g., HYV seeds, fertilisers, irrigation, etc. are used to obtain higher yields and production. 5. Subsistence Agriculture is called Jhumming in Assam, Mizoram; Kuruwa in Jharkhand.E.g., Slash and Burn. 5. The degree of commercialization varies from one region to another. Rice is a commercial crop in Punjab, while in Orissa it is subsistence crop. E.g., Plantation agriculture.</p>
<p>Question 10.</p>
<p>What is the most important characteristic of commercial farming?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The main characteristic of commercial farming is the use of higher doses of modern inputs, e.g., high yielding varieties seeds (HYVs), chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase productivity.</p>
<p>The degree of commercialisation of agriculture varies from one region to another.</p>

<p>It is a Kharif crop and requires 6-8 months to mature.</p>
<p>(iii) Major cotton producing states are. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Question 40.</p>
<p>Which fibre crop is called as the ‘Golden fibre’? Which is the most important region of its growth and why? Give one major reason why it is losing the market now.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Jute is known as the golden fibre.</p>
<p>Jute is mainly grown in West Bengal, especially in the Hooghly Basin because there the geographical conditions favour its growth. These conditions are:</p>
<p>High temperature required during the time of growth.</p>
<p>Jute grows well on well-drained fertile soils in the flood plains where soils are renewed every year. Due to its high cost, it is losing market to synthetic fibres and other packing materials particularly to nylon.</p>
<p>Question 41.</p>
<p>Name the major jute producing states and list some items or products made out of jute.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Jute producing states are: West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Orissa and Meghalaya.</p>
<p>Jute products are: gunny bags, ropes, mats, carpets, yarns and other ornamental artefacts.</p>
<p>Technological And Institutional Reforms</p>
<p>Question 42.</p>
<p>Give the main reasons which have necessitated agricultural reforms.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Reforms in agriculture are necessary because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>Sustained uses of land without compatible techno-institutional changes have hindered the pace of agricultural development. Most of the farmers still depend on monsoons because large parts of the country still do not have irrigation facilities. Farmers still depend on natural fertility in order to carry on their agriculture, i.e., they lack material resources, e.g., fertilizers, etc. Ours is an agricultural economy and about 63% of people depend on agriculture for employment and livelihood, therefore reforms have to be implemented. For raising the agricultural production and productivity levels to produce sufficient food for the growing population. To overcome environmental, economic and social constraints, agricultural reforms have to be seriously implemented. The declining share in GDP is a matter of serious concern because decline and stagnation in agriculture will lead to decline in other spheres of economy.</p>
<p>Question 43.</p>
<p>What are ‘Institutional Reforms’? Enlist various institutional reforms taken by the Indian Government to bring about improvements in agriculture. (2015)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Institutional reforms:</p>
<p>Steps taken by the government to bring about improvements in agriculture are termed as ‘Institutional Reforms’.</p>
<p>Some steps are:</p>
<p>Collectivisation and consolidation of land holdings to make them economically viable. The green revolution based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution to increase milk production are important strategies which were initiated to improve agriculture. Cooperation with farmers and Abolition of Zamindari system. Provision of crop insurance to protect the farmers against losses caused by natural calamities, i.e. drought, flood, cyclone, fire and disease. Establishment of ‘Grameen Banks’, Cooperative Societies and Banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest. Kissan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the government for the benefit of farmers. Special weather bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were introduced on the Radio and TV. Announcement of minimum support price, remunerative and procurement prices for crops to check the exploitation of farmers by speculators and middlemen and removing the elements of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Question 44.</p>
<p>Describe some concerted efforts made by the government to modernise Indian agriculture and improve its share in the GDP.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The following measures have been taken by the government to modernise agriculture and improve its share in the GDP:</p>
<p>Establishment of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Setting up of Agricultural Universities. Development of advanced Veterinary Services and Animal Breeding Centres. Development of horticulture. Research and Development in the field of meteorology and weather forecasts, etc.</p>
<p>Improving the rural infrastructure is essential for the same.</p>
<p>Question 45.</p>
<p>“The contribution of agriculture to national economy is on the decline.” Write five facts to support this statement.</p>
<p>Or, What is the contribution of agriculture to national economy, employment and output? Is it declining or encouraging?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Contribution of agriculture is showing a declining trend:</p>
<p>The share of agriculture in GDP has shown a declining trend since 1951. Yet its share in providing employment and livelihood to the population continued to be as high as 63% in 2001. Although GDP growth rate of the country is increasing, it is not generating sufficient employment opportunities in the country, especially in the field of agriculture. Farmers are dragging away their investment from agriculture because they have to face big challenges from international competition. This has resulted in further downfall in employment in agriculture. The growth rate in agriculture is decelerating which is an alarming situation.</p>
<p>Question 46.</p>
<p>What are the challenges being faced by Indian farmers? What has this resulted in?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Challenges faced by Indian farmers:</p>
<p>Reduction in public investment by government in the agricultural sector particularly in areas of irrigation, power, rural roads, market and mechanisation. Subsidy on fertilizers has decreased leading to increase in the cost of production. Reduction in import duties on agricultural products has proved detrimental to agriculture in the country.</p>
<p>All these factors have led to stiff international competition. Farmers are thus withdrawing their investment from agriculture causing a downfall in agricultural employment.</p>
<p>Question 47.</p>
<p>Define each of the following:</p>
<p>(a) Green Revolution</p>
<p>(b) White Revolution</p>
<p>(c) Yellow Revolution</p>
<p>(d) Blue Revolution</p>
<p>(e) Gene Revolution.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>(a) Green Revolution. Agricultural Revolution which resulted in increased production of foodgrains because of the use of HYV (High Yielding Varieties) seeds, fertilizers, proper irrigation and other modem inputs.</p>
<p>(b) White Revolution. Revolutionary increase in the production of milk which was spearheaded by Operation Flood.</p>
<p>(c) Yellow Revolution. Increase in the output of oilseeds is termed as Yellow Revolution.</p>
<p>(d) Blue Revolution refers to increased output of fish and fish products.</p>
<p>(e) Gene Revolution refers to the development of genetically modified seeds for increasing the yield per hectare. These seeds are environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>Question 48.</p>
<p>Write four drawbacks of green revolution.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Due to overuse of chemicals land degradation has taken place. Excessive irrigation caused drying of acquifers. It became a cause for vanishing biodiversity. It has widened the gap between poor and rich farmers because only agriculturally rich areas have benefitted from it and not the small farmers.</p>
<p>Question 49.</p>
<p>(a) Give four reasons why Indian farmers should switch over from cereals to high value crops’ cultivation.</p>
<p>(b) What will be the implication of this change? Name three countries which have su

<h3 id="why-land-degradation-in-india-has-increased--and-how-to-deal-with-it">&ldquo;Why land degradation in India has increased – and how to deal with it&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/oznjmmrrgf-1538565582.jpg" alt="img">
Land degradation can exacerbate climate change and threaten agricultural productivity, water quality, biodiversity, sustainable development, and the living conditions of humans and wildlife, among other effects. Globally, a third of our land is degraded, affecting three billion people, and it is expected to worsen with rising demand for food.</p>
<p>As a signatory to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, India is committed to reducing its land degradation and desertification. In fact, India’s goal is to achieve land degradation neutral status by 2030 whereby increases in land degradation would be offset by gains in land reclamation.</p>
<p>To address this issue, ISRO’s Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad had released the results of a project in 2016 in the form of an Atlas mapping the extent of land degradation and desertification across the country, including the processes involved, the severity, and the changes in degradation. Not only does this Atlas facilitate India’s reporting to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, it also highlights vulnerable areas for mitigation to policy makers, managers, planners, and researchers.</p>
<p>The report-cum-atlas showed that during 2011-2013, the most recent time period to be quantified, 29.3% of the country was undergoing land degradation. Compared with 2003-2005, the country experienced a 0.57% increase in land degradation and more land has been degraded than reclaimed. A few states were afflicted with more than 50% of their area under desertification. The increase in degradation compared with 2003-2005, was high for Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, and the northeastern states while four states showed a drop in degradation.</p>
<p>Better regulation of lands and stepping up watershed management initiatives will help combat the rising trend of degradation, experts say.</p>
<p>What is land degradation?</p>
<p>According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, land degradation is the “reduction or loss of biological or economic productivity..resulting from land uses or from a process or combination of processes, including&hellip;human activities.” When land degradation occurs in dryland areas, more specifically arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, it is referred to as desertification. Around 69% of India falls under drylands.</p>

<p>“The universal definition is the processes of land degradation that varies with the time and space,” explained Milap Sharma, a professor at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, who was part of the project. “The basic definition of land degradation which we used to prepare the Atlas is deterioration of the original quality of land and deterioration or total loss of the production capacity of the soil.”</p>
<p>Land degradation is driven by both by changes in climate or human activities. S Dharumarajan, a scientist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning in Bengaluru, who was involved in the project, pointed out. “Overexploitation of natural resources is the main reason for increasing land degradation in India,” he said.</p>

<p>The cost of land degradation can be substantial for India where agriculture is a large contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product. As a result, lost productivity can weigh heavily on the economy. A study by Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute or TERI estimated that the economic losses from land degradation and change of land use in 2014-’15 stood at 2.54% of India’s GDP or Rs 3,177.39 billion (Rs 317,739 crore or $46.9 billion) for that year. Land degradation alone accounted for 82% of those costs.</p>
<p>Mapping degradation</p>
<p>ISRO’s Atlas maps degradation and desertification from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite Advanced Wide Field Sensor or AWiFS data at a scale of 1:500,000 during 2003-2005 and 2011-2013 for all Indian states including the processes of degradation (ie water erosion, wind erosion, etc), their severity levels, and the changes between the two time frames – a period of eight years.</p>
<p>Funded by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and led by ISRO’s Space Applications Centre, the project involved a team of almost 100 scientists and staff members from 19 state government departments and academic institutes throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Atlas classifies the type of land cover, which included forest or plantation, agriculture, grassland, scrubland, barren, rocky area, sandy area, glacial, periglacial, and others. In addition, ground truthing or field observations were performed to ascertain that the satellite images were consistent with features on the ground.</p>
<p>In the Atlas, the processes of degradation/desertification are listed as vegetation degradation from deforestation, forest-blanks, shifting cultivation and grazing or grassland; water erosion resulting in the loss of soil cover mainly due to rainfall and surface runoff water; wind erosion causing the spread of sand which can erode soil; salinity of soils in cultivated areas due to excess evapotranspiration, drought, excess irrigation, and overuse of fertilisers; waterlogging or the accumulation of standing water for long periods caused by floods, excess irrigation, and incorrect planning of drainage; frost shattering referring to the breakdown of rocks because of differences in temperature; frost heaving where ice lens form under the soil; mass movement delineating the movement of masses of soil and rock due to gravity; and manmade causes such as mining, quarrying, brick kilns, industrial effluents, city waste, and urban agglomeration. These are further classified into their level of severity, either high or low.</p>

<p>Increase in degradation and desertification India-wide</p>
<p>In 2011-2013, India’s land degradation area totaled 29.3% of India’s total land area, representing an area of 96.4 million hectares. This is an increase of 0.57% compared with 2003-2005, which amounts to 1.87 mha – an area larger than the state of Nagaland. Although 1.95 mha of land was reclaimed or restored between 2003-2005 and 2011-2013, 3.63 mha of productive land degraded during this period.</p>
<p>“Land reclamation is bringing back the degraded land into its former state by adopting suitable management practices,” explained Dharumarajan.</p>

<p>The top processes leading to degradation/desertification in the country in both time periods were water erosion (10.98% in 2011-2013) followed by vegetation degradation (8.91%) and wind erosion (5.55%). Overall, the areas affected by vegetation and water erosion increased by 1.02 mha and 0.49 mha respectively in 2011-2013, while there was a slight drop in the total area degraded due to wind erosion and salinity, indicating improvement.</p>

<p>The area under desertification (dryland areas) was 82.64 mha in 2011-2013, which rose by 1.16 mha from 2003-2005. While wind erosion was the main process leading to desertification in the arid regions, vegetation degradation and water erosion dominated in the semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions.</p>
<p>Land degradation increased in most states</p>
<p>In terms of India’s total geographical area, the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka have the highest area of lands undergoing degradation/desertification, amounting to 18.4% (out of India’s total 29.3%) while all the other states each had less than 2% of degraded lands.</p>

<p>But when considering the area within the states, Jharkhand followed by Rajasthan, Delhi, Gujarat, and Goa, had the highest area of degraded lands, representing more than 50% of their area. In comparison, the land area undergoing degradation/desertification in Kerala, Assam, Mizoram, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Arunachal Pradesh was less than 10%.</p>
<p>Sharma explained that Rajasthan and Gujarat are large states with desert regions featuring an arid climate while “Delhi and Goa are comparatively smaller states, but overexploitation leads to a higher area under desertification.”</p>
<p>Overall, land degradation/desertification in 87% of 30 states increased from 2003-2005 to 2011-2013. Four states, however, improved slightly in their degradation status over the eight-year period. Among these, Uttar Pradesh had the highest restoration of 1.27%, mainly due to a drop in salinity, while the other three – Rajasthan, Odisha, and Telangana – improved by less than 1%.</p>

<p>Delhi had the third highest level of desertification (60.60% of the state) in the country and it also experienced the highest increase in land degradation (+11.03% ) over the eight-year period from 2003-2005. “In the case of Delhi it is not strictly desertification, but prime land degradation arising from settlement growth, which turns productive areas into non-productive ones,” explained Sharma.</p>
<p>Desertification in the northern states such as Himachal Pradesh (+4.55%) and Jammu &amp; Kashmir (+1.94% ) rose more compared with the eastern states such as Bihar and West Bengal both of which experienced an increase of less than 1% in land degradation. According to Sharma, the “harsh climate and hilly terrains in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu &amp; Kashmir are dominated by physical processes” such as slope erosion, mass-movement, and frost shattering.</p>
<p>The northeast part of the country had notably large increases in land degradation over the eight years from 2003-2005. Land degradation in the states of Nagaland, Tripura, and Mizoram shot up by 8.71%, 10.47%, and 4.34% respectively. In fact, Tripura and Nagaland had the second and third highest increase in degradation country-wide. The driving force for the sharp rise in these states was mainly because of a surge in vegetal degradation of forests.</p>
<p>This may be linked to “low or lack of watershed management interventions in the region from the beginning,” said V Ratna Reddy, Director of Livelihoods and Natural Resource Management Institute who was the author of a 2003 article on land degradation in India.</p>
<p>In contrast to the north and northeast, degradation/desertification in the southern states rose by less than 1% from 2003-2005 to 2011-2013. Dharumarajan explains that “unlike the northern states like Rajasthan or Gujarat” that feature arid climates, “southern states are mostly under semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions where the land degradation process is low.” But he warns that recently “due to overexploitation of land resources and mismanagement, desertification/land degradation processes in the southern states are growing at a faster rate.”</p>

<p>Among the southern states, Telangana showed an improvement in the area undergoing degradation/desertification by 0.52%. This is mainly because of a drop in the area of un-irrigated agricultural lands featuring low severity of water erosion, which is influenced by land management practices, says Dharumarajan. “But the main problem in Telangana is increasing salinity which is due to bringing non-conventional areas into irrigated agriculture,” he adds.</p>
<p>Varying degradation estimates and definitions</p>
<p>Surinder S. Kukal, a professor and dean of the College of Agriculture at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, said that the current estimation of land degradation at 29.3% is much lower compared with an earlier 1994 estimate of 57% by the National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning.</p>
<p>This variation, according to Dharumarajan, arises due to differences in methodologies and definitions. The earlier estimate was likely based on extrapolation of sample surveys but the most recent figure is based on high-resolution remote sensing data, he points out.</p>
<p>Kukal has some concerns about the classification of the processes of degradation. He points out that the process of vegetation degradation leads to water and wind erosion. In other words, “the water and wind erosion are the outcomes of vegetation depletion.” And, although manmade degradation is stated separately in the Atlas, he believes that most land degradation is manmade.</p>
<p>Rampant salinity and alkalinity in tank and canal irrigated areas. Development of salinity and alkalinity in Bukkarayasamudhrum, Anantapur district. Photo credit: S. Dharumarajan.</p>
<p>“It all started when nomad humans started animal and crop husbandry by destroying natural vegetation to pave the way for present-day agricultural lands,” he stated. The best example, he says, is the practice of shifting cultivation in the northeast. Man-made degradation continues until today, he asserts, with agricultural lands being converted into settlements, industries, and highways.</p>
<p>“The impact of land degradation varies with time and space. It depends on the intensity and amount of rains which cause soil erosion by water,” Kukal says. “The increase/decrease in area under land degradation does not matter anymore because of the severity of various components of land degradation. The mudslides in Jammu &amp; Kashmir (Ladakh) and Uttarakhand during the last few years are sufficient to remind us that things are going from bad to worse every year,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the mudslides, explained Kukal, is “deforestation in the catchment areas of many natural and manmade reservoirs,” which “has led to their decreased capacity to hold water in them due to unabated soil erosion by water in the catchment areas.”</p>
<p>Reclaiming degraded lands</p>
<p>So what needs to be done to reclaim degraded lands?</p>
<p>According to Reddy, to combat soil loss by water erosion, which is the largest process leading to land degradation in India, and to restore degraded lands, there is a need to initiate watershed interventions immediately. Watershed management initiatives include afforestation and other programmes aimed at conserving soil and water.</p>
<p>“Watershed management has been dropped from the priority of natural resource management initiatives over the past five years at the national and state levels,” Reddy noted. “This is not a good sign for NRM [natural resource management], given that water erosion is on the rise. Systematic implementation of watershed interventions should be a long-term priority in order to check soil erosion, improve soil moisture, increase recharge, stabilise river basins (catchments) and making agriculture and communities climate resilient.”</p>
<p>Indeed, “watershed management programmes have greatly helped restore degraded lands in Himachal Pradesh,” noted Sharma, citing a case where the state forest department along with the panchayat-level watershed development group planted trees in vulnerable areas, which have resulted in large positive changes over the past two to three decades.</p>
<p>According to Dharumarajan, reducing the severity of degradation/desertification can be achieved by establishing a “proper land use policy, protection of prime agricultural lands and regular monitoring of highly vulnerable areas.”</p>
<p>Kukal also stressed the importance of implementing a strict “land use change policy” at the state level. “Anybody can convert agricultural land into a settlement colony, anybody can install a factory on agricultural land,” he stated, noting that this problem was rampant in Punjab.</p>
<p>In order to reduce soil erosion by water, he proposed harvesting of rain/runoff water – a watershed management practice – stressing that “this needs to be a part of our policy both in urban as well as rural areas.”</p>
<p>“The harvested water could be stored in reservoirs at the individual or community level or used for recharging the groundwater depending on the situation. Every household needs to be sensitised for rooftop rainwater harvesting. The best example of this is Junagarh area of Gujarat, where even the small houses have rainwater harvesting reservoirs, the water of which is used for all household chores including drinking purposes,” he elaborates.</p>
<p>The period of time required to reclaim degraded lands can be lengthy. “If restoration work is scientifically initiated and properly executed, it will take approximately 25-30 years for a visible restoration. But in some areas such as housing colonies may not be possible to restore within such time limits,” said Sharma.</p>

<p>What’s next?</p>
<p>“This Atlas was prepared using visual image interpretation that may vary from eye to eye,” said Sharma. “Therefore, there is some inconsistency in mapping and identification in terms of intensity.”</p>
<p>Also, Dharumarajan points out that the Atlas “only helps for state-level planning.” To prepare a degradation combating plan at the district or village-level, he says, we need to map land degradation at a finer scale.</p>
<p>Around 78 vulnerable districts were selected for detailed mapping at a scale of 1: 50,000, which Dharumarajan says is better for preparing combating plans aimed at afforestation and conserving soil and water. These districts have already been mapped. Semiautomatic techniques were used for mapping the districts, said Sharma. In the next step, such high-resolution mapping and analysis would be carried out for all districts in India, he adds.</p>
