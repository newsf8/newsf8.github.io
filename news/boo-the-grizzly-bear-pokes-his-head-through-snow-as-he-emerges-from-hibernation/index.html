Boo makes an appearance (Picture: grizzlygirl84/Instagram)</p>
<p>A huge grizzly bear named Boo has been captured on camera emerging from hibernation in Canada.</p>
<p>Incredibly rare footage shows the animal shaking snow from his fur as he pads into the sunshine for the first time this year.</p>
<p>In a video which has since gone viral, Nicole Gangnon – who manages a refuge near Golden, in the Canadian Rockies – films Boo poking his head out before he fully gets up.</p>
<p>Watching from within the 20-acre enclosure at the Kicking Horse ski resort, Nicole is beside herself, shouting: ‘Eight years it took me to catch this moment! Oh, my big boy! Mumma’s so proud of you!’</p>
<p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video</p>
<p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk after the March 17 arrival, she explained: ‘He typically emerges mid March, so I knew any day he would be up.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘I was working near the den (and) I could hear him stir inside his den.</p>
<p>‘I heard him start to tunnel out through the snow… That’s when I grabbed my cell phone and got on top of the roof of his den and began filming.’</p>
<p>Nicole has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a decade to capture such a scene, with the log cabin under the snow where Boo hibernates also serving as a makeshift laboratory that can be used to learn about bears.</p>
<p>After his mum was killed by poachers in 2002, Boo arrived at the refuge with brother Cari, who died during their first winter at the refuge.</p>

<p>Boo came to the refuge with his brother who died in the pair’s first winter together (Picture: grizzlygirl84/Instagram)</p>
<p>But since then Boo has fascinated thousands of tourists at his enclosure.</p>
<p>Recalling when she first saw him this year, Nicole continued: ‘He knew I was there.</p>
<p>‘He can hear and even smell his surroundings even though he is under all that snow. Bears can smell about 2 metres through the snow and their nose is their best sense.</p>
<p>‘He is comfortable around me as I am one of his two primary caregivers, so he had no issues popping out with me right there.’</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>She added: ‘We have surveillance inside his den and can see his activity.</p>
<p>‘Bears are not true hibernators and the dormant state they enter is known as Torpor.</p>
<p>‘Hears will drop their heart beats to a mere eights beats per minute.</p>
<p>‘How incredible. They are truly remarkable at survival.’</p>

Ranger in Canadian Rockies says video she captured was ‘something everybody needed’ in a time of isolation</p>
<p>On a bright spring day, a hulking grizzly bear named Boo emerged from his winter den, shaking a dusting of snow from his thick coat as he looked around groggily.</p>
<p>The moment was filmed in a remarkable viral video – which also captures the elated reaction of one of the bear’s closest humans, the manager of grizzly refuge in the Canadian Rockies.</p>
<p>“Mama’s so proud of you! You are such a good sight,” exclaims Nicole Gangnon, in a clip filmed on her mobile phone which has racked up more 100,000 views on Twitter – many by people desperate for distraction from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Gangnon had her own reason to be cheerful, she later explained: she had tried unsuccessfully for eight years to document the bear’s emergence from hibernation.</p>
<p>“We’ve always set up trail cameras and our surveillance cameras,” Gangnon told the Guardian. “And it just seems like every time he decides to dig out, our technology fails us and we can never capture that moment.”</p>

<p>Born in the wild, Boo now lives alone at the Grizzly Bear Refuge, a 20-acre enclosure on the property of the Kicking Horse ski resort in near the town of Golden.</p>
<p>After his mother was killed by poachers nearly in 2002, Boo arrived at the refuge with his brother Cari (the pair were named after the Cariboo Mountains where they were found).</p>
<p>Cari died from a twisted intestine during the pair’s first winter in the refuge, but Boo has thrived over the years, drawing thousands of tourists to his enclosure.</p>
<p>The log cabin den where Boo sleeps every winter – buried under two meters of snow – also doubles as makeshift laboratory and is designed to allow researchers to study bear hibernation.</p>
<p>On 17 March, Gangnon heard movement from the den and waited anxiously as Boo dug himself out.</p>
<p>“It’s just beautiful to see him face-to-face rather than on a camera. He’s so happy and that just makes your heart sing,” she said. “Once he gets up, you can see he’s got a grin on his face. He’s like: ‘Hello, world, here I am again.’”</p>
<p>“I was moved to tears that day. With the world so uncertain, it was something I needed. I think it was something everybody needed, to be honest,” said Gangnon. “It’s brought a lot of happiness into people’s world’s right now, when people are isolated. It’s really just helped people to see that the world will still go on.”</p>

FILE PHOTO: The Wall St. Bull is seen standing on a nearly empty Broadway in the financial district, as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak continues, in New York</p>
<p>By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Noel Randewich</p>
<p>NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors could be forgiven for doing a double-take: Wait, we&rsquo;re back in a bull market?</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average&rsquo;s surge of over 20% from its coronavirus-induced recent low this week, by one definition used on Wall Street, suggests a new bull market. The surge came on hopes a $2 trillion stimulus measure would flood the country with cash in a bid to counter the economic impact of the intensifying pandemic.</p>
<p>But that definition should be treated with a large piece of caution. The very definition of bull market is debatable, and given the market&rsquo;s volatility on news about the pandemic, some said that calling the move upwards a &ldquo;bull market&rdquo; was tantamount to missing the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Labeling it a bull market when it fits a definition of being up 20% kind of removes any perspective from where we have been over the past month, and more importantly, where we might be going over the next few months,&rdquo; said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Robert W. Baird.</p>
<p>Other definitions say the index should crest the previous high and that a bull market can only be identified a long time after the event.</p>
<p>For example, a mini-bull market has occurred previously during a bear market - providing a false hope of relief. The S&amp;P 500 logged a gain of 24% over a period of 30 trading days starting on Nov. 20, 2008, even as the bear market continued during the height of the financial crisis, and the index did not bottom till March 9, 2009, marking the start of the bull market.</p>
<p>Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, said that while there is consensus about the definition of a bear market - a 20% decline from a peak - the definition of a bull market is less widely agreed upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bull markets occur between bear markets,&rdquo; Yardeni said.</p>
<p>Part of the confusion about whether the Dow is indeed out of the bear market is because while one group is widely recognized for determining U.S. economic cycles - the National Bureau of Economic Research - no such body is uniformly accepted for defining bull and bear markets.</p>
<p>Analysts warn against putting too much stock in strict definitions of market cycles. Factors like the velocity of the market’s rise or fall, how much average stocks have changed, and the reasons behind the moves also contribute to whether investors view a major move as a turning point in sentiment or a short-term interruption to an existing bull or bear market.</p>
<p>Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices in New York, said he still sees the Dow in a bear market. The Dow would need to hit 29,551.42, the high of Feb. 12, to be technically in a bull market, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep going up, eventually we could have a bull, but until it hits the record, it&rsquo;s a bull run in a bear market,&rdquo; Silverblatt said.</p>
