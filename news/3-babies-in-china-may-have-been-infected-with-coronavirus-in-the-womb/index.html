Three babies in China may have contracted the new coronavirus in the womb shortly before birth, according to two new reports.</p>
<p>However, experts say the evidence in these cases is inconclusive and does not prove the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can pass from mother to child during pregnancy .</p>
<p>In one report, doctors from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, describe the case of a woman who gave birth several weeks after she was hospitalized for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The baby girl was delivered by cesarean section , and the mother wore an N95 mask and did not hold the infant, according to the report, published today (March 26) in the journal JAMA . The newborn was immediately quarantined, but showed no symptoms.</p>
<p>Two hours after birth, tests showed the baby had elevated levels of two types of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 . These antibodies are known as IgG and IgM. Although IgG antibodies are known to pass from mother to child during pregnancy, IgM antibodies are too large to cross the placenta, according to an editorial accompanying the report . Thus &ldquo;detection in a newborn reasonably could be assumed to reflect fetal production following in utero infection,&rdquo; the editorial said.</p>
<p>The infant also had increased levels of immune system chemicals called cytokines, as well as white blood cells, which can be signs of infection.</p>
<p>But critically, the baby repeatedly tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself. This means it&rsquo;s unclear if the baby was ever really infected with the virus, or if there could be another explanation for the positive IgM result.</p>
<p>In a second report, also published in JAMA on March 26, doctors from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University analyzed blood samples from six newborns, looking for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. They found five infants had elevated levels of IgG, and two infants had elevated levels of IgM, like the baby in the first report. But none of these infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>One explanation besides SARS-CoV-2 infection could be that the mothers&rsquo; placentas were damaged or abnormal in some way, allowing IgM antibodies to pass through the placenta to the infants, the authors from Zhongnan Hospital wrote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that IgM tests can be prone to both false positive and false negative results, and are not typically used to diagnose infections acquired in utero, according to the editorial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although these two studies deserve careful evaluation, more definitive evidence is needed before the provocative findings they report can be used to counsel pregnant women that their fetuses are at risk from congenital infection with SARS-CoV-2,&rdquo; the editorial concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a baby in London reportedly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 minutes after being born to a mother with COVID-19, Live Science previously reported. However, in that case, it&rsquo;s still unclear if the virus passed to the infant during or immediately after birth.</p>
<p>In addition, a preliminary study of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 passing from mother to child in the womb, Live Science previously reported.</p>

<h3 id="why-official-coronavirus-statistics-are-misleading----and-dangerous">Why official coronavirus statistics are misleading &ndash; and dangerous</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200323174909-coronavirus-tests-turkey-0323-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Why is the death rate so low in Germany ? How come the UK has comparatively fewer cases than elsewhere? And what&rsquo;s going on in Russia ?</p>
<p>But what if the numbers aren&rsquo;t painting the full picture?</p>
<p>For people who are comparing the data and attempting to divine how different countries&rsquo; epidemics stack up against each other, experts have a warning: nations have different reporting standards, different approaches to testing, and different approaches to tracing cases, all of which makes such comparisons dangerously misleading.</p>
<p>Sheila Bird, a renowned British biostatistician and professor at Cambridge University, says testing and reporting have been inconsistent even within individual countries, let alone internationally. Rules on who gets tested &ndash; and where and when &ndash; can evolve, and these changes and time lapses are not necessarily captured in the data published by different governments.</p>
<p>Bird is one of a number of high-profile scientists who have been calling on the UK government to run more coronavirus tests and provide more nuanced data. The UK government says the health system doesn&rsquo;t currently have the capacity to test everyone who has Covid-19 symptoms. Only patients sick enough to require hospital treatment get tested, according to the government. The country had more than 9,962 cases and 467 deaths as of Thursday, according to JHU.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Germany, anyone who shows flu-like symptoms and has in the past 14 days come into contact with a confirmed case, or traveled to a high-risk region, gets tested, according to official guidelines published by the health ministry. According to JHU, more than 41,519 people there have tested positive as of Thursday, with just 239 deaths</p>
<p>And in South Korea, there is free and easy access to testing for anyone whom a doctor deems needs it, and authorities have been tracing the contacts of infected patients. As of Wednesday, the country had 9,241 cases and 131 deaths, according to JHU.</p>
<p>The relatively low number of tests done in the UK helps explain why the case numbers appear so much lower in the JHU map compared to other European countries. It doesn&rsquo;t mean fewer people are sick, necessarily &ndash; just that fewer people are being tested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The danger is relying on the figures and assuming that they give us an accurate count of the total number of people who have been infected,&rdquo; said Mike Tildesley, an associate professor at Warwick University.</p>
<p>The lack of testing could also make the situation look worse than it is. Based on the number of confirmed cases and reported deaths, the UK appears to have a relatively high Covid-19 mortality rate. But that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case, because in the UK, only those who are very ill get tested. People with mild symptoms, who are very likely to recover , are being told to stay home without being tested &ndash; meaning they&rsquo;re not being captured by the data.</p>
<p>Internationally, the comparisons rely on a piecemeal of different sources. The JHU map, which has become the go-to resource for many media organizations and experts, pulls in data from the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control and China&rsquo;s national health commission, in addition to local media reports, health departments, and the online community for health care professionals known as DXY.</p>
<p>Bird said comparing such numbers could be dangerous. &ldquo;Lacking assured like-with-like comparators in other countries, we risk making heroic, and perhaps heroically wrong, inferences country-to-country,&rdquo; she told CNN in an email.</p>
<p>Tildesley, who specializes in developing mathematical models to simulate the spread of diseases, said people need to be mindful of the bigger picture. &ldquo;The fear is that people may look at their own risk, consider it&rsquo;s low and then not take the measures that are being advised,&rdquo; he said. His advice: Even though the likelihood of any one individual in the UK being infected is very low at the moment, everyone should behave as if they were.</p>
<p>Rather than focus too much on the actual numbers, scientists spend a lot of time looking at the epidemic curve &ndash; the shape of the graph that captures the total number of new cases in each country day by day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If different nations have different standards and conditions, they at least generate a consistent curve if those standards and conditions are stable across time,&rdquo; said Lisa Gitelman, an NYU professor and the editor of a book called &lsquo;&ldquo;Raw Data&rsquo; Is an Oxymoron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, if Italy keeps testing people at similar rate and its daily rate of increase in new cases starts going down &ndash; the curve starts flattening &ndash; that&rsquo;s good news. But the testing rate needs to stay the same. If the UK suddenly starts testing many more people and sees a big jump in new cases, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the epidemic is spreading faster. Similarly, if a country runs out of tests, it may suddenly report a misleading drop in new cases.</p>
<p>Accurate information is important, because to defeat the virus, people need to be willing to comply with strict restrictions. Scientists say the only way to defeat the virus is through social distancing , which requires citizens to drastically alter their way of life.</p>
<p>Martin Hibberd, a professor of emerging infectious disease at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the UK government&rsquo;s figures &ldquo;may make some people think there are not many cases.&rdquo; He said that&rsquo;s why the associated messaging is important. &ldquo;Gaining compliance will then depend on convincing people that their actions impact the numbers going forward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the containment restrictions are increased, we should expect to see an impact on the numbers &ndash; the forward predictions should change &ndash; and people can be convinced that their actions matter,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The reproduction number &ndash; showing the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to &ndash; is a key metric when looking at the success of the restrictive measures. Early data indicates that social distancing measures really help to curb the disease from spreading, according to a study published in The Lancet on Wednesday. The Czech Ministry of Health released preliminary data on Tuesday that suggest that while the initial reproduction number in the Czech Republic stood at 2.64, this went down to 1.84 after March 12, when movement restrictions came into place.</p>
<p>To convince people to obey the rules, politicians need to make a convincing case that the situation is serious enough to merit such sacrifices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately there is no one metric that enables us to compare situations in different countries,&rdquo; Tildesley said. Looking at the number of deaths gives some indication about the severity of the situation in each country, but international comparisons are again complicated. No two countries are alike when it comes to access to healthcare and medical resources, underlying health conditions and even the age structure of the population.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The number of deaths may be higher in different countries if there are not the same level of resources for treatment as in other countries, so it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the disease is spreading in a different way or the controls are less effective,&rdquo; Tildesley added.</p>
<p>Having more complete data on the number of all recoveries would be helpful. Scientists are hoping that a widespread testing for antibodies, which should become available at least in some countries in the coming days, would reveal who has had the illness in the past and help paint a more accurate picture of the epidemic.</p>
<p>But even when the numbers are accurate, they may be hard to comprehend. &ldquo;Data is useful, but I think the most important thing is looking at the experience in other countries,&rdquo; said Nick Chater, a professor of behavioral science at Warwick Business School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the UK, the government&rsquo;s projections are that in a good scenario, 20,000 people die &hellip; but that&rsquo;s very hard to make sense of until you realize what&rsquo;s happening in Italy now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are 6,000 deaths, and if you look at what it&rsquo;s like to be dealing with the healthcare disaster there, it&rsquo;s clearly absolutely terrible, and anything that&rsquo;s much worse than that is clearly really really terrible. It&rsquo;s these comparisons that bring the data alive.&rdquo;

<p>US cases have topped 75,000 , according to figures from JHU, and the number of deaths has risen above 1,000 . Officials are racing to get a handle on the coronavirus as cases in two of the hardest hit states &ndash; California and New York &ndash; quickly multiply. Two people who were passengers on the Grand Princess cruise ship have died.</p>
<p>A tidal wave of coronavirus patients is threatening to overwhelm hospitals worldwide. Public health experts have warned the US could &ldquo;become Italy,&rdquo; where doctors have been forced to ration careNew York state has approved the splitting of ventilators to allow one machine to serve two patients. Dyson &ndash; a company best known for hand dryers and vacuum cleaners &ndash; is helping to provide the UK government with 10,000 ventilators.</p>
<p>Rise of the volunteers: In New York, 40,000 retired medical workers have volunteered to help, along with 8,600 mental health professionals. In the UK, more than In New York, 40,000 retired medical workers have volunteered to help, along with 8,600 mental health professionals. In the UK, more than half a million people responded to the government&rsquo;s call to volunteer for the National Health Service (NHS). Away from the fights at grocery stores, people have been finding ways to help their neighbors by distributing food to hospital workers and offering remote tutoring services.</p>
<p>Largest 24-hour spike in several nations: The US, Japan, Singapore, New Zealand, Malaysia and Russia saw their largest single-day spike in cases since the outbreak began. New Zealand is now on the highest Level 4 alert and most people are required to stay home. Prime Minister The US, Japan, Singapore, New Zealand, Malaysia and Russia saw their largest single-day spike in cases since the outbreak began. New Zealand is now on the highest Level 4 alert and most people are required to stay home.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern warned of a possible sharp rise in cases during a Facebook Live she hosted from her home, adding: &ldquo;Remember stay at home, break the chain, and you&rsquo;ll save lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>G20 to do whatever it takes: The G20 said it would spare no effort to protect lives, safeguard people&rsquo;s jobs and preserve financial stability. Members have committed to injecting over $5 trillion into the global economy, its leaders said in a statement. It also gave support to the &ldquo;extraordinary measures&rdquo; taken by central banks and bodies like the IMF and World Bank.

A push by the US State Department to include the phrase &quot; Wuhan virus &quot; in a joint statement with other G7 members following a meeting of foreign ministers on coronavirus on Wednesday was rejected, resulting in separate statements and division in the group.</p>
<p>Spain reels: The country has now recorded more The country has now recorded more deaths than China &ndash; only Italy has more. The total number of infections in Spain has topped 56,000 , with more than 4,000 fatalities. But the rise in the death toll of 655 in the past 24 hours was a smaller increase than the record 738 set on Wednesday, with officials tentatively noting signs of a peak in the data. Spain has been locked down and in a state of emergency since March 13 and has appealed to NATO for humanitarian assistance, requesting medical and personal protective equipment. It has ordered $467 million worth of masks, tests, gloves and respirators from China.</p>
<p>Markets struggling: US stocks opened higher on Thursday, suggesting the market had already priced in a shock to the labor market as the nation moves closer toward passing a stimulus bill. The House of Representatives is expected to take up the measure on Friday. Markets in Asia Pacific struggled for direction, and Australia&rsquo;s S&amp;P/ASX 200 was the only major benchmark in the region to trade firmly in the green.</p>
<p>New imported cases in China: The country reported 67 new imported coronavirus cases on Wednesday, but no new locally transmitted ones. Its rate of new infections has slowed significantly, with 81,285 cases, 3,287 deaths, 74,051 recovered.</p>
<p>Mixed messages from Kremlin as cases spiral: President Vladimir Putin has declared next week a paid stay-at-home holiday in Russia. All cafes, parks and stores (except grocery stores, delivery kitchens and pharmacies) will President Vladimir Putin has declared next week a paid stay-at-home holiday in Russia. All cafes, parks and stores (except grocery stores, delivery kitchens and pharmacies) will shut in Moscow until April 5 after a spike in Russia took the nation to 840 cases and three deaths. Putin said last week Russia had managed to slow the spread of coronavirus thanks to early and aggressive measures. Now the country is changing tactics, as authorities acknowledge they are gearing up for a major Covid-19 outbreak</p>
<p>India pledges $22.6 billion in support: The government has announced a relief The government has announced a relief package to assist those most affected by the pandemic and 21-day nationwide lockdown. It includes medical insurance cover of $66,400 per person to those working on the frontlines and 5 kilograms of rice or wheat per month for 800 million people.
