TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Czech news site on Monday (March 23) revealed that 80 percent of the much-touted traunch of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) rapid test kits &ldquo;donated&rdquo; from China are faulty, forcing healthcare workers to rely on conventional laboratory tests.</p>
<p>On March 18, as is the case with many of its other quasi charitable acts, Chinese state-run mouthpieces used the verbs &ldquo;supplied&rdquo; and &ldquo;delivered&rdquo; to give the impression that the communist regime was donating 150,000 portable, rapid COVID-19 test kits to the Czech Republic. In fact, the central European nation&rsquo;s Health Ministry paid some 14 million crowns (US$546,000) for 100,000 test kits, while the country&rsquo;s Interior Ministry footed the bill for another 50,000, reported Expats.cz.</p>
<p>However, Czech news site iROZHLAS on Monday revealed that local healthcare workers have discovered that up to 80 percent of the Chinese kits give false results. During a crisis staff meeting held for the Moravian-Silesian Region by regional hygienist Pavla Svrcinova, the error rate for the test kits was found to be 80 percent, prompting officials to suggest they only be used for those persons who are nearing the end of their quarantine and never previously tested positive.</p>
<p>According to Svrcinova, the Moravian-Silesian Region will continue to rely on conventional laboratory testing instead. Currently, only 900 such tests can be processed each day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We checked them at the University Hospital in Ostrava, but unfortunately the error rate was quite high. So now we are waiting for the results of further testing across the country, and we are considering using them only with people reach the end of their quarantine and have never tested positive, because it works with antibodies,&rdquo; said Svrcinova.</p>
<p>She added that the tests yield both false positive and negative results. &ldquo;We tested those who searched for a sampling point. Fortunately, we were so farsighted that samples were immediately compared with traditional tests, and that just proved the error rate of the [Chinese rapid] tests, ”said Svrcinova. She said that even if the tests are used with patients who are nearing the end of their quarantine, healthcare workers will need to check their reliability first.</p>
<p>However, Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (CSSD) said that the wrong methodology has probably been chosen. &ldquo;In my opinion, this is not about some scandalous revelation that it is not working,&rdquo; said Hamacek after a government meeting.</p>
<p>According to Hamacek, the Chinese rapid test kits can be &ldquo;used when the disease has been around for some time,&rdquo; &ldquo;or if someone returns after quarantine after fourteen days,&rdquo; he added. The leader said that in his opinion, it would be most appropriate to use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (conventional lab test) to detect the disease at an early stage.</p>
<p>University of Warsaw professor Andrej Kozlowski was one of the first to share the news in English on social media when he posted this tweet on Tuesday (March 24):

Home-testing kits which indicate whether you have ever been infected with the coronavirus will soon be rolled out across the UK, Members of Parliament have been told.</p>
<p>Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, said the group had developed simple finger-prick tests which could soon be available.</p>
<p>The tests could be available in chemists and online retailers like Amazon once they have been tested by the UK authorities.</p>
<p>However, the UK government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser said the testing process could significantly delay their rollout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one thing worse than no test is a bad test,&rdquo; the UK&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said.</p>
<p>If effective the tests could mean that thousands of workers can return to normal life much sooner than expected.</p>

<p>Simple home-testing kits which indicate whether somebody has ever been infected with the coronavirus could soon be available to order in the UK, Members of Parliament have been told.</p>
<p>Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, told the UK parliament on Wednesday that the group had developed finger-prick tests which establish whether a person has ever been infected with the virus.</p>
<p>Once rolled out, the public will be able to buy the tests via services like Amazon and in high-street pharmacists, Peacock said. Users will carry out the pin-prick test, then send the sample to a laboratory.</p>
<p>She said it would initially allow key workers, particularly NHS staff, to return to work after their illness, as they would have developed immunity to the virus, but confirmed they would be available to the wider population soon afterwards.</p>
<p>Peacock said that the tests were currently being evaluated to confirm whether they worked, which she said would happen by the end of the week, after which &ldquo;several million&rdquo; would be rolled out across the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we are assured that they do work, they will be rolled out into the community,&rdquo; Peacock told the Health &amp; Science select committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Testing the test is a small matter, and I anticipate that it will be done by the end of this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the near future people will be able to order a test that they can test themselves, or go to Boots, or somewhere similar to have their finger prick test done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked if she meant the tests would be ready for roll-out within days rather than weeks, she said: &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the UK&rsquo;s own medical advisers downplayed the possibility of a rapid roll-out, saying that they needed to be properly tested first.</p>
<p>The UK government&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that full testing would need to be completed on the tests first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one thing worse than no test is a bad test,&rdquo; Whitty said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think, and I want to be clear, that this is something we&rsquo;ll be ordering from the internet in a matter of weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to go through the evaluation, then the first critical uses, and then spread it out from that point of view. We need to do that in a systematic way.&rdquo;

<h3 id="how-can-i-get-tested-for-coronavirus-what-you-should-know-about-test-kits">How can I get tested for coronavirus? What you should know about test kits</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/06/USAT/20bfb925-cd0c-491d-89dc-86c9dcf711d5-AFP_AFP_1PN9U6.JPG?crop=5936,3339,x0,y0&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
As coronavirus continues its spread across the U.S., public health officials are racing to make more test kits available and laboratories are working around the clock to test for the virus that has killed more than a dozen people in the U.S. and infected more than 230.</p>
<p>The federal agency in charge of testing efforts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is under fire for what one top national health official told CNN Friday were &ldquo;missteps&rdquo; that slowed efforts to contain the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said testing by the CDC got off to a &ldquo;slow start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about coronavirus test kits:</p>
<p>How do I get a coronavirus test?</p>
<p>If you’re not quarantined on an air base or cruise ship, the only way to get a coronavirus test is through a healthcare professional, according to the National Institutes of Health website.</p>
<p>If you have a fever, develop virus symptoms, have recently traveled to an area with an ongoing spread of the virus or have come into contact with a person who is known to have it, call your doctor. You may be asked to wear a mask to the office.</p>
<p>If your doctor thinks you might have the coronavirus, he or she will contact the CDC or your local health department for instructions on testing.</p>
<p>How many coronavirus test kits does the US have?</p>
<p>Fauci told ABC News Sunday there are 75,000 virus test kits in the United States, but that number will &ldquo;radically&rdquo; increase in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Vice President MIke Pence said the U.S. did not have enough tests &ldquo;to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.&rdquo; But the vice president said kits for 1.2 million should be available next week, the BBC reported</p>
<p>How many labs are doing the tests?</p>
<p>According to the Association of Public Health Laboratories, there are 69 local and state public health labs that cover 46 states, including Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The five states that await lab verification are Wyoming, Oklahoma, Alabama, Ohio and West Virginia. There are 12 additional labs in the verification progress, three of which should be testing by the weekend.</p>
<p>When all the selected labs have been verified, there will be 100 local and state public health labs testing, with a potential testing capacity of 10,000 tests per day.</p>
<p>A few private companies are also testing.</p>
<p>LabCorp developed its own test and began testing Thursday. According to the company, the new test detects the presence of the underlying virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>Quest Diagnostics said it can start receiving samples from doctors for testing on Monday. It’s unclear if only select labs or all labs will be testing. The company didn’t immediately respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment.</p>
<p>What is a presumptive positive test?</p>
<p>Now that state and some local public health labs have access to CDC test kits for coronavirus, they are conducting tests and reporting results directly to doctors, patients and the public. When these tests detect coronavirus, cases are considered “presumptive positive” until the CDC confirms results.</p>
<p>States can quickly act when a person has coronavirus, including ensuring an infected individual gets appropriate health care as well as tracing all of the person’s contacts. This allows public health officials to alert people who might have been exposed to coronavirus while also seeking to slow new infections.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration also has expanded access to private, commercially-manufactured tests so hospitals and doctors can more quickly access tests. Because these tests are authorized by the FDA, the CDC does not confirm positive results from these commercial tests. Still, the information can help doctors and public health officials take action as needed.</p>
<p>Commercials tests “will be a tool in the toolbox of clinicians in clinics and in hospitals that they can use based on clinical suspicion to test their patients,” said Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.</p>
<p>Why was the coronavirus test so hard to get initially?</p>
<p>The CDC initially chose to develop its own test based on genetic sequencing of the coronavirus initially reported by scientists in China, where the outbreak was first detected. The test measured tiny DNA samples to confirm whether a person is infected with novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. But soon after the tests were shipped in early February, states had trouble validating one of three components in the CDC’s test kits. States could not confirm the test results. The flaw delayed rapid testing among state and local labs, just as the deadly respiratory virus gained a foothold among infected travelers returning to the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC reviewed the glitch and concluded using two components could accurately detect coronavirus. The CDC began making kits with two components and sharing those kits with states and local public health laboratories.</p>
<p>The CDC had a rocky start. Why?</p>
<p>The test kit could have been in use earlier if the CDC had used one initially developed by the World Health Organization. Instead, the CDC raced to develop its own, and one that could do more than the WHO test, according to public health officials and news reports.</p>
<p>Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said both tests were &ldquo;being developed simultaneously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During any infectious disease response, scientists all over the world work simultaneously to develop tests,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The CDC and WHO protocols were first published about a week apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who is a former health secretary of Maryland and top Food and Drug Administration official said, “Figuring out what went wrong will require an investigation and help CDC make sure it does not happen again</p>
<p>Experts worry we now have limited insight into the spread of the virus. People who should be tested because they may have coronavirus weren’t. “The gaps in testing have slowed down control efforts,” said Sharfstein, now a public health professor and vice dean at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Experts say CDC wanted to make sure the results during surveillance and containment results were accurate, but some think the centers should have been focusing on mitigation and allowing the use of far more labs for clinical care.
