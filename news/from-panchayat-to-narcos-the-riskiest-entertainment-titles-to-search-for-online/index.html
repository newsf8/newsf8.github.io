<p>‘Free download’, ‘Free login’, ‘Free’, ‘Torrent’, ‘Pirated download’ — these are some of the top searches clubbed with modifying terms, such film or television titles, that have brought up malware attacks and cyber-vulnerabilities for users as they try to avoid subscription-based OTT platforms or paywall-based content.</p>
<p>Traffic across piracy websites has increased as the COVID-19 lockdowns ensue, seeing online video consumption also increasing. MUSO, a digital piracy authority, reported that piracy rose 62% in India in the last week of March compared with the last week of February. Trending piracy sites include names like Stremio, Popcorn Time, Solarmovie, 123Movies and Tamil Rockers.</p>
<p>That said, McAfee researched the risks Indian consumers could potentially be exposed to when browsing the web for popular online entertainment content.</p>
<p>“The lockdown induced surge in online entertainment traffic has brewed the perfect storm for cybercriminals. They are following and targeting consumers’ obsession with accessing content - particularly for free. They entice users to visit potentially malicious websites, designed to install malware or steal passwords and personal information,” said Venkat Krishnapur, McAfee India’s Vice President of Engineering and Managing Director in a company statement. “In these uncertain times, it is crucial that consumers stay vigilant, invest in responsible online behaviour and recognise that if something is too good to be true, it probably isn’t true.”</p>
<p>From an analysis of more than one hundred most talked about entertainment titles available across today’s leading streaming providers, McAfee identified a ‘top 10 web risk list’ for both television and movies — ranked in order of web search risk (from highest to lowest).</p>
<p>Protection tips straight from McAfee Be careful what you click: Users looking to catch up on season 2 of Ghoul, or a way to have Gully Boy on repeat should be cautious and only access entertainment content directly from a reliable source. The safest thing to do is to subscribe to a streaming site that offers the content or download the movie from sources like Netflix or Amazon, instead of downloading a ‘free’ version from a website that could potentially contain malware.</p>
<p>Refrain from using illegal streaming sites. Many illegal streaming sites are riddled with malware disguised as pirated video files. Do your device a favor and stream the show from a reputable source.</p>
<p>Protect your online realm with a cybersecurity solution. Send your regards to malicious actors with a comprehensive security solution. This can help protect you from malware, phishing attacks, and other threats.</p>
<p>Use parental control software. Kids are tech savvy and may search for movies by themselves. Ensure that limits are set on your child’s device and use software that can help minimise exposure to potentially malicious or inappropriate websites.</p>

<p>Most-targeted television segment: Regional Shows: According to McAfee, global players are recognising the need to build hyper local, India-centric offerings. Viewership of regional language content is growing, and the rise in consumption of vernacular TV shows in metros and semi-urban India is an apt reflection of this. Driving the demand for regional, UGC and short content is evident with shows such as Delhi Crime, Panchayat, Akoori and Ghoul leading the pack. Establishing the importance of basic cybersecurity hygiene is a key element in developing an informed netizen.</p>
<p>Most-targeted movie segment: Bollywood Films: When it comes to movies in India, it is no surprise that Bollywood is king. More than a third of the movies featuring in this list are box office hits like Mardaani 2, Chapaak, Love Aaj Kal, Baahubali and Gully Boy. This finding suggests that the popularity of Bollywood cinema may drive consumers to search for free access to trending and latest releases that they aren’t currently subscribed to.

<h3 id="vivian-dsena-opens-up-on-his-upcoming-shows-fans-call-me-king-of-romance-but-i-want-to-experiment-with-roles">&ldquo;Vivian Dsena OPENS UP on his upcoming shows: Fans call me king of romance but I want to experiment with roles&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vivian_dsena_opens_up_on_his_upcoming_shows_fans_call_me_king_of_romance_but_i_want_to_experiment_with_roles_social_0.jpg" alt="img">
Vivian Dsena, who was last seen as Harman Singh in Shakti: Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki, recently revealed about his upcoming projects, the kind of roles he wants to play onscreen, his future plans and more.</p>
<p>Vivian Dsena is one of the finest actors we have in the Indian Television industry, and there”s no doubt about the fact. He has shown his versatility, by portraying different shades in his shows. Whether it was playing an evil vampire in Pyaar Kii Ye Ek Kahaani or playing a romantic hero in Madhubala – Ek Ishq Ek Junoon, Vivian has proved that he can play positive as well as negative roles with utter perfection. And maybe it is the actor’s idea of not playing similar characters onscreen that has made him a ‘fan favourite.’</p>
<p>In a recent chat with the Times India, Vivian revealed that he does not want to stick to playing similar characters onscreen, but he rather wishes to explore and experiment as much as he can. He said that he wants his next character to be different from the last one that he played, and that is the whole idea. He revealed that once a senior person from the entertainment industry told him that his shows become a hit because he does not do the same thing, and brings freshness with each role. He said that in his career of 12 years until now, he played different characters and his formula is to give his fans variety.</p>

<p>The actor was last seen in ‘Shakti – Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki’ opposite Ribina Dilaik. Ask him about the competitiveness on the small screen and Vivian says that he is his own competition. He shared when people ask me if any other actor is his competition, he always says that he is competing with himself. He does not consider himself a perfectionist in any area or field. In fact, his fans call him the ‘king of romance’, but he does not want such things to get into his head. However, he also reveals that it has happened once in his life, and he does not want it to happen again. The handsome hunk says that he just wants to learn new things every day and grow as an actor, and every character that he plays teaches him something different.</p>
<p>When quipped about his upcoming project and when viewers will get to see his magic onscreen again, Vivian revealed that he has a lot of offers coming his way. However, he has not signed anything yet. Just like he mentioned he doesn’t want to play similar characters. He wishes to take up something that is different from what he has already done. He would sign anything only if the character appeals to him.</p>

Recently, fans of Korean television found a treat when the internet came up with a connection between two of its leading actors. Hyun Bin from Crash Landing on You, and The King: Eternal Monarch&rsquo;s Lee Min Ho have two things in common. Read more about this connection:</p>
<p>What does Lee Min Ho and Hyun Bin have in common?</p>
<p>According to a leading entertainment portal, Crash Landing on You’s Hyun Bin and The King: Eternal Monarch&rsquo;s Lee Min Ho have two things in common. The first being, both the actors have a television show released this year, and the other being the two stars reside in Seoul, making them neighbours. Fans of Min-ho are quite aware of his Mark Hills house in the Heukseok-dong neighbourhood of Seoul.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hyun Bin&rsquo;s residence was recently seen making the headlines, where fans realised that it is a 21-storeyed building that has one of the best views of Seoul. Each of the floors has just two apartments and it is “quite lavish”. This means that the chances of bumping into the two actors are now higher than ever for the fans.</p>

<h3 id="japans-akatsuki-looks-to-tie-up-with-netflix-amazon-for-indian-animation">&ldquo;Japan&rsquo;s Akatsuki looks to tie up with Netflix, Amazon for Indian animation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/06/21/600x338/Trai_1566272592027_1592717733136.jpg" alt="img">
New Delhi: Japanese entertainment company Akatsuki Inc that announced its foray into India late last year is looking to tie up with a host of video streaming players and cable television services to adapt its local content for Indian audiences.</p>
<p>Starting with video-on-demand services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar and YouTube, the company best known for mobile games such as Dragon Ball Z (that had notched up 250 million downloads since its release, according to a Forbes report) and Bringing Up My Girl, and franchises such as Japan Sinks 2020 and Kumarba, said it will initially dub Japanese originals into Indian languages which will be available by the end of this year.</p>
<p>“Apart from English and Hindi, we’re looking at dubbing them into other top Indian languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bengali. But in another two to three years, we want to looking at developing Indian originals with local writers and talent here,&quot; said Yuki Kawamura, head of global IP (intellectual property) expansion, in-charge of international business development and corporate development at Akatsuki Inc. Kawamura said the popularity of Japanese anime such as Doraemon and Shin-chan in India helped the company recognize the potential of the market.</p>
<p>“In contrast to Japan which has an ageing population, India has a huge kids segment which doesn’t have access to quality video content except perhaps live action,&quot; Kawamura added. India is the company’s only international focus, at the moment where it plans to invest “multiple millions of dollars every year.&quot;</p>
<p>Conversations with cable TV and VoD platforms had started earlier this year but things have paused because of the covid-19 pandemic. Akatsuki wants to eventually get to developing local Indian IPs but since that will take some time, it wants to bridge the timeline by dubbing five to six shows currently in the pipeline, details of which Kawamura declined to share.</p>
<p>Having long been seen as an entirely kids genre, animation is slowly catching up with Indian audiences. Disney’s animation film The Lion King, voiced by Shah Rukh Khan, crossed the ₹155 crore mark last year, emerging as the highest grossing Hollywood animation flick in India. Netflix is gung-ho about the success of Indian animation original Mighty Little Bheem that it says had the largest launch of any preschool original and the second-largest launch of any kids’ original animated series on the service. Several traditional forms of media may find their expansion derailed but the Indian animation and VFX segment is estimated to grow to Rs. 156 billion by 2022 according to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment industry report 2020.</p>
<p>Vivek Krishnani, managing director of SPE Films India Pvt. Ltd, the Indian division of Sony Pictures had said in an earlier interview to Mint that studios and filmmakers now realize the value of entire families going to theatres to watch animation. Localization initiatives such as getting a popular voice cast are taken to ensure Indian audiences connect with animated content in the language of their choice, apart from getting a fun, colloquial twang to the script and dialogues. There is much focus on writing afresh for local Indian versions of animation films, like all Hollywood films now, and not merely translating them from English.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen the trend set by companies like Disney in India and we hope to enhance that,&quot; Kawamura said. “The demand for animation has always been there but I don’t think there was full supply and we want to bridge that gap.&quot;</p>

Rowan Atkinson was &lsquo;&lsquo;so proud&rsquo;&rsquo; to be part of &lsquo;&lsquo;The Lion King&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rowan Atkinson was &lsquo;&lsquo;so proud&rsquo;&rsquo; to be part of &lsquo;&lsquo;The Lion King&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Los Angeles, June 22 (IANS) Veteran English actor Rowan Atkinson, who had lent his voice to Zazu in &ldquo;The Lion King&rdquo;, says he was proud to have been a part of the 1994 animated movie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so proud really in the end to be part of this movie because I didn'&rsquo;t want to do it actually because voiceovers are generally&hellip;voice work is something that I'&rsquo;ve never done and I never liked it because I feel as though I am a visual artiste if I am in anything&hellip; and it seemed to be a pointless thing to do the film,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the co-writer of &lsquo;&lsquo;Mr. Bean&rsquo;&rsquo; series Robin Driscoll said &lsquo;&lsquo;I'&rsquo;ve been offered this movie called &lsquo;&lsquo;The Lion King&rsquo;&rsquo; and I really can'&rsquo;t be bothered to do it&rsquo;&rsquo;. He said &lsquo;&lsquo;Well come on! It'&rsquo;s Disney, you might as well!&rsquo;&rsquo; and then I didn'&rsquo;t realise it would turn into the really very special film, which it did,&rdquo; added Atkinson.</p>
<p>On June 24, 2020, &ldquo;The Lion King&rdquo; will be celebrating its 26th anniversary. The film has established a legacy that comprises a direct-to-video sequel, a spin-off movie, a 2019 film remake, a television film sequel, two spin-off television series, three educational shorts, several video games and merchandise.</p>
<p>It will be aired on Star Movies on June 24 as a part of its &lsquo;&lsquo;This Day That Year&rsquo;&rsquo; film pack.</p>
