They have been isolating together in their plush pad.</p>
<p>And Perrie Edwards has shared an insight to what it&rsquo;s like being housebound with her boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain during Friday&rsquo;s episode of Good Morning Britain.</p>
<p>The Little Mix star, 26, playfully said that living with her beau at the moment is like being with a child after they have been given &lsquo;Coca-Cola and sweets&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Isolation: Perrie Edwards has shared an insight to what it&rsquo;s like being housebound with her boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain during Friday&rsquo;s episode of Good Morning Britain</p>
<p>Perrie appeared on video link from their home as she spoke to hosts Ben Shepherd and Lorraine Kelly amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Her beau Alex typically spends his day training at Liverpool Football Club, however premiere league sides are currently suspended and not expected to play until June.</p>
<p>Perrie joked that Alex has lots of extra energy and said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like giving a child have Coca Cola and a whole bag of sweets and putting them in a room and keeping them in there. He&rsquo;s got so much energy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>However generally she admitted things have been running smoothly, adding: &lsquo;Actually really well, not too bad. We&rsquo;re just trying to stay positive and keep ourselves busy and I&rsquo;ve just been doing loads of stuff like knitting, a bit of baking, random stuff I never normally have time for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Energetic: The Little Mix star, 26, playfully said that living with her beau at the moment is like being with a child after they have been given &lsquo;Coca-Cola and sweets&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perrie and Alex kept their followers entertained earlier this week by sharing a Tik Tok video of the two of them dancing on their kitchen stairs.</p>
<p>Discussing how she learned the steps to the viral video, Perrie said: &lsquo;It took me a good while. Alex learned straight away because he&rsquo;s annoyingly good at everything, so he got it straight away and I just kept getting it wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s really good at stuff like that, but I kept getting scared on the stairs, like if I fell and broke an ankle. But it was really fun when we got it, it was brilliant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Photo bomb! Perrie&rsquo;s pooch Hatchi (pictured) also appeared briefly on the video and she revealed he is being &lsquo;needy&rsquo; because he&rsquo;s jealous of their new Bulldog puppy Travis.</p>

<p>The star also revealed that the group are going to go ahead and release their new single Break Up Song in a bid to &lsquo;life everyone&rsquo;s spirits&rsquo; in the current climate.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s such a weird time for everybody. Luckily for us we had the single sorted, we had everything ready to go. We were going to hold off releasing it, but it&rsquo;s a nice positive, uplifting song, it&rsquo;ll make everyone feel good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suspended: Her beau Alex typically spends his day training at Liverpool Football Club, however premiere league sides are currently suspended and not expected to play until June</p>
<p>Girl gang! Although she&rsquo;s been spending more time with her boyfriend, Perrie has been isolated from her band mates for the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Although she&rsquo;s been spending more time with her boyfriend, Perrie has been isolated from her band mates for the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>However she assured fans they are constantly in touch, and said: &lsquo;Our group chat on WhatsApp is always popping off. We&rsquo;re so used to being together 24/7, we live in each other&rsquo;s pockets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we&rsquo;re not together, it feels really weird. But it&rsquo;s also quite nice to have a little bit of breathing space for once because we never get time off. It&rsquo;s just weird circumstances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earlier during a radio appearance on Heart Breakfast with Amanda Holden and Jamie Theakston, Perrie revealed while the single will be released their album is on hold.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;I feel like it’s [the single] such a good upbeat positive uplifting song and that’s just what people need right now, but with the album, I think we are going to have to postpone it yeah.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Amanda suggested that the band could release it later in the summer or in the autumn, before Perrie agreed and said &lsquo;yeah.&rsquo;

<h3 id="perrie-edwards-chats-with-katharine-mcphee-and-david-foster-from-lockdown">Perrie Edwards chats with Katharine McPhee and David Foster from lockdown</h3>

Because there’s nothing we love more than an unexpected celebrity friendship (Picture: Katherine Foster/Instagram)</p>
<p>Perrie Edwards formed an unlikely lockdown friendship with Katharine McPhee and David Foster as the trio video chatted for Katharine’s birthday.</p>
<p>Turning 36 in isolation on Wednesday, the stage and TV actress roped in her 70-year-old husband for a birthday celebration which she shared with fans on Instagram Live.</p>
<p>And one of the unlikely famous faces to join the couple was Perrie, 26, who serenaded Katharine with a version of The Simpsons’ infamous Happy Birthday Lisa song (with Katharine’s name in it, of course…)</p>
<p>Explaining that they’d never actually met IRL but were just fans of each other from Instagram, the birthday girl had a fangirl moment as she told Perrie: ‘We listened to Little Mix today in the car. We went out for five minutes today and we listened to Little Mix.’</p>

<p>Katharine then decided to shoot her shot, asking Perrie: ‘Can I just say, if there’s ever a slot open in your girl group, I know I’m not British, but I would love to join.’</p>
<p>‘It might be a strain on our marriage because of the travelling,’ she continued as she indicated to David, with the composer shooting back: ‘Not to mention it’s your birthday, you’re kind of old now for that.’</p>

<p>Luckily, Perrie was on board, joking: ‘I love it, you can definitely be the fifth member.’</p>
<p>You better check with the others first, Pez.</p>
<p>The call is one in a long line of activities the Little Mix singer has shown herself doing in self-isolation, including learning TikTok dances with boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
<p>But while the coronavirus crisis might cause her band’s new album to be delayed, Perrie admitted that she’s enjoying having a little break after a hectic few months and years with the band.</p>
<p>‘We’re so used to being together 24/7, we live in each other’s pockets. When we’re not together, it feels really weird,’ she said.</p>
<p>‘But it’s also quite nice to have a little bit of breathing space for once, because we never get time off. It’s just weird circumstances.’</p>

<h3 id="little-mixs-perrie-edwards-on-life-in-lockdown-with-boyfriend-alex-oxlade-chamberlain">Little Mix&rsquo;s Perrie Edwards on life in lockdown with boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</h3>

<p>Perrie Edwards has opened up about what she has been up to while self-isolating.</p>
<p>The Little Mix singer and her boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have opted to isolate in London amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The Liverpool Echo reports the pair decided to stay in the capital after the Premier League season was suspended until at least April 30.</p>
<p>Speaking to Kiss radio, Perrie said: &ldquo;I have a house – well, my boyfriend and I have a house in Manchester and a house in London, so we were originally in Manchester together and then we decided to come to London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kind of wish we’d stayed in Manchester rather than London ‘cos there’s more to do there, like in his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have got a lovely house in London with a little garden so Hatchi’s alright. It’s just weird, isn’t it? Not being able to leave the house, because I have been isolating for ages now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked what she has been up to while of precautionary self-isolation, Perrie told: &ldquo;I haven’t been doing any exercise! I’ve been watching loads of Netflix, I started Money Heist which is unreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’ve been singing a little bit, I’ve been cooking a lot because my boyfriend is never full, like try isolating with an athlete!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to ration your food and every five seconds &lsquo;I’m hungry! I’m hungry again. Can I have some food now?&rsquo; I’m like, seriously?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’ve been baking, which I never do. I baked a banana bread cake the other day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s the best cake nobody will ever be able to taste. We were FaceTiming all our family like &lsquo;if only you could taste this right now&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A video shared to popular app TikTok earlier this month, which showed the couple dancing in unison, quickly went viral.</p>
<p>In response to the clip, Perrie added: &ldquo;And TikToking – I absolutely love TikTok, I can’t believe I haven’t had it until now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The popstar was also asked whether the pair had had any rows during isolation. The 26-year-old said: &ldquo;I’m probably this close to burning, or just cutting straight through the wire of the PlayStation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There’s going to be a situation here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, even just sat in the lounge trying to Netflix and chill there’s just &lsquo;It’s behind you mate behind you urghhh&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m like &lsquo;Stop with the PlayStation for two seconds!'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Mix are set to release their new single entitled Break Up Song this Friday.
