<p>Three people including a 56-year-old chief have been killed in Dowa after being suspected of practicing witchcraft.</p>
<p>Two bodies of men have been found while the body of a woman who was also killed is still missing. The victims are Village Headman Kachiwaya (Master Gogo Kachiwaya), Jenala Chidzele and Sintuma Siliya</p>
<p>According to Dowa Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Sub Inspector Gladson M’bumpha, the three were murdered on Sunday, May 31, 2020 in the two villages of Kachiwaya and Kanyumbo in the area of Traditional Authority Chiwere in Dowa District.</p>
<p>On May 28, villagers from Kachiwaya Village accused Village Headman Kachiwaya (Master Gogo Kachiwaya) of bewitching his nephew who on May 18 2020 was involved in a fatal road accident.</p>
<p>All the village headman’s property was burnt to ashes but Kachiwaya escaped.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the villagers mobilised themselves and picked him from Lilongwe where he went to seek refugee on pretence that they were taking him to police.</p>
<p>When the mob brought Village Headman Kachiwaya to the village, they burnt him and left him on the ground until police in conjunction with Malawi Defence Force soldiers went to the village and recovered the body.</p>
<p>Police managed to arrest four suspects and the dead body of the village headman is currently at Dowa District Hospital awaiting postmortem.</p>
<p>On the same day, villagers from Kanyumbo Village and nearby villages upon hearing the news that villagers from Kachiwaya Village had burnt to death Master Gogo Kachiwaya after accusing him of practising witchcraft, they too also hunted for Jenala Chidzele and Sintuma Siliya whom they had been suspecting to be witches.</p>
<p>The villagers got hold of Chidzele and beat him to death. They then burned his body. Later, they chased Sintuma Siliya and beat her at a garden. Her body is missing, according to the police.</p>
<p>Police in conjunction with MDF soldiers of Mvera Support Battalion recovered the dead body of Jenala Chidzele and arrested six suspects.</p>
<p>Master Gogo Kachiwaya came from Kachiwaya Village, Jenala Chidzele from Kanyumbo Village and Sintuma Siliya, from Kanyumbo Village all from Traditional Authority Chiwere in Dowa District.

President Peter Mutharika says opposition parties have adopted political violence as a permanent strategy for achieving political goals.</p>
<p>The Malawi leader said this following Monday’s attack on Presidential Advisor on Political Affairs Dean Josiah Banda.</p>
<p>Banda was stoned and wounded at Gawamadzi village in the area of Traditional Authority Chiwere in Dowa district.</p>
<p>According to state broadcaster MBC, he was holding a rally in the area ahead of the country’s forthcoming Fresh Presidential Election.</p>
<p>Speaking through his spokesperson Mgeme Kalirani, Mutharika condemned acts of violence happening in the country.</p>
<p>He warned that government will not allow barbarism to take root in the country.</p>
<p>“President Mutharika has continued to warn all political leaders embracing political violence as a political tool to stop immediately or face the consequences,” said Kalirani.</p>
<p>Political parties are currently holding campaign rallies ahead of the fresh presidential elections.</p>
<p>Since campaign started, the country has witnessed acts of political violence in Mzuzu, Salima, Kasungu, Ndirande, Phalombe, Mponela, Mulanje and Machinga.</p>
<p>In Ndirande, Mutharika’s convoy was stoned while the convoy of Vice President Saulos Chilima who is runningmate for the opposition Tonse Alliance was also attacked in Phalombe.</p>
<p>Chilima was also blocked from holding a campaign rally in Machinga last week.</p>
<p>Mutharika’s runningmate Atupele Muluzi was a victim of political violence in Mponela last month when he was stopped from conducting a rally.

<h3 id="qa-saul-schwartz-15-on-preserving-chiwere">&ldquo;Q&amp;A: Saul Schwartz *15, on Preserving Chiwere&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://paw.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/images/content/Treuer-SchwartzHeadnew.jpg" alt="img">
The last fluent speakers of Chiwere, the language of the Iowa and Otoe-Missouria Indians, died in the 1990s. For his Princeton dissertation, anthropologist Saul Schwartz *15, a research assistant professor at the University of Miami, studied efforts to document, preserve, and perhaps revitalize the language, which is in the Sioux family. His interest took root when, as an undergraduate, he was introduced to Jimm Goodtracks, who was writing a Chiwere dictionary. During graduate school, he lived with Goodtracks for two summers and then spent 14 months living in White Cloud, Kan., the seat of government for one of the Iowa tribes.</p>
<p>How well do you speak Chiwere?</p>
<p>I tried to learn it as best I could. Jimm and I spoke to his grandson only in Chiwere when I lived with them. But I am very far from fluent.</p>
<p>How does Chiwere differ from other Native American languages?</p>
<p>Chiwere is relatively understudied and documented compared to other Siouan languages like Lakota or Dakota, which have a much larger speaker base. It has a lot of similarities to Ho-Chunk, which is also known as Winnebago. But we’re still trying to figure out how exactly Chiwere grammar works and how similar or different it is from other Siouan languages. There is still a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Do you think it will be possible to teach people to speak Chiwere fluently again?</p>
<p>I think it is possible if that is something tribal members themselves want. Other communities have had success bringing back their language working from historical documentation. Myaamia and Wampanoag are two examples of that. As a non-Native anthropologist, though, I’m mostly interested in understanding Chiwere and why people would want to revitalize it — and assisting those efforts, if I’m invited to participate. But it’s not necessary for tribal members to speak their heritage language in order to maintain distinctive cultures and identities.</p>
<p>What is the reason for revitalizing Chiwere?</p>
<p>Ioways and Otoe-Missourians tell me that one of the most important reasons is to connect with their ancestors. The last fluent speakers only died 20 years ago. The parents and grandparents of the current generation still used Chiwere in their everyday lives. Current members of the tribe say that revitalizing it helps them understand the culture of the previous generations and how their ancestors viewed the world.</p>

<p>Man demands girlfriend to strip and walk na_ked after cheating on him</p>
<p>An Odzi man was sentenced to five months behind the bars for stripping his girlfriend na_ked and forcing her to do the walk of shame as punishment for cheating on him.</p>
<p>Charles Mbaara (43) was convicted at Mutare Magistrate’s court on his own plea of guilty to two counts of physical abuse as outlined in Section 89 (1) (a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act.</p>
<p>On the first count, Mbaara was ordered to pay a fine of $100 or serve 20 years behind bars.</p>
<p>On the second count he was sentenced to five months, but will serve an effective three months after the magistrate suspended two months on condition he does not commit a similar offence in the next five years.</p>
<p>It is the states case that on December 27, 2019, at Chiwere Business Centre, in Odzi, Mbaara went to see his girlfriend, Laiza Karenje, at her workplace, around 9pm and found her in the company of another man. He then asked her to accompany him for a walk, but she refused. Mbaara then stalked her to a nearby shop where he confronted and physically attacked her. He manhandled her and dragged her to a nearby bush, threatening to beat her up again. Upon arrival he ordered her to remove all her clothes and instructed her to walk back to the business centre in her birthday suit. Karenje eventually escaped and sought refuge at a nearby house where she was given clothes by an unidentified certain woman.</p>
<p>Asked on why he publicly humiliated and demeaned her, Mbaara said he was doing it out of revenge</p>
<p>“Laiza is my girlfriend and we just had a minor misunderstanding. I just wanted her to feel how it feels to be hurt,” he said.</p>

“We do not know when it stopped working, but what we know is that the current owners acquired it in 1996.

<h3 id="rival-villagers-fight-in-dowa-grab-land-and-livestock-others-fleeing-to-mzimba">&ldquo;Rival villagers fight in Dowa, grab land and livestock: Others fleeing to Mzimba&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nyasatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/a-Nyasa-Times-pic-3249.jpg" alt="img">
Malawi Police in Dowa are investigating clashes between two tribes which has led to 12 members of a Chewa tribe fleeing to Mzimba after ngoni villagers descended the village, grabbing land and livestock.</p>
<p>At least nine ngoni villagers descended on Chokoma village, the only Chewa village in chief Chiwere’s area in the district, grabbing land and livestock and destroying property.</p>
<p>Police spokesperson in Dowa Richard Kaponda confirmed the incident, saying the police were waiting for the villagers to lodge a complaint before arrests were made although investigations on the matter had started.</p>
<p>“We are aware of the issue but no chief has reported the matter to us. We will take action once the issue has been reported to us,” he said.</p>
<p>Dowa has a unique set up as most of the traditional leaders are Ngoni although they are in central region and this has caused friction between the Chewas and the Ngonis.</p>
<p>Some of the Ngoni traditional leaders said they invaded the Chewa village to force village headman Chakoma make peace with them.</p>
<p>“He is a very difficult village headman, we just want him to agree to our peace terms,” said one of the village headmen.</p>
<p>Village headman Chakoma and chief Chiwere were not immediately available for comment whilst officials from the district commissioner could not be reached as they were reportedly on Christmas and New Year holidays.</p>
