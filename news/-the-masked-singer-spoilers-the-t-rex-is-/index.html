By the end of the “The Masked “Singer” episode on March 25, half of the 18 contestants will have been sent home with three apiece coming from Groups A, B and C. The remaining four contenders from Group C — Astronaut, Night Angel, Rhino and T-Rex — competed in this ninth episode, which aired Wednesday. One of them will be eliminated at the end of the show while the other three will continue on in the competition in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Of this quartet, the biggest surprise has been the one hidden inside the T-Rex costume. She first appeared on March 11, and wowed the crowd with her energetic cover of “So What” by P!nk. Last week, she made the most of “Push It” by Salt-n-Pepa.</p>
<p>Keep reading as we’ve got “The Masked Singer” spoilers for all four of these contestants, including our best guess as to the real identity of the T-Rex.</p>
<p>SEE ‘The Masked Singer’ spoilers: The Astronaut is …</p>
<p>We are certain that the T-Rex is reality TV star JoJo Siwa.</p>
<p>In her first clues video, we saw the T-Rex talking to a doll. That told us she is on the younger side; Siwa is only 16. She was just nine when she appeared on season 2 of “Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition” in 2013. She then stole scenes on on another Abby Miller reality show, “Dance Moms.”</p>
<p>Three years ago, JoJo made the New York Times bestsellers list with her memoir “JoJo’s Guide to the Sweet Life: #PeaceOutHaterz.” Between them, the 18 contestants on “The Masked Singer” have written three books that achieved this benchmark.</p>
<p>SEE ‘The Masked Singer’ spoilers: The Night Angel is …</p>
<p>Siwa loves to sing and has hits with “Boomerang” and “Kid in a Candy Store.” The video for “Boomerang” racked up an astonishing 450 million views. Currently, she runs two hit YouTube channels: “JoJo Siwa TV” and “It’s JoJo Siwa.”</p>
<p>SEE ‘The Masked Singer’ spoilers: The Rhino is …</p>
<p>We won’t find out whether we are right that the T-Rex is Jojo Siwa until she is unmasked. That will happen when one of two things occur: she loses a vote or wins the show. Do you think we are right about the true identity of the T-Rex? Sound off in the comments section with your best guesses.

RELATED STORIES The Masked Singer Recap: A Star Is Horn</p>
<p>The Masked Singer Recap: A Star Is Horn FBI and The Resident Set Early Season Finales &ndash; With Their Next Episodes</p>
<p>We’d understand if you had a hard time recognizing The Masked Singer‘s T-Rex before her unmasking in Wednesday’s episode: The person inside her was so bouncy, so energetic, so constantly in motion that it was hard to pin her down — in any sense.</p>
<p>“The T-Rex, I wanted to make sure that her energy was crazy,” says the dino, aka YouTube star JoJo Siwa, when TVLine chats with her Wednesday.” When I got there, they said, ‘What’s your thing going to be?” I said, “I want to be unstoppable. I want to have the most energy ever.” (Read a recap of this week’s episode here.)</p>
<p>Mission accomplished. Read on for the Dance Moms alum/bow enthusiast/highly successful YouTuber’s thoughts on her prehistoric musical turn.</p>
<p>TVLINE | When you were singing Salt-n- Pepa’s “Push It” last week, I noticed you nailed the words.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>TVLINE | You’re 16, correct?</p>
<p>I’m 16, yes.</p>
<p>TVLINE | I know the words because I was alive when it was on the radio. But you’re so young — did you know that song, or did you have to study up on it?</p>
<p>I did have to study up on it! Because everybody knows, “Ah, push it! Push it real good!” Then I knew the beginning of it, “Salt-n-Pepa’s here,” but I didn’t know what the real lyrics were? I was like, “Salt-n-Pepa’s here and we’re gettin’ back, it’s time to push it back” and then I learned that oh my God no, the lyrics are, “Salt-n-Pepa’s here and we’re in effect, want you to push it back.” [Continues to rap the song] All the different “Yo yo yo yo”s, how many there were. It took a lot of practice. [Laughs]</p>
<p>TVLINE | You got your start on Dance Moms. What was harder: Performing in that cumbersome T-Rex costume or getting dressed down by Abby Lee Miller when you did something wrong?</p>
<p>Oh, that’s a good one. I’m not going to say. You know Kendall [Vertes] from Dance Moms, she actually put it [well]. Someone asked her, if she could go back to Dance Moms, would she? Or did she regret it? She said “I don’t regret doing it. I wouldn’t do it again, but I just wish I could have one more day.” And that’s so true with Dance Moms, because we all — I mean, I didn’t, but I did at the same time — I remember having fun and loving it, but we really took it for granted. That’s something that I just learned. Now, with what’s going on in the world, obviously the coronavirus, we take a lot of things for granted. And that’s what happened on Dance Moms. Even though it was so hard, it was always so fun.</p>
<p>The same thing for Masked Singer. I took it for granted for a second in the beginning but then I was like, “Wait, JoJo. You need to enjoy every second of this, even though it’s hard. Even though you can’t breathe. It’s worth a minute-and-a-half of your life you can’t breathe for three weeks of amazing people. I was like, “Knock it off. You are having the time of your life right now. Just enjoy it.”</p>
<p>TVLINE | I’m kind of surprised you didn’t work any bows into your costume.</p>
<p>We were going to do something, because all of the JoJo bows have a tag on them, a little silver tag. We couldn’t put a bow on, because that would just be too obvious. I said to the costume designer, “We should put a little silver charm on it to represent the tag.” And then I think it just fell through.</p>
<p>TVLINE | You didn’t sing any Miley Cyrus songs.</p>
<p>My next song that I requested to do was either “Another One Bites the Dust” [by Queen] or “Can’t Be Tamed” [by Cyrus]. I thought T-Rex and “Can’t Be Tamed” would be so fun and so good. No, I didn’t do any Miley songs. But it’s OK. Miley knows I love her.
