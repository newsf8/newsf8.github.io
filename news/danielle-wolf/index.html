<p>Danielle Lupo doesn’t mind wearing her bunny ears or a white coat.</p>
<p>The Playboy model and Bunny is a Certified Cardiographic Technician (CCT) with big dreams of becoming a doctor.</p>
<p>Lupo, who has been working in the healthcare field for almost 10 years now, is aware many people don’t take her two roles seriously, but is still determined to show off her talents and, as she said, “use her platform for good.” And she’s even sharing her advice on how to cope with the current coronavirus pandemic along the way.</p>
<p>Lupo spoke to Fox News about her career in health care, posing for Playboy, how her parents really feel about her “two worlds,” and the funniest encounter she’s ever had with a patron at the Playboy Club.</p>
<p>PLAYBOY PLAYMATE CANDACE COLLINS JORDAN TALKS POSING FOR THE MAG AT 65: ‘I DID WORRY ABOUT GOING BACK&rsquo;</p>
<p>PLAYBOY PLAYMATE SAVANNAH SMITH SAYS STRIPPING DOWN FOR THE MAG WAS ‘A REALLY COMFORTING EXPERIENCE’</p>
<p>Fox News: What drew you to health care?</p>
<p>Danielle Lupo: I got into a bad car accident and that inspired me to pursue health care, being in the hospital and meeting all kinds of different doctors and nurses who wanted to help others. I was originally a dental assistant, but I ultimately switched gears. I work in cardiology now but I’m in the process of applying to med schools to pursue a doctorate program. I’ve been offering my expertise now virtually.</p>
<p>Fox News: You are a cardiographic technician. What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>Lupo: I measure the electricity of the heart and analyze the functions of the heart. It allows us to assist physicians to diagnose and treat cardiac diseases and find out what causes certain heart problems. It’s amazing what our bodies are capable of and we want to ensure patients are on a healthy path.</p>
<p>Fox News: As someone in the medical world, what advice would you give concerning the coronavirus pandemic?</p>
<p>Lupo: Sanitization is so important right now. Washing your hands is so important. Try not to touch your face. I believe the average person touches their face like 300 times a day or something crazy like that without evening knowing it. Wearing a mask makes a big difference and reduces the spread of the virus. I think it’s so important to make these habits part of our daily lives. The minute I leave any store, I wash my hands and sanitize with a sanitizer that has more than 60 percent of alcohol in it.</p>
<p>AMPUTEE MODEL MARSHA ELLE RECALLS SEEING HER PHOTOS IN PLAYBOY: ‘IT SHOOK ME TO MY CORE’</p>
<p>PLAYBOY PLAYMATE RILEY TICOTIN SAYS SHE WAS ORIGINALLY DROPPED BY AGENCY BECAUSE ‘I NEVER GOT SKINNY ENOUGH&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fox News: How were you discovered by Playboy?</p>
<p>Lupo: This was more than a few years ago now, but I shot with a photographer for international Playboy I believe in 2017. I ended up getting a bunch of features from Playboy around the globe… Honestly, it was such a fun experience. I made so many friends through the connections Playboy provided. I wouldn’t change those times for anything.</p>
<p>Fox News: What was the photo shoot like?</p>
<p>Lupo: I definitely had those stars in my eyes for Playboy. It was always a dream of mine. And I was comfortable in my body, comfortable in my own skin. I know a lot of people say they get nervous posing for Playboy, but it really wasn’t a nerve-wracking experience for me. I had such a wonderful photographer who was so professional. We shot at a mountain lodge in Vermont and they were the most beautiful photos I’ve ever seen of myself. That was definitely a confidence booster. I was just really excited about the experience.</p>
<p>Fox News: What was going through your mind when you saw those photos for the first time?</p>
<p>Lupo: It’s amazing what glam lighting can do (laughs). But I saw myself in a different way. I was really proud of myself. I felt so comfortable in my skin and I think that came through in the photos. I was very happy with the results and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
<p>PLAYBOY PLAYMATE RENEE TENISON RECALLS SHOCKING HER TOWN AFTER STRIPPING DOWN: ‘I WAS GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY’</p>
<p>PLAYBOY MODEL JOY CORRIGAN RECALLS FATHER’S ‘FUNNY’ REACTION TO HER FIRST APPEARANCE: ‘MY DAD WASN’T HAPPY’</p>
<p>Fox News: You also worked as a Playboy Bunny at the Playboy Club. What’s the funniest or most unique encounter you’ve ever had with a patron?</p>
<p>Lupo: I remember this one guy who just expected me to be bubbly and that’s pretty much it. But when I started talking to him, you could just see his eyes widening up. I told him I was premed and he was like, “Whoa, wait, you’re smart too!” I was like, “Oh, well thanks.” I guess it was kind of a compliment (laughs). But people always underestimate me and never expect that I’m in the medical world. Like how can a Playboy Bunny in health care be taken seriously? I think it’s refreshing.</p>
<p>Fox News: Have you ever been perceived in a different way at work because of your ties to Playboy?</p>
<p>Lupo: I’ve never been directly approached with that. I’m sure people do their homework. But I keep things super professional. I don’t wear makeup at work. I wear my glasses. I definitely have that Clark Kent thing going on. But I let my work speak for itself. I work twice as hard to beat the stigma and stereotype.</p>
<p>PLAYBOY PLAYMATE CHASITY SAMONE SAYS SHE WANTS TO PURSUE POLITICS: ‘WE HAVE BIGGER ISSUES TO TACKLE’</p>
<p>PLAYBOY PLAYMATE BRANDE RODERICK RECALLS HER ‘BAYWATCH’ DAYS WITH JASON MOMOA: ‘SHOW ME YOUR &lsquo;AQUAMAN&rsquo; MOVES’</p>
<p>Fox News: You’re studying to be a doctor. Have you ever thought about the possibility of a patient learning about your ties to Playboy?</p>
<p>Lupo: That’s why I left my last name out of the full pictorial in the Czech issue. I don’t ever want someone to be like, “Hey, here’s my doctor who also happens to be in Playboy.” It’s unfortunate because people don’t understand Playboy to the fullest - that you can be a beautiful, intelligent woman who’s proud of her body. It doesn’t make you any less intelligent just because you’re comfortable in your own skin and proud of it. It’s empowering. But unfortunately, some people do think that way. But I’ve worked way too hard to let that stop me.</p>
<p>PLAYBOY MODEL JORDAN EMANUEL NAMED 2019 PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR</p>
<p>DOLLY PARTON SAYS SHE WANTS TO BE ON PLAYBOY COVER AGAIN FOR 75TH BIRTHDAY: ‘IT WOULD BE SUCH A HOOT&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fox News: Some critics may say Playboy could be a distraction when it comes to your medical work. What would you tell those people?</p>
<p>Lupo: I would tell them to mind their business &ndash; in a nice way, of course (laughs). I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having hobbies, even if it’s modeling. I know there are people who are not comfortable with Playboy and all that it entails, but they’re totally free to think that way and to have their own opinions. But I do try to keep things very tasteful. There shouldn’t really be any serious concerns other than making sure you keep your worlds separate and still respect both aspects. My modeling career and healthcare career can both live at the same time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;SELLING SUNSET&rsquo; STAR HEATHER RAE YOUNG RECOUNTS HOW PLAYBOY PATH PAVED WAY FOR LUCRATIVE REAL ESTATE CAREER</p>
<p>PLAYBOY’S MAY 2019 PLAYMATE ABIGAIL O’NEIL SAYS SHE SLEPT IN HER CAR BEFORE FINDING FAME WITH MAG</p>
<p>You only need to look at the magazine or meet another Bunny to see how Playboy celebrates women. You meet women from all different walks of life and different backgrounds. We all have different beliefs, different dreams &ndash; and Playboy accepts them all. They encourage us to pursue those dreams. And it’s a sisterhood. I’ve developed friendships that I still treasure to this day. I&rsquo;m proud to be associated with a brand that celebrates women.</p>
<p>Fox News: How does your family feel about you being in Playboy?</p>
<p>Lupo: My mom is super conservative and reserved about it. She won’t tell her friends that I worked for Playboy or the club because, frankly, they wouldn’t get it. My dad is more well-versed in knowing what an honor it is to be a Bunny and to have that title. He thinks it’s cool to tell people that his daughter is a Bunny… My parents just want me to keep things classy and tasteful, which I do. And they’re excited to call me doctor one day (laughs).</p>
<p>MAREN MORRIS TEASES PLAYBOY PHOTO SHOOT</p>
<p>PLAYBOY FOUNDER HUGH HEFNER’S FBI FILE RELEASED: HERE’S WHAT THE DOCUMENTS REVEAL</p>
<p>Fox News: What does the future hold for you?</p>
<p>Lupo: I want to continue balancing both worlds. I want to keep on the same track and achieve my dreams. I want to learn new things, meet new people and, of course, help others in need. I know there’s a lot I can do and I’m determined to show that. I want to use my platform for good. I specialize now in cardiology, but there are a lot of different roads I can take in the medical world and I’m excited about that. I’m passionate about the things that I can achieve.

LIKE it or not there is certainly a stereotype that comes with being a Playboy bunny - and it usually has nothing to do with your brains.</p>
<p>But one Playmate determined to smash the ‘bimbo’ association is Danielle Lupo, 24, who has just graduated from pre-medical school and is now looking to progress to a doctor.</p>
<p>8 Danielle Lupo divides her time between the Playboy club and medical school Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>8 Dani has been in healthcare field for ten years Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>Dani, who lives in New Jersey, began life as a dental assistant and has been in the healthcare field for 10 years after a bad accident exposed her to the industry.</p>
<p>Speaking to Fabulous Digital she said: “I got in a bad accident and I had to go to the hospital and that’s when I got exposed to all the kinds of things you can do in medical.</p>
<p>“After just graduating last year I’m looking at medical schools and doctoral programmes all while working as a cardiographic technician.”</p>
<p>But while Dani is hard at work studying during the day, at night she strips off her stethoscope and dons her bunny tail to work at New York’s Playboy club, which is currently closed due to lockdown.</p>
<p>8 Danielle admits that her mum struggled with the idea of her modelling Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>8 She has previously changed her name on naked shoots so that her patients won&rsquo;t be able to Google her naked Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>She explained: “It’s great money on the side and I had a lot of fun doing a bunch of different shoots and I got into multiple international Playboy issues.</p>
<p>“I had the best time and it was just an honour to be published and then the Playboy club New York just opened and I tried out and got the position as a Playboy bunny.</p>
<p>8 Danielle describes herself as a &lsquo;feminist&rsquo; and says Playboy &lsquo;celebrates women&rsquo; Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>“That was really cool, I was dressing up at night and going to school and working at the hospital (during the day).</p>
<p>“I looked at it as two part time jobs that would fill my schedule, I guess you could say they contradicted each other.</p>
<p>“The medical field is super conservative and Playboy is obviously free and liberating.”</p>
<p>I used a different name, because I’m going to be a doctor one day and I don’t want people Googling me Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>And rather than hindering her medical studies, Dani insists that doing both has given her “the best of both worlds.”</p>
<p>“While the club was open, it would consist of me making sure I had my homework in on time, before commuting an hour from Jersey to New York.</p>
<p>“It was an experience I wouldn’t trade for anything, I’m glad that I could find balance in both aspects of my life because I wouldn’t want to give up either one honestly.”</p>

<p>Dani is helping out with the current Covid-19 battle where she can but not everyone is a big fan of her side-line of work as she admits that family and friends had their concerns when it came to her after-hours work.</p>
<p>Dani said: “My mom was not a big fan, interestingly enough my dad was super supportive, he went to college and he understands that aspect.</p>
<p>“My mom is focused on telling people her daughter works at the hospital and leaving out the modelling part and some conservative friends have their concerns about Playboy.”</p>
<p>However, Dani is mindful of the fact that her previous career choices may impact her future as a doctor and has taken precautions.</p>
<p>“For my full nude pictorial in Czech Republic I used a different name, because I’m going to be a doctor one day and I don’t want people Googling me and seeing that.”</p>
<p>8 The model regrets nothing about her double life Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>Being drop -dead gorgeous you won’t be surprised to hear that Danielle is not single, currently dating tattoo artist Jon Boy.</p>
<p>Despite having met her boyfriend at the Playboy club, it seems that he too sometimes struggles with her line of work.</p>
<p>“Couples have their moments and their disagreements but he supports me” she explains.</p>
<p>“He has to understand that there’s going to be certain attention on me and not to get jealous or feel insecure - but it’s human.”</p>
<p>Dani, who is a self-confessed feminist, is keen for her fellow activists to realise that Playboy is celebrating women rather than degrading them.</p>
<p>She adds: “I don’t feel that Playboy is sexist at all, Playboy celebrates women and I love that.</p>
<p>“We should be highlighting the fact that I’m a model and I’m smart.</p>
<p>“Even though I’m going to be a doctor one day I can still show my body and feel comfortable in my own skin.”</p>
<p>Dani, who has been been helping out at the hospital during coronavirus, remains adamant that while she may have sacrificed the odd night out and girls&rsquo; trip away she regrets nothing about her double life.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have survived mentally if I didn’t have either or”, she says, “ It was the best of both worlds.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgrosetta.mynet.com.tr/file/12008944/12008944-700x400.jpg" alt="img">
New Jersey’de yaşayan Danielle, kötü bir trafik kazası geçirdikten sonra sağlık sektörüne girmeye karar verdi ve 10 yıl boyunca sağlık alanında bulundu.</p>
<p>“Kötü bir kaza geçirmiştim ve hastanede tüm medikal olarak yapılan her şeyi yaşadım. Geçen yıl mezun olduktan sonra kardiyografik teknisyen olarak çalıştığım sürede tüm tıp fakültelerini araştırmaya başladım&rdquo; diyen Danielle gündüz tıp eğitimi için çalışırken, geceleri de New York’ta şu an karantina nedeniyle kapalı olan Playboy kulübünde çalışıyor.</p>
<p>Modellik işinde çok para olduğunu söyleyen Danielle, fotoğraf çekimlerinde çok eğlendiğini dile getirdi. Genç kadın aynı zamanda uluslararası Playboy sayıları için poz verdi.</p>
<p>Danielle, modellik kariyerini “Playboy modeli olarak çalışmak hayatımın en iyi zamanları. Fotoğraflarımın dergilerde yayınlanması da benim için bir onur. New York’ta bir Playboy kulübü açıldı ve ben de Playboy tavşanı olarak çalışmaya başladım”sözleriyle özetledi.

Danielle Lupo is haar echte naam. Maar soms geeft de jongedame die toch liever niet prijs.</p>
<p>Ze is momenteel volop bezig met haar studies om dokteres te worden. Maar na haar schooluren, werkt ze in de Playboy Club in New York als Playboy Bunny. “Overdag ga ik naar school en werk ik in het ziekenhuis. ‘s Nachts verkleed ik me”, klinkt het.</p>
<p>Ook poseert ze als Playmate. Echter gebruikt ze voor pikante naaktshoots liever een andere naam. “De medische wereld is eerder conservatief en Playboy is uiteraard zeer open en bevrijdend”, aldus Danielle. “Ik gebruikte in het verleden soms een andere naam, omdat ik weldra dokteres word en ik niet wil dat patiënten me zouden kunnen googelen“, laat ze weten.</p>
<p>Ze ziet het momenteel niet echt zitten om te kiezen tussen de twee leefwerelden. “Ik ben blij dat ik een evenwicht heb kunnen vinden tussen beide aspecten van mijn leven en ik zou geen één van de twee ‘werelden’ kunnen opgeven”, klinkt het. Haar mama is echter niet zo’n fan van haar werk voor Playboy. “Mijn papa steunt me wel”, besluit ze.</p>

Može se reći da su to dvije potpuno suprotne grane – dok je medicina izrazito konzervativna, Playboy je očigledno slobodan i liberalan</p>
<p>Sviđalo vam se to ili ne, postoji određeni stereotip o Playboyevim zečicama – i obično nema nikakve veze s njihovom inteligencijom. Danielle Lupo, 24-godišnja zečica koja je završila medicinski fakultet i želi postati liječnica, odlučna je u nakani da je ljudi prestanu doživljavati kao prostitutku.</p>
<p>“Diplomirala sam prošle godine i sada proučavam doktorske programe dok radim kao kardiografski tehničar”, pohvalila se Dani, koja živi u New Jerseyju, u razgovoru za The Sun. No, dok danju radi u bolnici, noću ova ljepotica stavlja zečji rep i odlazi u njujorški klub Playboy, koji je trenutno zatvoren zbog pandemije koronavirusa.</p>
<p>“To je sjajan džeparac sa strane i jako sam se zabavljala radeći gomilu različitih shootinga. Upala sam u više međunarodnih izdanja Playboya. Bila mi je čast krasiti ovaj časopis, a kada se otvorio Playboyev klub u New Yorku, dobila sam i poziciju zečice”, ispričala je Lupo.</p>
<p>FAKULTET JOJ PLAĆAJU NAPALJENI FETIŠISTI: Studentica masno zarađuje od svojih – stopala; ‘Mušterije vole kad smrduckaju’</p>
<p>Ponosna je na svoje uspjehe u oba posla</p>
<p>Kako kaže, bilo joj je skroz kul noću nositi seksi kostime, a danju raditi u bolnici i pohađati fakultet. Na to je gledala kao na dva privremena posla koji joj popunjavaju raspored. “Može se reći da su to dvije potpuno suprotne grane – dok je medicina izrazito konzervativna, Playboy je očigledno slobodan i liberalan”, objasnila je.</p>
<p>Umjesto da je jedan posao sputava u drugome, Dani inzistira na tome da iz obaju izvlači samo najbolje. “Dok je klub radio, morala sam paziti da sve svoje fakultetske obveze ispunjavam u roku, kako bih potom mogla sat vremena putovati do svojega drugog, noćnog radnog mjesta.</p>
<p>To joj je, tvrdi, bilo iskustvo koje ne bi mijenjala ni za što drugo. Ponosna je na sebe jer je uspjela uravnotežiti oba aspekta svojega života. Priznaje da se ne bi mogla odreći nijednoga od njih.</p>
<p>Dani daje svoj doprinos u trenutnoj borbi s koronavirusom koliko god može, ali nisu svi veliki obožavatelji njezina drugog posla. Obitelj i prijatelji jako su se brinuli zbog njezinih odlazaka u klub.</p>
<p>DADILJA IZ PAKLA SPAVALA S 13-GODIŠNJAKOM I RODILA MU DIJETE: ‘Rekla mi je da se trebamo seksati i voljeti…’</p>
<p>Pobrinula se da je pacijenti ne vide golu</p>
<p>“Moja mama nije oduševljena činjenicom da sam Playboyeva zečica, ali zanimljivo je da mi je otac bio velika podrška. I sam je završio fakultet radeći i razumije taj aspekt. Mama je usredotočena na to da ljudima govori kako njezina kći radi u bolnici, ali izostavlja ovo drugo jer su njezini prijatelji dosta konzervativni”, rekla je Lupo.</p>
<p>Međutim, Dani ima na umu činjenicu da bi njezini prethodni izleti u karijeri mogli utjecati na njezinu budućnost kao liječnice, stoga je poduzela određene mjere opreza. “Uz svoju potpuno golu fotografiju, koju sam snimila u Češkoj, koristila sam drugo ime, jer ću jednoga dana biti liječnica i ne želim da me ljudi guglaju i vide bez odjeće”, otkrila je.</p>
<p>Kao deklarirana feministkinja, brine se da njezini kolege aktivisti shvate kako Playboy slavi žene, a ne da ih degradira. “Ne osjećam uopće da je Playboy seksistički. Playboy slavi žene i to mi se sviđa”, kazala je Dani.</p>
<p>“Iako ću jednoga dana biti liječnica, još uvijek mogu pokazati svoje tijelo i osjećati se ugodno u vlastitoj koži”, zaključila je svestrana ljepotica, koja nimalo ne žali zbog svojega dvostrukog života.

<h3 id="danielle-lupo-playboy-bunny--healthcare-pro-is-schooling-us-on-coronavirus">&ldquo;Danielle Lupo, Playboy Bunny &amp; Healthcare Pro, Is Schooling Us On Coronavirus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.guestofaguest.com/t_card_large/gofg-media/2020/04/1/53470/56821411_2135039960119652_4303325852929346513_n_(2).jpg" alt="img">
After panic-reading just about everything I could about coronavirus, I never would have guessed that some of the most solid advice about this whole thing would come from a professional Playboy Bunny, but I&rsquo;m not one to be shocked when beauty meets brains.</p>
<p>When Playmate and international model Danielle Lupo isn&rsquo;t rocking her bunny ears, you&rsquo;ll find her in a white coat as a Certified Cardiographic Technician (CCT). As a Pre-Medical, Health Science grad, Lupo has been working in the Healthcare field for almost 10 years, so she knows her stuff. From what to do if you think you have COVID-19, to how you can deal with the anxiety of it all, she&rsquo;s schooling us on everything we need to know.</p>
<p>What are some ways to boost and protect my immune system today?</p>
<p>The most important thing you can do for yourself and others in this pandemic is to stay home. For many of us, it is super tough and frustrating to do this. It is also SO important to try and keep your anxiety and stress levels low, as that can weaken the immune system and actually allow you to still get sick even from your house. (There are pesky germs that can get us sick EVERYWHERE!) This is, of course, easier said than done I’m sure, but try these different exercises to cope such as:</p>
<p>-Continue a healthy and balanced diet.</p>
<p>-Keep up the normal fluid intake.</p>
<p>-Now, more than ever is so important to nourish your body right.</p>
<p>-Spend quality time with your family and or pet that you’re quarantined with. (Playing with or petting an animal can increase levels of the stress-reducing hormone oxytocin and decrease the production of the stress hormone cortisol which ultimately can relieve anxiety and lower heart rate!)</p>
<p>-Stay active, doctors RECOMMEND going out for a walk, get some sunlight and fresh air, and of course all while staying away from others with a safe 6-foot minimum, a CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recommended distance&hellip; Getting outside is extremely helpful for your mental state during this challenging time.</p>
<p>-Also, feel free to practice some extra TLC and spoil yourself with some good ol’ self-care! Practicing healthy skincare routines and taking relaxing bubble baths are just what the doctor ordered. ;)</p>
<p>SOS! What do I do if I think I have Coronavirus?!</p>
<p>First and most of all, isolate yourself. Keep calm and review your symptoms. The symptoms of COVID-19 are: dry cough (must be associated with rising fever, otherwise irrelevant), fever, tiredness, sore muscles, chest pain, sore throat, difficulty breathing (severe cases - this can be associated with pneumonia).</p>
<p>And many other symptoms can resemble the flu, including headaches, digestive issues, body aches and fatigue, which can be severe. Still, other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a runny nose, sore throat and sneezing.</p>
<p>Take your temperature regularly and CALL your doctor BEFORE you go ANYWHERE. You may not even have it and most likely will catch it at the Hospital or test center where you are exposing yourself to a ton of already infected people without having the correct PPE (personal protective equipment). Your doctor will be able to determine by phone if you should call the ambulance or not.</p>
<p>I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! When will this all end and go back to normal already?!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one can predict that. But keep yourself updated and educated on all the facts. Sometimes things that we don’t know anything about can scare us. And that’s okay. Just know that at this point, the top researchers and doctors are on top of this. We are all doing our best here. We are hoping we are almost at the height of things and when these peaks, hoping to be sooner than later, because of all the precautions we are now taking, the spread of this infection will progressively die down and warmer weather will help the virus die off.</p>
<p>And here are some fun, maybe not so fun facts: Heat kills viruses! And sunlight helps our bodies naturally produce Vitamin D which these days spent inside can cause and or exacerbate Seasonal Depression. (SPF always recommended of course&hellip;) Focus on this information and keep reminding yourself that things WILL get better.</p>
<p>But with all this extra free time at home, what do I even do with myself?</p>
<p>No one was anticipating this. It totally blows. BUT know that successful people can take disadvantages and make them into opportunities. When I was struck by a distracted driver (do NOT text and drive) I was so injured that I had to drop out of college and quit my job as a Dental Assistant. At first, it sucked. But, I wasn’t going to let myself quit. When I was recovered enough, I was able to model again and seek out a new school and ended up finishing there with perfect grades and an awesome internship. With all that said, take this setback and re-focus. This new perspective might even lead you to learn a new language, play a new instrument, take an online course (they’re not as bad as you think!) or even reconnect with old friends and distant family. If you’re like me and hate sitting around while the world is in a crisis, pitch in with your community, look up local postings where help is needed. There are less fortunate people out there that don’t have their health or the resources that we do. Of course all while being safe by taking the proper precautions&hellip;</p>
<p>I don’t know how much longer I can hold up without seeing my friends or families, I miss them, what can I do?</p>
<p>As it is recommended to always keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and others, doctors suggest you may meet up, maybe somewhere like a park, where the area is open and thoroughly ventilated. We are also so lucky to be in an age where technology has us so (safely) connected. Remember, laughter is contagious and most famously known to “be the best medicine.” Laughing decreases stress hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies, thus improving your resistance to disease. Laughter also triggers the release of endorphins, the body&rsquo;s natural feel-good chemicals. So maybe instead of sitting on social media all day, which already triggers our anxiety, talk to a friend or watch things that make you laugh. Needless to say, we can do this! We are gonna get through this. Together.</p>
