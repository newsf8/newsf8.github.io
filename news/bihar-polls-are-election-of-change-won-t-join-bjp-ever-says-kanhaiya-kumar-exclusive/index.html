<p>As political parties in Bihar went on election rally spree on Friday, the Communist Party of India (CPI) leader, Kanhaiya Kumar, said the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls are the &ldquo;election of change&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the election of youth, but of change and people of Bihar have made up their mind to bring a change,&rdquo; Kanhaiya Kumar said in an exclusive interview to India Today TV.</p>
<p>Elaborating on his idea of leadership and elections, Kanhaiya Kumar said, &ldquo;Strategy and policies are important in politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is not about the leader, but about policies; not the face but the intentions. It is more about the character,&rdquo; Kanhaiya Kumar said.</p>
<p>Kanhaiya Kumar went on to say: &ldquo;Having a team is important. There&rsquo;s not just a captain but there are a wicketkeeper and a bowler as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked why he isn&rsquo;t contesting Bihar elections this year, Kanhaiya Kumar said that he will do what his party will decide.</p>
<p>Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Kanhaiya Kumar said, &ldquo;I said in a sarcastic way that I will join the BJP because it is that party which turns misdemeanours into virtuous like a washing machine. Even if everyone would join the BJP, I would not join it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked what he thinks about the LJP and his chief Chirag Paswan, Kanhaiya Kumar said, &ldquo;It is not possible without the support of the BJP that a party is a part of the NDA in Delhi and contest elections against it here [in Bihar]. Chirag is a young man, has talent and every right to fight the elections the way he wants to. When Chirag is a part of the NDA, then what happened on the way to Bihar from Delhi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On being compared with RJD chief Tejashwi Yadav, Kanhaiya Kumar said that the &ldquo;debate is unnecessary&rdquo;. He said that he cannot be compared to Tejashwi Yadav since his party (RJD) has 80 MLAs, is the Leader of the Opposition and he is &ldquo;not even a councillor&rdquo;.</p>

Campaigning for Mahagathbandhan in his home constituency- Begusarai, CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar on Friday, asserted the coalition&rsquo;s fight was to save democracy. Kanhaiya - who is the ex-JNU student president, is one of the 30 star-campaigners for CPI. While he has not been actively campaigning for the CM face- Tejashwi, with the Left parties allying with RJD, Kanhaiya has backed Tejashwi&rsquo;s candidacy saying &lsquo;no question about it&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Kanhaiya Kumar opines on Mahagathbandhan&rsquo;s CM face Tejashwi Yadav ahead of Bihar elections</p>
<p>Kanhaiya on Tejashwi</p>
<p>On October 16, when asked about Tejashwi, Kanhaiya Kumar said, &ldquo;he is the leader of the largest constituent of the coalition so, it&rsquo;s natural that he will be the leader and there is no question about it.&rdquo; Notably, former JNUSU general secretary, Sandeep Saurav, has been fielded by CPI-ML, also a member of the grand alliance, from the Paliganj assembly seat. Kumar himself has not been fielded by the CPI. Vikash Mandal (Rupauli), Ramnaresh Pandey (Harlakhi), Suryakant Paswan (Bakhri), Ram Ratan Singh (Teghra), Abdhesh Kumar Ray (Bachhwara) and Ramnarayan Yadav (Jhanjharpur) have been named as the CPI candidates.</p>

<p>The Mahagathbandhan anointed Tejashwi Yadav as the &lsquo;face of Mahagathbandhan&rsquo;, presumably their CM candidate. The Mahagathbandhan has decided the seat share as such - RJD (144 seats), Congress (70 seats + Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha bypoll), CPM (4 seats), CPI (6 seats), CPM (4 seats), CPI-ML (19 seats). The RJD&rsquo;s seat share includes seats in which Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) party&rsquo;s seats. The VIP jumped ship and joined the NDA.</p>

<p>The NDA- led by BJP poll-in-charge Devendra Fadnavis will contest on a 121-122 seat share with JDU, while LJP has decided to contest separately, but is open to a post-poll alliance. The NDA and Mahagathbandhan face three coalitions - &lsquo;Progressive Democratic Alliance&rsquo; (PDA) - comprising of JAP, AJP, SDP, BMP, and Grand Democratic Secular Front - comprising of AIMIM, RLSP, BSP, SJDD and SBSP. Bihar will vote in 3 phases - October 28, November 3, and November 7, with the results being declared on November 10.

<h3 id="its-not-a-referendum-on-modi-absolutely-not-the-anger-is-against-nitish">&ldquo;‘It’s not a referendum on Modi, absolutely not… the anger is against Nitish’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/10/kanhaiya-1.jpg" alt="img">
CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar leaves for an election campaign rally ahead of Bihar assembly polls, in Patna. [PTI]</p>
<p>ONE-AND-A-HALF years after his very public contest with Union minister of state Giriraj Singh on the Begusarai Lok Sabha seat, CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar made a very quiet appearance in Patna on Monday.</p>
<p>Word is that he will start campaigning soon — the CPI is contesting the polls as part of the Mahagathbandhan. However, like much about Kanhaiya lately, there is no clarity on how many rallies, and for whom in the alliance.</p>
<p>Kanhaiya’s silence is particularly striking since he had stormed into national limelight as the firebrand former president of the JNU Students’ Union, defiant in the face of the government’s sedition charges. Early this year, Kanhaiya was part of rallies against the CAA across Bihar, drawing enthusiastic crowds.</p>
<p>Seeking to build a political career from home state Bihar, Kanhaiya appears to be toning down his polarising image, which leaves him not just open to attacks by the BJP but also makes allies uncomfortable. On Twitter, where he has a massive following, he has been accused of being silent on so-called anti-national issues and has been talking of jobs, Babri verdict, and attacking the Modi government’s policies.</p>
<p>In the web series The Lallantop aired earlier this month, he said he owned the charge of being the “sargana (leader)” of “tukde-tukde gang”, as alleged in the JNU case, but that what he was fighting against were people trying to break the nation. He also contested the anti-national charge.</p>
<p>Asked if he was deliberately keeping a low profile this time, Kanhaiya told The Indian Express, “I have always been low-profile.” He said he saw his role in this election as being part of an alliance to ensure that the “anti-BJP votes are not divided”. “The biggest challenge before us is that when Nitish is getting weakened, the BJP might directly capture power in Bihar,” he said.</p>
<p>Read full interview here.</p>
<p>One of Kanhaiya’s friends admitted that the new image is “part of a strategy”, to make him acceptable beyond his loyal fans who include activists, Muslims, Dalits and youths.</p>
<p>For the coming election, Kanhaiya’s oratorical skills could be used by the Grand Alliance in selective areas, especially with sizeable Muslim populations. Sources said several RJD candidates have made it clear that they do not want the CPI leader campaigning for them. Sources also said there would be none of the “azadi” slogans associated with him in Kanhaiya’s speeches.</p>
<p>Kanhaiya told The Indian Express the Opposition should be careful about not building its politics around responding to the BJP’s agenda. “They will raise a mandir issue, a masjid issue… The Opposition should have agitations, movements, political programmes. It should not be that you react and stay silent… So if there is a Hindu-Muslim (issue), as a political party you have to give a response. Give a response but consistently raise issues of farmers, unemployment, security of women, atrocities.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Kanhaiya was emphatic that the Bihar polls were not a referendum on the Modi government. “No, absolutely not. In the political discourse, the entire attack is on Nitish Kumar. The anger and discontent are against Nitish… Yes, if the BJP wins, they will project it as a victory of Modi to cover up the failure during the lockdown. (But) this poll is for Bihar and is centred on Bihar.”</p>
<p>Asked about RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav being the CM candidate of the Grand Alliance, Kanhaiya said it was natural as he was the leader of the largest party, adding, “The question of who will be the CM if we get a majority is not that important for us.” Kanhaiya also noted that the crowds Tejashwi is drawing are impressive. “The response is good. The youth are supporting him.”</p>
<p>Tejashwi has so far kept his distance from Kanhaiya, seeing in the CPI leader’s crowd-pulling abilities a challenger for the spot of next-generation leader of Bihar. In the 2019 elections, the RJD had refused to support the CPI’s ticket to Kanhaiya from Begusarai. Without the RJD’s backing, Kanhaiya had come a distant second — underlining that he needed a larger platform. Those close to Kanhaiya hint that he is open to joining other parties in the Opposition camp.</p>
<p>Asked about LJP chief Chirag Paswan, another contender for future Bihar leader, Kanhaiya said he saw nothing wrong in him choosing to go alone. “When we have a multi-party system, how can you call one party a vote-splitter of another?”</p>
<p>Rajan Jha, an assistant professor at Delhi University, said there is another reason Tejashwi might feel threatened by Kanhaiya. “Kanhaiya is poor but upper caste and Tejashwi is rich but from a backward caste. If Kanhaiya comes to the centre of Bihar politics, it may break the stalemate of Bihar politics.”</p>
<p>In April, Kanhaiya told this reporter he would not contest the 2020 Assembly polls. As for 2025, he deftly parried the question.</p>

<p>Updated: Oct 20, 2020, 19:45 IST</p>
<p>While top politicians have been campaigning extensively in Bihar for the coming assembly elections, CPI’s star campaigner and former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar has kept a low profile.</p>
<p>Till date, the 33-year-old leader, who unsuccessfully contested against Union minister Giriraj Singh from Begusarai in the 2019 parliamentary polls, has addressed only three public meetings &ndash; at Bakhri, Teghra (both in Begusarai district) and Benipatti in Madhubani respectively &ndash; since October 12.</p>
<p>While party insiders said Kanhaiya’s schedule for the second and the third phase is not yet final, indicating he might address a few more rallies, his absence from the campaign has only given currency to several theories.</p>
<p>ALSO READ | State Congress sidelined as AICC takes control of poll preparations</p>
<p>There is a perception that this is being done as per a tacit understanding between RJD and the Left party to ensure that Kanhaiya’s mass appeal does not overshadow RJD’s chief ministerial face Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who is also the face of the RJD-Congress-Left grand alliance( GA). The 31-year-old Yadav scion has been addressing six to seven back-to-back rallies for the past few days.</p>
<p>“We do not know whether Kanhaiya would campaign jointly with Tejashwi. The party is deciding the campaign schedule and Kanhaiya goes wherever he is asked to. His schedule for next few days is being prepared,” said Dhananjay, a close associate of the CPI leader.</p>
<p>Dhananjay , however, refuted the theories that Kanhaiya was maintaining a low profile as part of some sort of understanding between RJD and left parties to ensure that Tejashwi remains in spotlight. “ These are just speculations.There are demands for Kanhaiya from RJD and GA candidates but he is following the party’s instructions,” he said.</p>

<p>There is also a buzz that Kanhaiya, whose rise in the CPI has been meteoric, is apparently not happy with the old brigade taking centre stage following the change of guard at the state organisation after the death of state president Satyanarain Singh two months ago.</p>
<p>Sources said it was Singh who had backed Kanhaiya to revive the party’s sagging fortunes and went on to say that “if RJD has Tejashwi, CPI has Kanhaiya” at a party rally in Gandhi Maidan before the 2019 polls. In 2019, RJD had fielded its nominee against Kanhaiya from Begusarai.</p>
<p>Party insiders said the demise of Singh just before the assembly polls has seen a steady marginalisation of the youth camp in the party, much to the discomfiture of Kanhaiya.</p>
<p>Recently, several youth leaders, including members of AISF( All India Students Wing) , an outfit in which Kanhaiya was active in his JNU days, had held a demonstration outside the state CPI office protesting against the selection of party candidates in this election, sources said. The protests were also against state unit president Ram Naresh Pandey, who is a party veteran, reports said.</p>
<p>CPI is contesting six seats:</p>
<p>“There are internal contradictions within the CPI and Kanhaiya is facing resistance from a section of the party over his growing stature. It is believed to be one reason why he has not actively campaigned in this election,” said a senior Left party leader, wishing not to be quoted.</p>
<p>He also said Kanhaiya’s Jan Gan yatra – a statewide tour of Bihar against CAA/NRC backed by Left and opposition parties - did not get the traction the CPI had expected, resulting in the party changing its track to count more on senior leaders. “The lockdown affected the party in spreading its base in Bihar ahead of the polls,” agreed a youth leader of the CPI.</p>
<p>Party’s state president, Pandey, who filed his nomination from Harlakhi seat, could not be reached for comments due to network issues. “Kanhaiya is in big demand for campaigning. There is a coordination committee of RJD, Congress and Left parties which decides the campaigning schedule&hellip;These are baseless theories that Kanhaiya is being sidelined,” said Indu Bhushan, a senior state CPI leader. When contacted, Kanhaiya conveyed through a text message that he was busy in a meeting and would talk later.

bihar-election</p>
<p>Updated: Oct 11, 2020, 18:54 IST</p>
<p>The Left parties have roped in former and present Jawaharlal Nehru Students Union (JNUSU) office-bearers, Delhi University and Hyderabad’s student union leaders besides CPI and CPI (ML) politburo members and senior party leaders to campaign for their candidates, just like the procedure followed during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>The Left parties’ strategy of reaching out to voters is on the lines of the strategy they had adopted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to campaign for CPI candidate and former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar who lost to BJP’s Giriraj Singh. Kanhaiya will also campaign for GA candidates in the Bihar assembly polls.</p>
<p>The Left parties, including CPI (ML), CPI and CPI-M, are partners of the Grand Alliance (GA), whose major constituents are RJD and Congress. Under the seat-sharing pact, the RJD has got 144 seats, Congress 70 and Left parties 29. The CPI-ML has got 19 seats, CPI six and CPI-M four.</p>
<p>In its list submitted to the Election Commission of India (ECI), the CPI (ML) has given a list of 15 star campaigners, which include party’s general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, politburo member Kavita Krishnan, national president of AISA and former JNUSU president N Sai Balaji, party’s central committee member Raju Yadav, ex-MLA of Obra (Aurangabad) Rajaram Singh besides Swadesh Bhattarcharya, state secretary Kunal among others.</p>
<p>Krishnan was joint secretary of JNUSU in 1995 and was among the protesters who had marched to Bihar Bhawan to protest the killing of student leader Chandrashekhar Prasad allegedly by the goons of RJD leader Mohammad Sahabuddin in 1997 at Siwan.</p>
<p>Left parties have vouched for seats where they have mass support and they have stated that their aim is only to defeat the NDA. They are also targeting young voters in their respective constituencies.</p>
<p>“The youth are unanimous over the issue of rising unemployment, failing democracy and education,” claimed former JNUSU general secretary and ML’s candidate from Paliganj, Sandeep Saurav, at a press conference on Sunday.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CPI-M has submitted a list of 30 star campaigners to its central committee, which has its popular leaders like party general secretary Sitaram Yechury, politburo members Hanan Mollah and SR Pillai, senior leader Brinda Karat, state secretary Awadesh Kumar, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh besides Hyderabad student union leader Abhishek Nandan among others.</p>
<p>Ghosh had catapulted to national news after she was allegedly hit with an iron rod by masked goons in JNU campus early this year.</p>
<p>The CPI in a press release issued on Sunday came out with its list of 30 star campaigners, which, besides Kanhaiya, has party’s general secretary D Raja, state secretary and candidate from Harlakhi (Darbhanga) Ram Naresh Pandey, national secretary Atul Kumar Anjan, Amarjeet Kaur, Ramendra Kumar among others.

<h3 id="bihar-assembly-elections--opposition-merely-reacting-to-ndas-agendas-kanhaiya-kumar">&ldquo;Bihar Assembly elections | Opposition merely reacting to NDA’s agendas: Kanhaiya Kumar&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vln0qo/article29802909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL25-KANHAIYAKUMAR" alt="img">
The CPI leader said that unfortunately the agendas which were relevant to the State 15 years back continue to dominate the present polls</p>
<p>Taking a swipe at the ruling NDA in Bihar, CPI leader and former JNU students union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Wednesday said unfortunately the agendas which were relevant to the State 15 years back continue to dominate the present polls.</p>
<p>He lamented that in the ongoing polls in Bihar, the ruling coalition is setting the agendas and the opposition is only reacting to it instead of coming out with their own issues.</p>
<p>CPI is part of the RJD-led Grand Alliance in the Bihar elections. The left party is contesting on six seats in all three phases of the election as partner of the anti-NDA grouping.</p>
<p>Though Mr Kumar, who unsuccessfully contested 2019 General Election from his native Begusarai Lok Sabha seat, is not fighting the State elections, but he has been named among the star campaigners of his party for the polls.</p>
<p>Former JNUSU general secretary, Sandeep Saurav, has been fielded by CPI-ML, also a member of the grand alliance, from the Paliganj assembly seat in the outskirts of Patna.</p>
<p>Its yet not confirmed whether Kanhaiya Kumar as leader of the opposition grouping would seek vote for him at Paliganj.</p>
<p>Making a scathing attack on the Nitish Kumar government, the prominent youth leader said “even after ruling the State for 15 years he failed to solve the problems in the fields of education, health and other core sectors&hellip;Bihar still stands on the same position as it did 15 years ago in terms of development.”</p>
<p>The CPI leader’s jibe seems directed at puncturing the claims of Nitish Kumar of bringing an alround development in the State in last 15 years under him.</p>
<p>“The issues pertaining to basic needs of the people which were relevant in elections 15 years ago continue to dominate the political arena even in this election,” the former Jawaharlal Nehru University students union president told PTI-Bhasha in an interview.</p>
<p>“The ruling side is setting the agendas in the current State election and the opposition parties are merely reating to it. Opposition should set their own alternative agendas,” he said.</p>
<p>Coming down heavily on the NDA coalition at the Centre as well as in Bihar, the CPI leader said “through headline management they are diverting attention of the people from the basic issues guiding citizens daily lives.”</p>
<p>‘Utter confusion in ruling alliance’</p>
<p>Apparently refering to LJP which is contesting on its own in the Bihar polls with a promise to defeat the JD(U) and form the next government in the State with the BJP, he said “there is utter confusion in the ruling alliance as who is with whom and who is against whom.”</p>
<p>Asked if he accepts Tejashwi Yadav as the leader of the opposition grouping, he said “he is leader of the largest constituent of the coalition so it’s natural that he will be the leader and there is no question about it.”</p>
<p>At the joint press conference of the Mahagathbandhan in Patna recently where seat-sharing deal among the partners was made public, all the member parties had backed Lalu Prasad’s younger son Tejashwi Yadav as the chief miniterial candidate of the grand alliance.

After being absent from the political scene for around two months, CPI leader and former JNU student union president Kanhaiya Kumar re-appeared on September 16 and released a statement accusing the government of &lsquo;political witch hunt&rsquo; against activists and journalists. However, with days left for Bihar elections, Kanhaiya has been away from the campaign scenario and has not even been vocal about the polls on his Twitter handle. Though he had held &ldquo;Jan Gan Man Yatra&rdquo; in February this year and had toured the state extensively, he was away from the poll scene of CPI, till the party named him as a star campaigner. Left parties are contesting the upcoming elections with Mahagathbandhan-led by RJD.</p>
<p>With 12 days left for the elections, Kanhaiya Kumar has opined that the ruling coalition is setting the agendas and the opposition is only reacting to it instead of coming out with their own issues. He lamented that the agendas which were relevant to the state 15 years back continue to dominate the present polls. Kanhaiya, while speaking to PTI, said that Opposition should set their own alternative agendas.</p>
<p>When asked about Tejashwi Yadav - who is the CM face for Mahagathbandhan, &ldquo;he is the leader of the largest constituent of the coalition so, it&rsquo;s natural that he will be the leader and there is no question about it.&rdquo; Notably, former JNUSU general secretary, Sandeep Saurav, has been fielded by CPI-ML, also a member of the grand alliance, from the Paliganj assembly seat.</p>

<p>Seat-sharing formula</p>
<p>Out of the other Mahagatbandhan seats, Congress, RJD, CPI(M-L), CPI and CPM shall field candidates from 70, 144, 19, 6 and 4 constituencies each. Contrary to the initial announcement, JMM has not been allocated any seats from RJD&rsquo;s quota. Earlier in the day, it was revealed that CPI(M-L) candidates will fight the election from Paliganj, Arrah, Agiaon, Tarari, Dumraon, Karakat, Arwal, Ghosi, Bhore, Ziradei, Darauli, Daraundi, Digha, Phulwari, Sikta, Balrampur, Aurai, Kalyanpur and Warisnagar. Vikash Mandal (Rupauli), Ramnaresh Pandey (Harlakhi), Suryakant Paswan (Bakhri), Ram Ratan Singh (Teghra), Abdhesh Kumar Ray (Bachhwara) and Ramnarayan Yadav (Jhanjharpur) have been named as the CPI candidates. For the CPM, Rajmangal Kushwaha, Satyendra Yadav Manjhi, Ajay Kumar and Rajendra Prasad Singh will contest from Pipra, Manjhi, Bibhutipur, and Matihani respectively. Bihar will vote in 3 phases - October 28, November 3, and November 7, with the results being declared on November 10.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s Bihar elections will witness the clash of as many as five alliances. The ruling JDU-BJP is contesting along with Mukesh Sahni&rsquo;s VIP and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi&rsquo;s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), while LJP has decided to go solo. The Mahagathbandhan led by RJD has lost many key allies and is contesting with Congress and three left parties, with Lalu Yadav&rsquo;s son Tejashwi as CM face.</p>
<p>On 28 September, Pappu Yadav who is eyeing a comeback in politics of Bihar stitched an alliance of his party Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) with Chandrashekhar Azad&rsquo;s Azad Samaj Party&rsquo;, MK Faizi&rsquo;s Social Democratic Party and Bahujan Mukti Party. They named it the Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA). On the other side, confident after his party&rsquo;s victory in byelections, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has teamed up with Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP, Mayawati&rsquo;s BSP, Devendra Yadav&rsquo;s SJDD, and SBSP as the &lsquo;Grand Democratic Secular Front&rsquo; to contest the upcoming polls.</p>
