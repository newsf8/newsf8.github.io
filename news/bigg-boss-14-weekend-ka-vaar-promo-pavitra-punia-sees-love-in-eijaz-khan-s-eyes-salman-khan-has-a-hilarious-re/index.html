<p>Eijaz Khan and Pavitra Punia are seen dialling up the romance in a new promo video for the Bigg Boss 14 Weekend Ka Vaar episode. Host Salman Khan asks them to look into each other’s eyes and say what they see. “Romance dikhayi de raha hai aapko aankhon mein (Can you see romance in her eyes)?,” Salman asks Eijaz.</p>
<p>“Eijaz ki aankhon mein mujhe ek cute sa bachcha dikhayi deta hai jo bohot cute sa hai. Badtameez bhi hai thoda sa. Aankhon mein pyaar dikhayi deta hai (In Eijaz’s eyes, I see a little child who is very cute. He is a little rude too. I see love in his eyes),” Pavitra says.</p>
<p>Salman then pulls Pavitra’s leg and asks, “Aankhon se itni saari cheezein pata chal jaata hai aap logon ko (You can make out all these things just by looking into each other’s eyes)?”</p>
<p>Colors TV shared the promo on Instagram and wrote, “Ghar ka maahaul hua romantic jab @eijazkhan aur @pavitrapunia_ ne ki aankhon se baate (The atmosphere in the house turned romantic when Eijaz and Pavitra spoke through their eyes).”</p>

<p>In the past, Pavitra has expressed her fondness for Eijaz. She earlier told Rubina Dilaik that she tried her best to forge a connection with him but felt that he does not reciprocate her feelings. “I felt emotionally connected to this person because I see that loneliness in him somewhere. I don’t want to lose him,” she had said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two wild card contestants - television actors Kavita Kaushik and Naina Singh - are set to enter Bigg Boss 14 this weekend. A new promo shared online by Colors TV shows them battling each other in a fierce dance-off. According to reports, they will be joined by another wild card contestant but the identity of the third person has been kept under wraps for now.</p>

Bigg Boss 14’s Sara Gurpal says Eijaz Khan thought of her as a sister: ‘I don’t think his liking towards me had some other meaning’</p>
<p>tv</p>
<p>Updated: Oct 23, 2020, 21:00 IST</p>
<p>Punjabi actor and singer Sara Gurpal opened up about actor Eijaz Khan’s affection for her on Bigg Boss 14 and said that he saw her as a younger sister. She added that he has a ‘pure heart’ and that she supports him.</p>
<p>During an earlier episode of Bigg Boss 14, Eijaz said that he liked Sara because she was always happy and cheerful. “Usko ekdum aisa hug karne ka dil karta hai, bahut cute hai (I feel like hugging her, she is very cute),” he had said.</p>
<p>In an interview with SpotboyE, Sara said that Eijaz had platonic feelings towards her. “Arre nahi, honestly he used to call me chhoti. In fact, he also told me ki tum jaoge to main apni choti behan ko miss karunga (No, honestly, he used to call me ‘little one’. In fact, he also told me that if you leave, I will miss my younger sister). He had a pure heart. I don’t think his liking towards me had some other meaning,” she said.</p>
<p>“Like when eviction was supposed to happen, we all were sitting and discussing agar hum gaye to usme kya miss karenge and that’s when he said agar ye chali gayi to main choti behan ko miss karunga (if we leave, who will miss us and he said that if I leave, he will miss his younger sister),” she added.</p>

<p>Sara was the first contestant to be evicted from Bigg Boss 14. The decision was in the hands of ‘seniors’ Sidharth Shukla, Gauahar Khan and Hina Khan. She has claimed that her eviction was ‘unfair’.</p>
<p>Talking to Hindustan Times about the possibility of her returning to the Bigg Boss house as a wild card contestant, Sara had said, “Time will tell. If I go, I will go with full courage and show Sidharth I don’t deserve to be outside Bigg Boss 14 but inside. If I get a chance, I will definitely go. But jab tak inka khud ka sort nahi hota ki inka kya chal raha hai (until they sort out what is happening), I have no idea about the wild card entry.”</p>

New friendships are seen somewhere in Bigg Boss 14’s house, so there is enmity. The equations among people often change in this house. During the weekend, Salman Khan kept the definition of friendship of life in front of Nikki Tamboli. After which Nikki is very angry with her life. After this, Salman Khan gives a task to Ijaz Khan, Pavitra Punia, Nikki Tamboli and Jan Kumar Sanu.</p>
<p>In the task, Ejaz Khan and Pavitra Punia are looking into each other’s eyes and telling what they see in each other’s eyes. Ijaz says that ‘in the eyes of Pavitra, he is seen as a man. Friendship is also visible and there is enmity too. At the same time, Pavitra says that in the eyes of Aijaz, a small child is seen. Which is very cute. Still not childish It is also a bit insolent. But very cute. Love is seen in the eyes.</p>
<p>Then comes the turn after both Jan and Nikki look at each other’s eyes. Jaan speaks’ Love and friendship are only visible. Right now a lot of anger and questions are showing. The childishness is visible to the head. Attitude is also visible. For now, it seems that if something had happened in her eyes now, she would have thrown and killed her. Nikki says’ I can see how deceitful these people are. What a bastard. What a liar. Used to play so much for friendship. To be honest, my friends are not such bastards. I do not even want to see much.

I was very confused why she raised the point of getting hurt by Salman Khan sir&rsquo;s comment because it was said in a very fun way. During the &lsquo;Dimaag Mein Kachra&rsquo; waala task also Jasmin and I tried our best to make her understand that it was just a task and it should be taken that way only. I really thought it was pointless to raise that Kachra task and Salman sir&rsquo;s point. Rubina is very opinionated but when she raises points like these the purpose of raising a point goes waste. This is a game show, it has an entertainment factor and it has happened in previous shows also. I had tried to make her understand by giving examples but she was not ready to understand. Eventually, Salman sir also tried to explain her but she was adamant on her point. I felt weird at that time and I asked myself why is she behaving like this? I made things clear also with her. Then I saw her raising Salman sir&rsquo;s point which we didn&rsquo;t even notice, nobody even remembered that thing. It was said in a jest. Salman sir mazak mein sabki leg pull karte hain. It was all in the entertainment zone, he is loved for his humour and that is his charm. People love him for his witty style of hosting. When she raised the point with Bigg Boss we all were in the house and she was in the confession room. We didn&rsquo;t even know that something of this sort happened. When I came out I saw the episodes, I got to know about it and I found it very baseless. If she was really offended by that point she should have raised it then and there, but she didn&rsquo;t because she was already schooled on the kachra task and she didn&rsquo;t want to take a risk. Otherwise, Rubina&rsquo;s reading about a person and her points are always very accurate. (Photo: Instagram)</p>

<p><img src="https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-78826252,imgsize-59783/pic.jpg" alt="img">
Actor Ejaz Khan is always in the headlines due to his controversial statements. Earlier, Ejaz Khan was arrested for uploading communal videos and abusing and was then released on bail. Now another video of him is going viral on social media and people are demanding his arrest.</p>
<p>Actually the video of Ejaz which went viral was uploaded last year. In this video, Ejaz Brahmins are seen using profanity for community and pundits. The incident on which this video was made also took place last year and the police denied any communal angle in the investigation. Now this video has once again gone viral.</p>
<p>After this video of Ijaz went viral, social media users’ anger has erupted on Ijaz and he is demanding his immediate arrest. BJP leader Kapil Mishra has also tweeted after this video went viral. Kapil Mishra, in his tweet, demanded the arrest of Ejaz, wrote, ‘Apology is not possible after what Ejaz Khan has said. There is terrible anger among the people. Immediate legal action against him is the only option. I hope that the state government and law and order authorities will understand its seriousness soon.

When Bigg Boss 14 contestant Eijaz Khan opened up on the rape case against him in 2018 interview: Here’s everything you need to know</p>
<p>tv</p>

<p>Actor and Bigg Boss 14 contestant Eijaz Khan has confessed on the show that he faced rape charges years ago, and host Salman Khan and co-contestant Sidharth Shukla discussed the issue with him over the weekend.</p>
<p>However, this is not the first time that Eijaz has spoken about the case. He had earlier opened up about it on a chat show hosted by his close friend, actor Rajeev Khandelwal. Speaking on the chat show JuzzBatt, Eijaz had said in 2018, “Due to some reasons, she shifted to my apartment and we got into a relationship. But I realised after few months that it was not what I wanted. I started telling her that it was not meant to be. But she got carried away and tried to file a police complaint against me because of which I could not attend Tanu Weds Manu promotions. I had to leave Mumbai for a couple of days because of that.” Eijaz also said that the woman even took away his pet dogs.</p>
<p>Eijaz’s actor girlfriend had filed a case of physical abuse against him in 2011. A Mumbai Mirror report said that the complaint mentioned Eijaz’s abusive behaviour and claimed that he would “often get angry and beat her up.”</p>
<p>However, she later withdrew the complaint and the tabloid quoted her as saying, “Yes, we had an ugly tiff which got out of hand. But things have been sorted out now and everything is normal between us. I have gone back to stay with him and it was a normal fight like any other couple would have.” Eijaz had also told the daily back in 2011, “I don’t discuss personal matters with anyone but on that day we had a small argument.”</p>
<p>On Saturday’s episode, Eijaz was seen telling Sidharth that he is often restrained when women are around because of an incident that happened with him in 2011. He then went ahead and discussed the case. “I used to help all women and protect those that needed it. There was one such and later I was charged with rape because I promised I’d marry her but didn’t. She made it into a rape case and I had to go to jail,” he said.</p>

<p>Eijaz also said that the incident broke him, especially when his father was ready to take all the blame and go to jail. The actor also said that he had to skip the premiere of his film Tanu Weds Manu and move to Dharamshala for some time.</p>
<p>After playing the clip, Salman also told Eijaz, “Aap galat jaoge to galat dikhoge, but agar sahi ho to sahi ho na (If you go the wrong way, you will come across as inappropriate, but if you play well, you will be respected).” Eijaz then told Salman, “I know I am right but I am awkward and often cross-check. I am extra conscious.” Salman responded saying, “Happens with everyone. Why are you scared? We are with you.”</p>
