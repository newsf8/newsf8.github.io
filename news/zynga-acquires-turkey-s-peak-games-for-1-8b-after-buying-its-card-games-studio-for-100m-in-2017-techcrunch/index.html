<p>Today, some news of a huge acquisition out of Turkey that represents the first billion-dollar-plus exit for a startup out of the country. Social gaming company Zynga confirmed that it is buying Istanbul-based Peak Games, the company behind popular Candy-Crush-style mobile gaming apps Toon Blast and Toy Blast, for $1.8 billion — $900 million in cash, and $900 million in Zynga shares.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is the second time that Zynga has made a Peak Games acquisition. In 2017, it purchased the company’s mobile card games business for $100 million (more on that below).</p>
<p>The news caps off a short period of speculation about an upcoming deal, with local tech publications like Webrazzi calling the sale (and correct price) last month.</p>
<p>Peak’s investors had included European VCs Earlybird and Hummingbird Ventures — both active backers of startups in emerging markets in the region — and Endeavor Global (the nonprofit that invests via its Endeavor Catalyst fund). Sidar Sahin, the founder and CEO, had been the company’s biggest shareholder.</p>
<p>As with all M&amp;A in the world of gaming, Zynga is getting a couple of big gains out of this sale.</p>
<p>The first is picking up two very popular titles/franchises that it doesn’t have do develop from scratch (in hopes of investing R&amp;D budget in what it hopes but can’t guarantee will be a hit). Toon Blast and Toy Blast together total more than 12 million DAUs. And on top of that, those two games are some of the highest-grossing among all in Apple’s App Store, ranking among the top-10 and top-20 games in the past two years, Zynga noted in its announcement.</p>
<p>It’s not just about adding popular games content, but expanding Zynga’s advertising business as well. Significantly, Peak Games’ primary users are outside of Zynga’s home market of the US, representing a real growth opportunity for the company to cross-sell other games. Zynga says that bolting on Peak’s games network to its own will boost its number of mobile daily active users by 60%, which mean a lot of scaling up for its ad network.</p>
<p>Of course, sustaining both of those titles and their respective franchises as hits for the long run is not a given — the world of gaming regularly sees blockbusters fizzle out when the next big thing comes along — although these “forever franchises” with their steady popularity have a strong play to be exactly that.</p>
<p>However, the long play is also where the third big asset comes in: talent. Peak has 100 employees working on its current franchises and other games. So while the back ends (and revenues) may be getting combined, Zynga says Peak’s people will stay put and continue to work under the Peak brand on the existing franchises as well as on new projects that are already in development.</p>
<p>Zynga says the deal will close in the third quarter of 2020, and it’s updated its guidance already on the news, sending its stock up more than 5% in pre-market trading. Specifically, Zynga today said it believes the deal will bump up revenues by $40 million for the year, to $1.840 billion.</p>
<p>A startup so nice, Zynga bought it twice</p>
<p>The deal is notable not just because of what it’s adding to Zynga today, but because it highlights some interesting history between the two companies.</p>
<p>Back in November 2017, Zynga acquired one division of Peak Games, its mobile card games studio, for $100 million in cash.</p>
<p>The deal included games like Spades Plus and Gin Rummy Plus, respectively the largest spade and rummy mobile games in the world at the time; and games that were popular in Peak’s home market, 101 Okey Plus and Okey Plus. And according to analysis from Apptopia, it looks like Zynga was set to recoup the money it paid out by 2019, meaning that business is now profitable.</p>
<p>The remainder of Peak Games is another story. If Zynga tried to buy the whole business two years ago, it might have been that Peak was reluctant to sell its remaining two titles — its own Candy Crush crushers — Toon Blast and Toy Blast for anything near $100 million. And with good reason, since (as Zynga itself pointed out) they went on to become some of the consistently highest-grossing games in all of the App Store.</p>
<p>In the intervening period, Zynga tried to create its own rivals, namely Wonka’s World of Candy, but it’s never been as big of a hit as the others. (Apptopia’s Adam Blacker today told me, after I published this piece, that in fact Wonka’s World has made but a tiny fraction of the revenue of Peak’s titles.)</p>
<p>Hence, two years on, Zynga possibly finally found the “right price” for the whole of Peak Games.</p>
<p>“We are honored to welcome Sidar and team to Zynga. Peak is one of the world’s best puzzle game makers and we could not be more excited to add such creative and passionate talent to our company,” said Frank Gibeau, Chief Executive Officer of Zynga, in a statement. “With the addition of Toon Blast and Toy Blast, we are expanding our live services portfolio to eight forever franchises, meaningfully increasing our global audience base and adding to our exciting new game pipeline. As a combined team, we are well positioned to grow faster together.”</p>
<p>“This is a monumental partnership not only for Zynga and Peak, but for the whole mobile gaming industry,” said Sidar Sahin, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Peak, in a statement. “Both companies share a common vision — to bring people together through games. Peak’s culture is rooted in relentless learning and progress, so as we embark on this new chapter in our journey together with Zynga, we remain as committed as ever to our unique culture. We’re very excited for our combined future and what we will accomplish together.”</p>
<p>Zynga and games business strategies aside, this is also a huge deal for Turkey’s tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>Turkey has been a steady presence straddling both the European and MENA markets (much as Turkey’s wider economy and political presence does), but so far with little impact in terms of exits and activity that extend outside of the region.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a testament to the exciting companies and talent that are being developed in the market, and is of course yet another sign of how big tech companies based out of more established centres like the Bay Area will continue to take bigger leaps to tap talent ever further afield, in their ongoing consolidation push and search for both business and audience growth.</p>
<p>One impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been that many are starting to see a much faster decentralisation in the world of technology. People are working remotely, and some are even planning to move away from tech hubs; and deals are getting done not in person but over videoconferencing links. This acquisition also demonstrates how that is also playing out in the world of M&amp;A, too.

<h3 id="20-best-stocks-to-invest-in-during-this-recession">&ldquo;20 Best Stocks to Invest In During This Recession&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?2142897227" alt="img">
As a general rule, the best stocks to invest in while the economy is plunged in a recession tend to be boring, get-the-job-done companies.</p>
<p>They have to be. In a recession, there&rsquo;s typically not a lot of money for much else.</p>
<p>While it usually takes six months to determine a recession has actually occurred, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research took far less time before recently confirming that the U.S. indeed entered a recession in February.</p>
<p>Kiplinger&rsquo;s economic forecast is for a second-quarter drop in GDP of about 30% to 40%, and while we expect &ldquo;a pretty good rebound in the second half of the year &hellip; full recovery is likely to take until the end of 2021.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes the world economy will remain in a weakened state all year, with GDP contracting 3% - well below its January projection of 3.3% growth - before rebounding with 5.8% growth in 2021.</p>
<p>The companies best suited to survive, if not thrive, in this kind of environment, are defensive stocks that provide products and services people simply can&rsquo;t live without.</p>
<p>Here, then, are 20 best stocks to invest in during a recession. Some of these might not be the greatest stocks to hold once the U.S. and global economies have returned to normal. But all of them have loads of worth - to investors and consumers alike - as long as times are tight.</p>
<p>Walmart</p>
<p>Market value: $343.4 billion</p>
<p>Dividend yield: 1.8%</p>
<p>Analysts&rsquo; opinion: 19 Strong Buy, 6 Buy, 7 Hold, 1 Sell, 1 Strong Sell</p>
<p>Walmart (WMT, $121.24) CEO Doug McMillion appeared on The Today Show on April 10 to discuss coronavirus-sparked panic buying. First, consumers ordered food and other consumables. Then, they turned to entertainment items such as jigsaw puzzles and board games. Now, they&rsquo;re ordering hair coloring and beard trimmers.</p>
<p>All of these are things that you can buy at Walmart. Thus while many companies have suffered tremendous financial hardship during this crisis, Walmart was among the major U.S. corporations actually hiring en masse to keep up with increased demand. Specifically, WMT plans on hiring 150,000 new workers, and it might need to expand past that. Of those jobs, about 80% to 85% are temporary in nature. However, that still means as many as 22,500 people could stay with Walmart on a permanent basis once the crisis ends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good for employees. That&rsquo;s good for the employer.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, Slate magazine wondered why Walmart was thriving while the economy was tanking. The answer: Consumers could no longer afford to trade up; they were forced to survive by trading down. The 2020 recession could spark a similar trend, putting more money in the Walton family&rsquo;s bank accounts.</p>
<p>During the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, Walmart&rsquo;s stock delivered 9% on a total-return basis (price plus dividends). By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 lost 34% over the same period. It looks like WMT might be one of the best stocks to invest in this time around, too. Since the bull market peaked Feb. 19, Walmart&rsquo;s stock has posted a 3% gain versus a 4% decline for the index. Any signs of economic weakness should expand WMT&rsquo;s outperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500. There could be plenty more where that came from.</p>

<p>Dollar General</p>
<p>Market value: $46.8 billion</p>
<p>Dividend yield: 0.8%</p>
<p>Analysts&rsquo; opinion: 18 Strong Buy, 1 Buy, 8 Hold, 1 Sell, 0 Strong Sell</p>
<p>Just as it&rsquo;s a good sign Walmart is bringing on workers, the fact that Dollar General (DG, $186.00) is hiring 50,000 people by the end of April bodes well, too. Although many of the 50,000 jobs will be temporary, the discount retailer has added net new jobs of 35,000 over the past five years - an indication that some of the temporary workers might stay beyond the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As far back as August, investment professionals began to tout Dollar General as a stock to own during a recession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good news is consumers often shop more at the dollar stores during periods of economic weakness,&rdquo; Mark DeVaul, portfolio manager at the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund (HEIFX), stated in August 2019. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t expect a sharp increase in sales, but we suspect sales will remain stable at the dollar stores while other companies may feel greater pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Dollar General&rsquo;s latest fiscal year, 78% of its revenue was from consumables, which includes a large number of products that consumers are going to want to buy for less during a recession.</p>
<p>The idea that dollar stores might be some of the best stocks to invest in amid a recession isn&rsquo;t just a lazy assumption. Dollar General&rsquo;s biggest competitor, Dollar Tree (DLTR), delivered an almost 200% return between December 2008 and December 2011 - five times the performance of the S&amp;P 500. Dollar General didn&rsquo;t come public until November 2019, but its same-store sales improved by more than 9% in 2008 and 2009. It&rsquo;s abundantly clear these companies are tailor-made for tough economic times.</p>

<p>PepsiCo</p>
<p>Market value: $183.4 billion</p>
<p>Dividend yield: 2.9%</p>
<p>Analysts&rsquo; opinion: 10 Strong Buy, 1 Buy, 8 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong Sell</p>
<p>Consumer staples plays have been among the best stocks of this bear market. Though, when you think about the fact that consumers have been pulling back on sugary sodas for years, PepsiCo&rsquo;s (PEP, $132.21) doesn&rsquo;t feel like a clear-cut winner.</p>
<p>However, the company hasn&rsquo;t ignored the changing tastes of consumers. In addition to its legacy soft drinks, it also sells Gatorade, Lipton iced teas, Tropicana juices, Bubly sparkling water, Naked smoothies, Aquafina water and Starbucks (SBUX) bottled drinks via a partnership with the coffee giant. But really, Pepsi&rsquo;s strength is its Frito-Lay snacks division, which enjoys much higher margins than its beverages arm.</p>
<p>PepsiCo grew overall earnings by 3.9% on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis in fiscal 2019, and 4.5% on an organic basis, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency. A big driver of that growth was the company&rsquo;s Frito-Lay North America division, which grew revenues by 4.5%.</p>
<p>But where the snack-food business really contributed was its 5% increase in operating profit to $5.26 billion, or 51% of its total for the year. By comparison, PepsiCo Beverages North America had revenues that were 27% higher than Frito-Lay&rsquo;s, but operating profits that were 59% less. Without snacks, 2019 would have looked a lot different.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, Harvard Business Review covered how PepsiCo would deal with a recession:</p>
<p>&ldquo;PepsiCo&rsquo;s goal is to reinvigorate its carbonated soft drink category with substantially increased marketing investments in Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and other products. These investments include a new upbeat &lsquo;Optimism&rsquo; ad campaign, new packaging, and new point-of-purchase materials. PepsiCo also plans to increase activity in digital media specifically to target the youthful live-for-today segment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That could educate what Pepsi does in the months ahead. While a CEO&rsquo;s first instinct is to cut costs across the board, it&rsquo;s vital that PepsiCo ensure that Frito-Lay, its extremely profitable business, remains in the good graces of consumers. So investors might expect the company to pour significant resources into its snack business during this recession while finding places to cut costs elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hershey</p>
<p>Market value: $28.2 billion</p>
<p>Dividend yield: 2.3%</p>
<p>Analysts&rsquo; opinion: 1 Strong Buy, 0 Buy, 19 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong Sell</p>
<p>In a recession, there are guilty pleasures you can live without - 20-year-old Scotch, while wonderful, might need to wait when money&rsquo;s tight - and there are those you can&rsquo;t, like a good candy bar.</p>
<p>While Hershey (HSY, $135.67) might not be able to fully avoid taking a hit in a recession, it did a pretty good job in 2008. That year, Hershey reported sales of $5.13 billion, 3.8% higher than in 2007. Hershey produced a $311 million profit out of that, or 45.3% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most food companies in 2008 did well,&rdquo; Frost &amp; Sullivan analyst Christopher Shanahan said in March 2009. &ldquo;Hershey was definitely one of the leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, HSY shares lost 6%, including dividends, during the Great Recession. But it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 28 percentage points, and depending on when they entered, some investors actually squeezed gains out of Hershey.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Hershey increased its advertising in 2008, similar to what Pepsi did with its soft drinks. In times of difficulty, you have to stay front of mind with the consumer because if you don&rsquo;t, someone else will grab your customers. Equally important, HSY upped prices for its products, helping to offset higher input costs.</p>
<p>Should we go through an extended recession as a result of COVID-19, Hershey might bring out the same playbook. As a result, HSY might catch up from its current underperformance during this bear market.</p>

<p>Lockheed Martin</p>
<p>Market value: $116.2 billion</p>
<p>Dividend yield: 2.3%</p>
<p>Analysts&rsquo; opinion: 10 Strong Buy, 1 Buy, 10 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong Sell</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s (LMT, $414.30) 5% decline through the bear market so far isn&rsquo;t sterling - it&rsquo;s about on par with the broader market. But it&rsquo;s doing considerably better than its defense peers, as Boeing (BA) and a few others have led the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) down a gaudy 36.1%.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin is one of the better defensive plays in a recession because it generates a huge chunk of its sales from the Department of Defense, which is slated to spend $738 billion in 2020. Of that, approximately 90% goes to U.S. companies such as Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>During the Great Recession, while consumer spending declined 8.2%, defense spending increased by 12.2%. Further, between 1970 and 2009, out of six recessions, defense spending increased in all but one.</p>
<p>No one should be surprised to hear that LMT generates roughly 70% of its annual revenue from the U.S. government. In fact, Lockheed Martin accounts for 28% of the DoD&rsquo;s total spending. While many companies are laying off employees, Lockheed Martin has added 1,000 new employees during the coronavirus crisis, with an ongoing search to fill another 5,000 open positions.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, then, should be among the most recession-proof stocks to invest in.</p>
<p>One last note: Investors might be worried that in mid-March, the company announced CEO Marilyn Hewson, who has run the company since 2013, would be replaced June 15 by James Taiclet, who has helmed American Tower (AMT) since 2003. But you don&rsquo;t make a leadership change during this kind of crisis unless you&rsquo;re confident your business is able to weather the challenges ahead.</p>

<p>Analysts&rsquo; opinion: 11 Strong Buy, 0 Buy, 9 Hold, 2 Sell, 0 Strong Sell</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly Automotive (ORLY, $419.73) is one of the largest sellers of aftermarket automotive parts in the U.S. The company had 5,439 stores in the U.S. at the end of 2019, along with 21 stores in Mexico.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly has done a good job of balancing its revenues between DIY customers and professional shops; the business model has held ORLY in good stead for decades. Last year&rsquo;s revenues were split 55% to do-it-your customers and 45% to owners of automotive repair shops. During a recession, it&rsquo;s possible that sales to DIY customers will increase as people choose to save money by doing their own repairs.</p>
<p>In early March, before the coronavirus decimated stocks, investors bid up share prices of companies like O&rsquo;Reilly because of their natural resilience during recessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market is reading this as, no one will be buying new cars for a while,&rdquo; Kevin Tynan, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, told Bloomberg News. &ldquo;If consumers are retrenching, they will keep their cars longer. There is a natural resilience to these companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In October 2019, Kiplinger&rsquo;s Personal Finance Associate Editor Ryan Ermey discussed how the company survived the disruption that Amazon.com (AMZN) was expected to bring to the car-parts business when the e-commerce giant entered the fray in 2017. While ORLY sank on initial fears, it has more than doubled from its 2017 lows. And so far through the current bear market, O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s stock has actually gained 7%.</p>
<p>ORLY should hold its own and earn its place among stocks to invest in during this recession.</p>

<p>The latest data from Nielsen suggests that online liquor sales during the coronavirus are booming. During the week ended March 21, alcohol sales were up 55% compared to the same period a year earlier. Even more impressive, online liquor sales were up 243%. They cooled off a little for the week ended March 28, with overall sales up 22%. However, online liquor sales grew by 291% year-over-year.</p>
<p>But ultimately, alcohol distributors need the volume business from restaurants and bars to get by, and we&rsquo;ve seen signs of that as the economy has begun to reopen. Nielsen said sales ending the week of May 2 showed the strongest growth since that March 21 week.</p>
<p>Diageo (DEO, $147.82), the world&rsquo;s largest maker of branded premium spirits, saw an encouraging trend in March 2009. Its U.S. business improved despite the country being in the midst of a recession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see growth continuing even in this difficult environment and expect industry growth staying in the range of 0-1 percent for sales volumes,&rdquo; Ivan Menezes, Diageo&rsquo;s head of its North American operations and current CEO, told Reuters in 2009. &ldquo;The consumer shift is toward strong brands with strong credentials and strong heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diageo - whose brands include Johnnie Walker, Crown Royal, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan and Guinness - has performed largely in line with the market during the downturn. But if liquor sales continue to firm up, Diageo&rsquo;s stock should pull away.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of &ldquo;sin stocks,&rdquo; Philip Morris International (PM, $77.70) did just fine during the Great Recession. In fact, that&rsquo;s when its stock started trading: Altria (MO) spun off its international business on March 27, 2008. Shareholders got one new share of PM for every share of MO they owned. Philip Morris&rsquo; shares traded roughly flat between then and the end of the bear market, versus a 20%-plus loss for the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Philip Morris - and most other major cigarette companies, for that matter - benefited from increased sales during the Great Recession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sales records of these tobacco companies demonstrate that smokers not only continued to smoke but also actually increased their cigarette intake during this period of economic difficulty, despite the harm to everyone caused by exposure to this habit,&rdquo; Teikyo University School of Medicine professors Peisen He and Eiji Yano wrote in their June 2009 article, &ldquo;Tobacco companies are booming despite an economic depression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several factors have changed since then, of course. The world&rsquo;s attitudes toward smoking have changed considerably over the past decade. Not to mention, the coronavirus&rsquo;s effect on respiratory systems might make even diehard smokers a little wary at this time.</p>
<p>But Philip Morris has been working to counter the anti-smoking trend by replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products, such as its IQOS electronic device that heats tobacco instead of burning it. PM also claims IQOS reduces the levels of harmful chemicals ingested compared to cigarettes. The company says roughly 9.7 million people &ldquo;have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2019, its heated tobacco shipment volume increased 44% over the previous year to 59.7 billion units. By 2021, it expects to reach its goal of 90 billion to 100 billion units. Philip Morris will see some short-term pain from COVID-19, mostly related to weak sales to travelers, that already appears to be priced in. But the company&rsquo;s pivot away from cigarettes should pay dividends in good times and bad.</p>

<p>A study by Princeton researchers suggested that during the Great Recession, women between the ages of 20 and 24 had at least half a million fewer babies than they otherwise would have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we so much less likely to reproduce when jobs are scarce? Money, mostly,&rdquo; The Atlantic&rsquo;s Olga Khazan wrote in September 2014. &ldquo;Derek Thompson has previously written how the recession was like a big pause button on the lives of Millennials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It costs a quarter of a million dollars to raise a child, so laid-off couples might have been extra-scrupulous with their birth control between 2008 and 2011.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It just so happens that household and personal products company Church &amp; Dwight (CHD, $74.75) makes Trojan condoms, the leading condom manufacturer in the U.S. with about 70% market share.</p>
<p>However, Trojan isn&rsquo;t Church &amp; Dwight&rsquo;s only power brand. It has 11 other major brands that capture significant market share in their respective categories and collectively generate 80% of the company&rsquo;s overall revenues. They include Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda, OxyClean laundry stain remover, First Response pregnancy tests, Orajel oral care, Waterpik power flossers, and Spinbrush power toothbrushes.</p>
<p>Church &amp; Dwight actually improved its earnings per share between 2007 and 2009 by consumers with value pricing at a time when they could really use a break. In good times and bad, people always like a good deal. CHD is hardly cheap at almost 4 times sales, but it&rsquo;s a consistent performer, and that makes it one of the best stocks to invest in during a recession.</p>

<p>Like many consumer staples companies in a recession, General Mills (GIS, $62.14) tends to benefit from people not going out as much to eat. General Mills - which is responsible for numerous big brands including Cheerios, Pillsbury, Totino&rsquo;s, Betty Crocker, Yoplait and Annie&rsquo;s Homegrown - did just fine during the Great Recession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re continuing to see strong consumer demand for our products in markets around the world,&rdquo; former CEO Ken Powell said in the company&rsquo;s fiscal Q2 2009 release, issued in December 2008. &ldquo;Our segment operating profit margin held steady despite higher input costs and the strong double-digit increase in consumer marketing to support our brands. Performance through the first half of 2009 has us solidly on track to deliver strong sales and earnings growth for the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, Powell raised the company&rsquo;s earnings guidance for 2009 by 4 cents per share to $3.87. It finished fiscal 2009 with $3.98 in EPS, 11 cents higher than its guidance for the year.</p>
<p>Now, as we&rsquo;ve entered another recession, current CEO Jeff Harmening is quite optimistic about its chances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long since we had a recession and especially here in the U.S. But certainly, during that time, people tend to eat in more, and General Mills did quite well,&rdquo; Harmening said during the company&rsquo;s March earnings call. &ldquo;But that was a decade ago. We&rsquo;ll see how it plays out this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of increased demand for its cereals, frozen products and pet foods during the coronavirus, General Mills expects its 2020 EPS to increase by 6% to 8% in the current fiscal year - much higher than its previous projection of 3% to 5%.</p>

<p>Unilever (UL, $56.53) reported its fiscal 2019 results at the end of January. The global consumer staples company - whose brands include Dove soap, Hellmann&rsquo;s condiments, Axe personal care products and Breyers ice cream - grew revenues by 2.9%. The Home Care operating segment, which includes brands such as Cif and Sun, led that growth with a 6.1% bump in sales. Free cash flow swelled by 13% to 6.1 billion euros.</p>
<p>Unilever has focused on global brands it believes can be juiced for even more sales. As a result, it has undertaken a strategic review of its tea business, which could be sold in 2020.</p>
<p>Paul Polman, who was CEO of Unilever during the Great Recession, found the company&rsquo;s business ideally suited to fight off a recession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumers postpone buying cars, televisions and that frees up a lot of money to spend on everyday needs. We don&rsquo;t see personal care or food markets go down substantially,&rdquo; Polman said in March 2009.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2010, Unilever&rsquo;s sales grew from 22.1 billion euros to 23.58 billion euros, though operating profits did fall by 13.5% over that time. Still, as long as the recession persists, that should weigh on consumer discretionary spending. Some of that should be redirected to Unilever&rsquo;s products.</p>
<p>Clorox</p>

<p>Analysts&rsquo; opinion: 3 Strong Buy, 0 Buy, 7 Hold, 0 Sell, 5 Strong Sell</p>
<p>Clorox (CLX, $198.76) has been among the best stocks to ride out the coronavirus outbreak, would have to be it. The company has produced a 21% total return since Feb. 19 while the index is off 4% once you include dividends. Pardon the pun, but it&rsquo;s wiping the floor with most other U.S.-listed stocks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not surprising given that Clorox&rsquo;s disinfectant wipes and bleach have been flying off the shelves. The company controls approximately 50% of the market for disinfectant wipes. In times of crisis, consumers tend to stick with brand names they know, opting to pass on cheaper, store brands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on conversations with retail buyers, we estimate COVID-19 related demand could boost baseline disinfectant category trends by 3-5x in the next few months as retailers work to rebuild inventory and stay in stock,&rdquo; UBS analyst Steven Strycula wrote in mid-March.</p>
<p>Further, according to Deutsche Bank data going back to the 1990s, consumer staples stocks such as Clorox tend to outperform the S&amp;P 500 in recessions and other difficult periods.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2009, Clorox&rsquo;s earnings expanded by 24%. The company also treated income investors to a 35% bump in its annual dividend payments (distributed quarterly) over that time. It has since extended that streak to 42 consecutive years, including a 10% raise last year, putting it among the Dividend Aristocrats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rewarding our stockholders has always been a priority,&rdquo; CEO Benno Dorer said in a May 2019 press release. &ldquo;This double-digit increase in our dividend is on top of last year&rsquo;s 14% increase. It represents an ongoing effort to put our strong cash flow generation to work, which emphasizes investing in long-term business growth and returning excess cash to our stockholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Investors got increase No. 43 in May of this year - a 5% hike to $1.11 per share.</p>

<p>If you look through fellow Aristocrat Procter &amp; Gamble&rsquo;s (PG, $119.05) brand directory, you&rsquo;ll see that many of its products aren&rsquo;t going to lose sales momentum during a recession. They&rsquo;re products we use every day: Oral B toothbrushes, Ivory soap, Crest toothpaste, Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>P&amp;G pointed out in a February presentation that during the first half of its 2020 fiscal year, all eight of its operating segments posted positive organic sales growth. Its Skin &amp; Personal Care and Personal Health Care businesses led the charge with 13% and 11% growth, respectively. Those include brands such as Gillette, Ivory, Pepto Bismol and Vicks.</p>
<p>In the first half of fiscal 2020, Procter &amp; Gamble expected organic sales growth of 3% to 4% and core earnings per share growth of 4% to 8%. It delivered 6% and 18% growth, respectively, far in excess of its projections.</p>
<p>As people stay home during the coronavirus, when they do go out to the grocery store and pharmacy, you can be sure they&rsquo;ll buy numerous P&amp;G products. And the company in general is in a good position, according to P&amp;G CFO Jon Moeller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are better positioned for several reasons to deal with (an economic) downturn than we were in 2007,&rdquo; Moeller told CNBC in October. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use tools like value messaging, pack sizes, performance messaging to ensure that if there is a downturn, we are in the best position for a consumer in a pinch. &hellip; We don&rsquo;t see consumers stopping laundry or shampooing or conditioning or feminine protection during a recession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble further instilled confidence by stating in mid-April that it would hike its dividend for the 64th consecutive year, doling out a 6% increase. At a time when some companies are announcing dividend cuts or suspensions, you can count on P&amp;G&rsquo;s 2.6% yield.</p>

<p>In these difficult times, it&rsquo;s good to see companies stepping up for their employees.</p>
<p>Hormel (HRL, $48.11) announced in late March that it would pay out more than $4 million in special cash bonuses to all full- and part-time workers that man the production lines at its various plants, ensuring that Americans don&rsquo;t go hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a global branded food company, we play a critical role in providing safe, high-quality food during this unprecedented time,&rdquo; CEO Jim Snee said. &ldquo;Our incredible team of more than 13,000 plant professionals is the backbone of our company and this special bonus is one way we can continue to thank them for how they have risen to the challenge and continue to produce food with a sense of purpose and pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of the bonus program, in which each full-time worker gets a $300 bonus and every part-time worker gets $150, also has extended paid sick leave for any employees who can&rsquo;t make it to work as a result of the virus.</p>
<p>During the Great Recession, Hormel&rsquo;s results were mixed, as consumers balked at some of its more upscale products.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are seeing some ups and downs in terms of demand for our products - very strong demand for the canned side of the franchise, Spam luncheon meat, Hormel chili, Dinty Moore beef stew,&rdquo; former Hormel CEO Jeffrey Ettinger said in March 2009.</p>
<p>In February, before the coronavirus took hold, Hormel&rsquo;s guidance for fiscal 2020 were net sales of at least $9.5 billion and EPS of $1.69. Refrigerated Products, its Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products (such as Spam) were expected to lead the way.</p>
<p>Hormel is one of the best stocks to invest in during a recession simply because it shouldn&rsquo;t get slaughtered. It&rsquo;s currently sitting on a sub-1% loss since the market peak to beat the index by about 4 percentage points.</p>

<p>During the last recession, analysts worried about how many members Costco (COST, $307.19) would be able to retain. It did better than expected. In 2007, Costco boasted 27,500 total primary cardholders. Two years later, Costco finished fiscal 2009 with 30,600 primary cardholders - an 11.3% gain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were expectations that people would be willing to let their memberships expire, but the numbers have held up quite well,&rdquo; Morningstar retail analyst R.J. Hottovy said in January 2010.</p>
<p>As America makes its way through the coronavirus recession, Costco remains one of the better-positioned retailers during and after the crisis. In the five weeks ended April 5, Costco saw its same-store sales increase a whopping 12.3%. Analysts actually expected them to be as high as 24.1% as members hoarded everything from toilet paper to orange juice. However, it seems that once the social distancing rules kicked in for much of the country in mid-March, traffic to its stores slowed. Despite this, Costco&rsquo;s foot traffic for all of March increased by 5.3%.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s going to help Costco as the recession wears on wasn&rsquo;t even a big contributor back in the Great Recession: online sales.</p>
<p>In the company&rsquo;s third quarter ended May 10, Costco&rsquo;s online sales increased by 66.1% over the same period a year earlier. Total comparable-store sales improved by 7.8%, and profits of $1.89 per share beat expectations for $1.85 per share.</p>

<p>Business has been booming at Kroger (KR, $33.01), the nation&rsquo;s largest grocery store chain with more than 460,000 workers, thanks to its role as an &ldquo;essential&rdquo; business and a food provider. The company says its same-store sales jumped 30% year-over-year in March, spiking in the middle of the month because of customer hoarding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demand has been broad based across grocery and fresh departments,&rdquo; Kroger said in a release. &ldquo;It is too early to speculate what will emerge as the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; in food consumption at home or what the impact on sales will be in future periods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kroger now expects its first-quarter same-store sales (typically revenues generated at stores open longer than 12 months) to be higher than originally expected.</p>
<p>In the Great Recession, Kroger reported healthy earnings as a result of changes in customer routines such as eating out less, entertaining at home and buying more private-label store-branded items. Equally important, Kroger did well against the mighty Walmart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 33 markets where the Supercenters have a third-place market share in the grocery sector, and Kroger is either number one or two, Kroger&rsquo;s share of grocery sales in those areas rose 8.6 percent year over year during the fourth-quarter period,&rdquo; CBS reported on March 12, 2009.</p>
<p>If the last recession is any indication, Kroger will benefit. So far, it&rsquo;s sprinting past the market with a 12% gain since Feb. 19.</p>

<p>Every business that lives through a recession tends to survive through innovation and moxie. In the case of McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD, $202.65), which is so big that it likely doesn&rsquo;t fear much, we&rsquo;re likely to see a few new tricks out of a company that has always been well ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s opened almost 600 stores in 2008. Further, its 2008 sales were higher than both 2006 and 2007. Between December 2007 and June 2009, MCD stock delivered a total return of 2.5%, considerably higher than the 35% loss in the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Americans traded down in the last recession. McDonald&rsquo;s was ideally positioned to benefit from this trend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a recession, people eat out less and at home more frequently. And when they eat out, they eat at cheaper places,&rdquo; Slate contributor Daniel Gross wrote in August 2009. &ldquo;McDonald&rsquo;s is so cheap, efficient, pervasive and convenient that it was a viable alternative to casual restaurants like Ruby Tuesday and to cooking at home. Investors, like diners, angled toward McDonald&rsquo;s and away from Ruby Tuesday during the recession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As this current recession continues, analysts believe defensive plays like McDonald&rsquo;s make sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe MCD is well-positioned to perform strongly on a relative basis in this scenario (recession) when considering global comps for McDonald&rsquo;s during 2008-2009 were a recession-resilient +5.4% (best-performing brand in our coverage universe),&rdquo; Baird Equity Research analysts wrote in an April note to clients.</p>

<p>Kiplinger listed Rollins (ROL, $44.57) as one of 15 recession-resistant stocks to own in October. So far, so good. The stock is actually up 12% since the start of the bear market, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by roughly 16 percentage points.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, Rollins grew its various pest control businesses, including the Orkin brand, by a healthy 3%. In good times and bad, individuals and businesses will pay for pest removal.</p>
<p>Rollins rolled into 2020 with momentum. Its 2019 sales grew by 10.6% to $2.02 billion, and it increased its dividend or the 18th consecutive year. Then in late March, Rollins announced that it was launching Orkin VitalClean, which provides customers with a disinfectant for suppressing a wide range of germs including those that cause the coronavirus, swine flu and avian flu. It&rsquo;s especially useful for removing bacteria and viruses from hard, non-porous surfaces such as stainless steel.</p>
<p>This service could be a hit with consumers in the current environment.</p>
<p>As for Rollins&rsquo; growth strategy: It&rsquo;s a combination of organic revenue growth from its 2.4 million residential and commercial customers along with acquisitions of other pest control businesses in the U.S. and around the world. As the coronavirus hurts other businesses in the industry, it&rsquo;s likely that Rollins will be open to further acquisitions.</p>
<p>Rollins had plenty of liquidity to get it through the recession. Nonetheless, the company reduced its dividend from 12 cents per share to 8 cents for the most recent quarter in the face of pandemic-related uncertainties. That said, Senior Vice President and CFO Eddie Northen said at the time, &ldquo;This is a proactive move that is consistent with our Company&rsquo;s conservative balance sheet approach. We plan to return to our past dividend performance as soon as practical.&rdquo; The stock&rsquo;s quick recovery suggests that dividend reduction will be short-lived.</p>
<p>One last wild card that puts Rollins among the best stocks to invest in during this recession? The Rollins family owns 53.2% of the company&rsquo;s shares. Family-controlled businesses tend to believe in long-term planning, and that bodes well for survivability.</p>

<p>So many people have succumbed to COVID-19 in 2020, it&rsquo;s hard not to think of funerals and the death care industry. The thousands of people who&rsquo;ve died from the virus have either made pre-death funeral arrangements or their loved ones are making them. In New York City, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., funeral homes are overwhelmed by the number of clients they&rsquo;re seeing as a result of this crisis.</p>
<p>Service Corporation International (SCI, $42.20), an owner of more than 1,900 funeral homes and cemeteries in 44 states and eight Canadian provinces, ought to have momentum as it attempts to navigate the recession.</p>
<p>In June 2019, as recession talk was heating up, Bank of America analyst Joanna Gajuk suggested that companies like Service Corp only suffered a &ldquo;slight pullback&rdquo; in their business during the Great Recession. The reasoning? Roughly 75% of funeral home clients who pay for funeral arrangements ahead of time pay a lump sum. In addition, 40% to 50% pay ahead of time for cemetery plots, also in one lump sum.</p>
<p>In 2019, Service Corp finished the year with free cash flow of $390 million and a free cash flow margin of 12.1%. It expects to grow sales by 8% to 12% in 2020, filtering down to earnings of $1.96 to $2.16 a share.</p>
<p>SCI shares are among the few recession stocks on this list that are underperforming the index during this downturn. It&rsquo;s too early to know how the coronavirus will affect Service Corp&rsquo;s business, but the three analysts that have sounded off recently still consider SCI a buy. Moreover, CFO Eric Tanzberger said in a release that &ldquo;Our financial position is strong with very robust liquidity. We continue to expect a significant amount of positive operating cash flow during 2020.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every year, the other 40% of Americans put themselves through the annual ritual of preparing their own taxes. In 2020, as the pandemic rages, those that have traditionally done their own taxes could decide to hand over their return to a professional to lessen the anxiety of self-preparation.</p>
<p>One service H&amp;R Block provides that should benefit from the coronavirus is Tax Pro Go, which allows clients to upload their documents using their smartphone. The H&amp;R Block tax pro does the rest. And if you still want to prepare your own return, HRB offers the online tools to help you do that.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block&rsquo;s results will be spread out more than usual this year, however. The IRS has extended this year&rsquo;s federal filing deadline to July 15, and most states have followed suit. But they still want to hear from taxpayers eventually.</p>
<p>HRB lost about 14 percentage points less than the S&amp;P 500 during the Great Recession, and in a choppy fashion that allowed many investors to exit with gains. In H&amp;R Block&rsquo;s 2009 fiscal year ended April 30, 2009, the company&rsquo;s sales were flat at $4.08 billion, while its operating income actually increased by 15% to $513.06 million.</p>
<p>What will happen during this recession is very much up in the air. What we do know is that H&amp;R Block&rsquo;s strongest quarter of the year in 2020 won&rsquo;t look how it normally does, as Americans spread out their filing duties into the summer.</p>

Coronavirus and its impact on football - A Sports Law and Policy Centre and LawInSport Joint Survey - Version 3</p>
<p>Published 07 June 2020</p>
<p>Version 3.0 (7 June 2020)</p>
<p>This independent and open-source initiative is based on a series of questions sent to leading international sports lawyers and academics from 52 countries worldwide . The aim is to provide an overview of the measures adopted at national leve against the Coronavirus pandemic by:</p>
<p>governments national football associations leagues, (iv) clubs, and player associations.</p>
<p>Map highlighting countries analysed in this survey, in light blue</p>
<p>This survey contains an Executive Summary and National Reports based on a questionnaire on the most important issues concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on football.</p>
<p>It is divided into the following sections[1]:</p>
<p>The “Big Five” Leagues ( England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) Other European federations (Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine) Americas (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay and USA) Africa (Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa) Asia and Oceania (Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE)</p>
<p>This version of the survey (V.3) also includes a snapshot of the status of professional football championships in each of these 52 jurisdictions. It is up to date to 5 June 2020[2] [3], and will be regularly updated, as the situation continues to develop.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we sincerely thank our colleagues and co-authors who have invested their precious time in researching and writing the national reports; valuable contributions which make this survey unique.</p>

<p>Executive Summary</p>
<p>A comparative analysis of the measures adopted in 52 jurisdictions around the world to counter the effects of COVID-19 on the football industry.</p>
<p>By Michele Colucci[4], Alessandro Coni[5], Sean Cottrell[6], Durante Rapacciuolo[7], and Rustam Sethna[8]</p>
<p>On 7 April 2020, FIFA issued guidelines (“COVID-19 Football Regulatory Issues[9]”) to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the football industry and to ensure as far as possible, harmony in measures taken by member associations. These guidelines were formulated after several consultations between members from the FIFA administration, the six confederations, member associations, the European Club Association, FIFPro (the world player’s union) and the World Leagues Forum.</p>
<p>However, as highlighted by FIFA, the guidelines remain subject to the domestic laws of each of its 211-member associations. Therefore, while the global football community is certainly united in its effort to minimize the impact of the pandemic, the measures adopted by each member association, league, and club are bound to differ, considering the circumstances and laws prevalent in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is worth highlighting that while FIFA have declared COVID-19 (and its resultant consequences on the football industry) as a ‘force majeure’ event, the impact of this is limited to the measures adopted by FIFA to make changes/provide special dispensation from its regulatory regime (for example, by allowing federations to change transfer windows). The principles of ‘force majeure’ will only be applicable in the context of player contracts insofar as they are recognised by and consistent with applicable national laws, and do not, by default override the applicability of domestic law, even if contrary to FIFA’s position.</p>
<p>Significantly, at the time of writing, it is understood that FIFA, in co-operation with stakeholders of international football, is seeking to address frequently asked questions as well as clarify its position on certain regulatory and legal issues arising out of the April 2020 guidelines. This is expected to be published by FIFA imminently.</p>
<p>The aim of this survey is to offer an independent review of the developments, to identify best practices and solutions to face the current crisis, and above all, to take this experience as an opportunity to “rethink football” and make it more sustainable.</p>
<p>Since the publication of version 2 on 5 May 2020, we have seen a shift in focus, among most of the international football community, towards returning to play. Indeed, there appears to be a direct co-relation between return to play and mitigation of the financial impact on the industry. However, as with all realms of society, approaches have varied among jurisdictions, with the aim to strike a delicate balance between public health and financial rejuvenation.</p>
<p>For ease of reference, we have highlighted notable efforts taken by governments, leagues, federations and others in:</p>
<p>the “big five” federations; and,</p>
<p>47 other nations, comprising (20 other UEFA confederations, 10 countries from the Americas (North and South America), 6 from Africa and 11 from Asia).</p>
<p>This executive summary provides a general overview of the main themes, trends and observations set out in the survey below. The survey intentionally focuses on central themes and therefore we do not address every scenario by jurisdiction in this executive summary, due the volume of permutations that can occur in each case.</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-commencement of Football</li>
</ol>
<p>Germany was the first of the ‘Big 5’ nations to restart football, with the Bundesliga returning to action on 16 May 2020.</p>
<p>The Premier League in England, will now resume on 17 June 2020, with the Serie A in Italy and La Liga in Spain set to resume on 20 and 8 June respectively, after each of these countries adopted specific measures/protocols for the return to training and competition.</p>
<p>France remains the only ‘Big 5’ nation to have definitively cancelled their 2019-20 season, with the Ligue 1 title awarded to Paris Saint-Germain. Legal action by clubs who were relegated and those that missed out on European places, has been commenced.</p>
<p>In addition to France, it appears that the federations from Argentina, Belgium, Cameroon, Cyprus, Kenya, Mexico, The Netherlands, and Scotland have put an end to their respective division championships.</p>
<p>In the USA, the MLS and NWSL have agreed with their respective players’ unions - after long and heated negotiations - to hold tournaments this summer behind closed doors (in Disney and in Utah, respectively), with a new collective bargaining agreement reached between the MLS and the players, with the details about the MLS tournament (including the start date) to be released soon.</p>
<p>While generally, all resumed/to be resumed football will be played behind closed doors, league matches in Russia, which resume on 19 June 2020, will be played with spectators, at 10% stadium capacity. Spectators are required to wear masks and gloves. Similarly, in Poland, spectators will be allowed to return to stadiums (also from 19 June 2020) at 25% capacity.</p>
<p>In Serbia, as of 1 June 2020, gatherings of up to 1,000 people have been permitted, however football matches are an exception, allowing more people than that to attend matches in stadia, provided that social distancing norms are followed.</p>
<p>(For more information on the status of each of the 52 professional first division leagues, please refer to our ‘Return to Play Snapshot’).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Government Measures</li>
</ol>
<p>In England, pursuant to the government’s ‘Job Retention Scheme’ football clubs can ‘furlough’ employees and apply for a grant from the government that covers 80% of their usual monthly wage costs, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. Similar government schemes have also been implemented in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Notably, in Italy, football clubs can avail of (maximum) 6-year credit facilities guaranteed by SACE, Italy’s Export Credit Agency, up until 31 December 2020. This SACE guarantee covers 90% of the principal amount for clubs with annual revenues lower than €1.5 billion provided that funds from these facilities are applied towards personnel costs, investments and working capital of football clubs[10].</p>
<p>Outside the ‘Big 5’, certain national authorities have adopted special temporary employment allowances/benefits, for all employees (thereby including football players) up to certain amounts. In particular, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Paraguay and Uruguay are a few countries to have announced employment related benefits.</p>
<p>Other countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and USA have granted indirect benefits to businesses in the form of tax breaks and/or loan assistance, by way of example.</p>
<p>Generally, national governments have not adopted specific financial measures for the football sector, however the New Zealand Government’s NZ$25 million ‘community resilience fund’ for sports federations is of particular note.</p>
<p>Further, in an interesting move, the Ministry of Culture in Norway has promised to compensate clubs for any shortfall in income.</p>
<p>In Indonesia the government has implemented a program applicable to unemployed Indonesian citizens aged 18 and over and currently not attending formal education, which incentivises the population to ‘upskill’ by subscribing to various workshop and courses. The idea is to boost competence, productivity and competitiveness in the labour market going forward.</p>
<p>Federation Measures:</p>
<p>The Premier League in England has advanced £125 million to the English Football League (i.e. divisions 2-4) (“EFL”) and National League (divisions 5 and below). The EFL has also set up a £50m relief fund for its clubs.</p>
<p>In Germany, the league (“DFL”) has lent its support to the regional and local soccer associations with 1.5 Million Euro allocated to each[11]. The “DFB-Bundestag” established a Task Force “Financial Stability for the Third Division”, intending to promote greater financial stability in the third division for the future[12].</p>
<p>The Italian football association (“FIGC”), has notified a suspension/relaxation of certain deadlines regarding the fulfilment of financial obligations to comply with the competition licencing system (with plans to redraft the licensing system in its current form). On 4 June 2020, FIGC also announced a special fund “Salva Calcio” (Save Football) of €21 million, which will benefit professional clubs (and their staff) from the second, third, amateur and women’s divisions.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that federations from Japan, The Netherlands, and Portugal are among a handful of those who have created and can rely on special funds to face emergencies such as the one at hand. In particular, the J-League (Japan) has announced emergency funding in the form of uncollateralised loans for its clubs. Slovenian and Polish federations have also adopted financial packages to assist their clubs, while the GFA in Ghana has promised financial support to clubs too.</p>
<p>Examples of other assistance by federations include funding for COVID-19 testing (Azerbaijan), relaxation for non-COVID-19 related payment deadlines until August 2020 (Greece) and financial support for coaches and players in Cameroon.</p>
<p>Employment Status of Players:</p>
<p>Players in the ‘Big 5’ countries are all considered to be ‘employees’ and sign ‘employment contracts’ for employment law purposes. This means that they are allowed to benefit from any government-related employment benefit programs (whether they have done, or indeed should, particularly the top division players, has been a topic of debate since the suspension of competition).</p>
<p>The situation outside the ‘Big 5’, is not as clear. In Croatia, Romania, Japan and India football players are classified as being ‘self-employed’, or ‘service providers’ rather than ‘employees’. As such they are unable to benefit from the measures in place to protect employees/workers. Players in other jurisdictions that classify footballers as ‘self-employed’ as opposed to being ‘employees’ are likely to be similarly affected. However, it is worth noting that the Romanian government has decided to treat players as if they are employees for the purposes of benefits, during the lockdown period.</p>
<p>Interestingly in Azerbaijan, it appears that players are allowed to choose whether to structure their agreements as ‘service agreements’ or ‘employment agreements’.</p>
<p>In the USA, MLS clubs do not hire players directly; instead, all player contracts are centrally owned by the league and then allocated to MLS clubs. The players are thus technically employees of MLS and, as such, are paid by the league, not the clubs.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Rights and Revenue:</p>
<p>The cancellation of live sport across the world has resulted in a significant reduction of content for broadcasters, who faced unexpected gaps in their schedules resulting in a decrease in advertisement revenue and customer subscriptions.</p>
<p>Upon the cancellation of competition in France, the league (“LFP”) entered into a settlement agreement with broadcasters, who agreed to pay a fraction of the instalments falling due before competition was suspended. On 4 May 2020, the league in France adopted a resolution that would enable them to take out a state-guaranteed loan (of approx. €224.5 million) to make up for the shortfall in broadcast rights monies caused by the termination of the 2019-20 season[13].</p>
<p>In Germany, the DFL reached an agreement with its broadcast partners for the payment of fees in tranches, partly payable upfront and partly, as and when competition resumes, in return for a marginal reduction of consideration. One broadcaster (Discovery) is seeking to terminate the agreement. This has not affected the availability of matches on TV when the championship has resumed, with DFL having reached an agreement with the other broadcasters (Amazon, DAZN) for the transmission of the matches during the remainder of the season[14].</p>
<p>In Spain, broadcasters look set to fulfill their contractual obligations, given the imminent return to play.</p>
<p>With 92 Premier League matches to play in England, 29 will be free to watch. It has also been reported that there are ongoing negotiations regarding a potential £330m rebate from clubs to broadcasters. At the time of writing, the latest reports suggest that the Premier League and Sky have agreed to defer a portion of that rebate (up to £170m) until the 2021/22 season[15].</p>
<p>In Italy, broadcast payments have been suspended until the Serie A (and B) resumes, however, broadcasters are pushing for payment deferrals or rights fee reductions as a consequence of the suspension of competition.</p>
<p>Broadly, the effect of broadcast revenue on countries outside the ‘Big 5’ can be categorised into the following three ‘buckets’:</p>
<p>where the broadcaster has paid/is continuing to pay its instalments (see for example: Argentina , Chile , China , Croatia , Ecuador , The Netherlands , Paraguay , Poland , Russia , Serbia , Slovenia , Switzerland ).</p>
<p>, , , , , , , , , , , ). where broadcasters have halted/suspended their payments as long as football remains suspended ( Denmark , Turkey , Colombia , Uruguay , Ghana , Saudi Arabia and UAE ).</p>
<p>, , , , , and ). iii. where broadcasters have already reached a deal/solution on the way forward, such as Scotland.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in some countries (e.g. Greece), media rights are sold individually by each club.</p>
<p>Other trends worth noting are:</p>
<p>governments requiring that matches (when resumed) be broadcasted for free ( Argentina );</p>
<p>); the broadcast of alternative, esports football competitions as in Colombia and other content such as podcasts and vlogs in the Philippines ; and</p>
<p>and other content such as podcasts and vlogs in the ; and iii. in return for a consideration reduction/refund for the 2019-20 season, broadcasters are providing clubs with the ability to live stream their matches for free for the 2020-21 season, providing fans (mainly season ticket holders) with the ability to watch games, likely to be held behind closed doors, at no extra cost (as in Scotland ).</p>
<p>). Sponsorship: There is a risk that sponsorship deals might not be as lucrative going forward, with sponsors likely to reduce their spending/budgets due to their own financial hardships. This in turn is likely to impact the ability of clubs to sign new sponsorship deals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given that the remainder of the season and (potentially) part of the following season will be played behind closed doors, most of the advertising investments focused in stadia - particularly in lower leagues where television coverage is limited – is likely to be reconsidered or withdrawn.</p>
<p>Particularly, it appears that teams in the lower divisions would be most impacted by sponsors re-negotiating, suspending and even terminating their agreements with clubs (see: Germany).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the lack of official matches and public activity by clubs is likely to diminish the exposure granted to sponsors, and a willingness by the sponsors to cooperate with clubs in the current situation, based on the information gathered in this survey, it is expected that the greatest impact will be sustained in the coming season(s).</p>
<p>In some countries (Croatia, Cyprus, Slovenia, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana) sponsors have already asked for a rebate and/or halted their payments.</p>
<p>Player Associations/Collective Bargaining</p>
<p>Football trade unions – with varying degrees of success and involvement – have been engaged in collective bargaining/negotiations with clubs to facilitate an agreement with respect to the payment, reduction or a suspension of player salaries.</p>
<p>In the ‘Big 5’ nations, trade unions/player associations have been negotiating with clubs on behalf of the players. For example, the player’s union in England has a system of providing hardship loans to players in need. The player’s union in France reached an agreement ‘in-principle’ with clubs for the reduction of wages by 30%, although this is unlikely to be binding at an individual level.</p>
<p>Collective bargaining in the Scandinavian countries – Denmark, Norway, Sweden – is more prominent when compared with (for e.g.) Switzerland, South Africa, Mexico and China.</p>
<p>Most known for their collective bargaining process however, is the USA (across all major sports). In MLS, clubs do not negotiate individually, making collective bargaining agreements of key importance. A new CBA had been agreed in principle for the next four-year period, prior to the suspension of football. This was then renegotiated to factor in current circumstances.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, as with the cases of Canada and India, is that despite the existence of established (and FIFPro recognised) player unions, the leagues/federations are currently to engaged with the unions, who are therefore unable to occupy a more central role in the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p>Collective bargaining aside, clubs and players across the world have been and continue to engage in negotiations, in their individual capacities, with a handful of clubs having reached agreements in certain jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The terms of such settlements vary on a case by case basis. However, the quantum of payment deferred or reduced (as the case may be) is linked to the income each player receives – the higher the income, the greater the salary deferral/reduction, as applicable. This is a general principle followed across the board.</p>
<p>In the ‘Big 5’ countries, there have been instances of clubs arriving at agreements with their players for the reduction of their salaries. Examples include, Athletic Bilbao in Spain, AS Roma and Juventus in Italy, Arsenal and Aston Villa in England and Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund in Germany.</p>
<p>Notably, Germany’s four UEFA Champions League clubs have also jointly decided to contribute €20 million to clubs lower down the German football pyramid, while a group of Premier League players in England have donated funds to the National Health Service through a combined initiative named ‘Players Together’.</p>
<p>For example, all 28 players of Japanese club, Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo have agreed to return a portion of their salaries to the club in order to help the management face the crisis and the operational costs involved.</p>
<p>In China, the CFA issued a formal proposal[16] calling for professional football clubs to reasonably adjust salaries applicable to players and coaches of men’s teams. The proposal seems to be China’s localised response to the FIFA Guidelines on COVID – 19 Football Regulatory Issues, in which the CFA encouraged clubs to conduct amicable negotiation with players and coaches either on collective or individual basis</p>
<p>In Australia, 7 of the 11 clubs in the Hyundai A-League, who are less financially robust, have stood down their players and staff with no further payment. The remaining 4, better resourced clubs continue to meet their obligations to players. Staff at some Australian clubs appear to have taken paid leave in order to cushion the financial impact upon their employers.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, all clubs, acting in concert with the Saudi Pro League, have decided to cut coach and player salaries to the extent of 50%, in Canada, the Canadian Premier League has directed all clubs to cut player salaries by 25%, while in Malaysia, following the breakdown of collective negotiations, the federation imposed a tiered reduction of salary of 10%, 15%, 20% or 30%, depending on the income of each player.</p>
<p>Return to play (rights and obligations of players and clubs)</p>
<p>With the focus shifting away from ‘if’ football will resume to ‘when’, an issue of topical importance is that of player rights and the club’s duty of care with respect to their return to play policies.</p>
<p>To this end, the World Player’s Association (of which FIFPro is a member) has, on 4 June 2020, issued ‘Guiding Principles for a Safe Return to Work and Play’, which identifies 6 essential elements to form part of any return to play agreement, and to provide for the ongoing monitoring of return to play. These are:</p>
<p>The public health crisis in the relevant markets must be under control. Players must be protected against the unique individual and environmental risks COVID-19 poses to their health &amp; safety and be able to access the highest standards of treatment and medical care should they contract COVID-19. Players must not bear the legal, economic and health-based risks of return to play. Adequate mental health and social wellbeing support mechanisms must be available. The usual high standards of player health and safety that are essential given the inherent risk of the sports workplace must continue to be made available. Given the foreseeability of a second wave of the pandemic, each sport needs a transparent ‘Plan B’.</p>
<p>In England, players are protected from returning to play by principles of employment law, if they believe that doing so would put them/their family members at risk of contracting COVID-19. Additionally, the government’s 5 stage protocol requires player’s to specifically “opt-in” for training, meaning that they are allowed to not to return, if they do not feel safe doing so. Indeed, it is in the interests of each club to ensure that measures are in place to ensure player health and safety.</p>
<p>Players and coaches in Spain are similarly protected under domestic law, however a refusal to return to play despite safety measures adopted by clubs is likely to amount to a breach of contract.</p>
<p>Similarly, clubs (as employers) in Italy have a duty to ensure the health and safety of their players (being employees), drawing from the principle of the right to health protection enshrined by the Italian Constitution. Thus, players must establish (a) that their clubs have not adopted appropriate health and safety measures as a result of which (b) there is a real risk of infection, before they exercise their right to refuse to return to play.</p>
<p>While players in Germany have similar rights, a ‘mere risk’ of infection is not considered a sufficient justification to refuse to return to play. Any concerns must be substantiated.</p>
<p>Most countries outside the ‘Big 5’ have adopted general protocol to be followed for sport (e.g. India), if not more detailed ones for football specifically (see for e.g. Australia, USA).</p>
<p>The general approach seems to be that while clubs do have a duty to ensure the health and safety of players (in accordance with general principles of respective domestic laws), players who wish to refuse a return to play, must be justified in doing so, for example where the club fails to adopt safety measures.</p>
<p>Disciplinary/Regulatory Proceedings</p>
<p>Different approaches have been adopted by countries with respect to their football related disciplinary/regulatory proceedings.</p>
<p>In England, football disciplinary proceedings, to the extent there are any, have been proceeding as normal.</p>
<p>In contrast, such proceedings have been suspended by the DFB in Germany, where it is considered unfeasible to impose monetary penalties on clubs that are already struggling financially due to COVID-19. Similarly, activity before judicial bodies in Italy currently stands deferred, in line with the suspension of championships, pending resumption.</p>
<p>In countries like Belgium and the USA there has been no significant change to disciplinary proceedings and the regulatory process. Cameroon (for example) has suspended all proceedings, while Qatar has made adjustments to ensure that proceedings continue remotely, albeit at a reduced capacity.</p>
<p>Portugal is an example of a country that has initially suspended all deadlines, the federation has, as of 1 June 2020, reverted to standard procedure.</p>
<p>Insolvency Proceedings</p>
<p>No professional football clubs in England and in Italy have (as yet) been involved in insolvency proceedings as a result of COVID-19. However, as noted below it is predicted that dozens of clubs could potentially face administration/insolvency in the next few months unless things change.</p>
<p>In Spain, Malaga CF appears to be in financial difficulties (for the second time since 2018), however no proceedings have commenced. German club, Karlsruher SC (currently playing in the Second Division) came remarkably close to declaring bankruptcy but was able to avoid that by negotiating agreements with its two main creditors.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in England, Damien Collins MP (former Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee) sent a letter (co-signed by 18 MPs and other football executives) to The FA and EFL calling for urgent talks on football finance based on a six-point plan. This six-point plan included (among other things) the creation of a government backed financial assistance scheme for clubs to access funds to meet short term liabilities, in exchange for a minority-shareholdings in the club.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has escalated the financial strains on football clubs, forcing some into insolvency proceedings. However, in many cases these financial issues had been haunting some of these clubs well before the coronavirus broke out.</p>
<p>For instance, Colombia has seen 8 clubs involved in insolvency proceedings even before the coronavirus. Croatia had a club which was not given a license to participate due to failure to satisfy relevant licensing (financial) criteria.</p>
<p>Notably, in China 11 football clubs from the second and third professional divisions were not eligible to participate in the new season in accordance with CFA rules, for failing to settle the salaries owed to players or coaches within a specified time limit.</p>
<p>Moreover, there have been 5 clubs, including Tianjin Tianhai Football Club from the CSL, who voluntarily withdrew from the professional league due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Given the trying financial environment clubs find themselves in, there have been leagues, for example, the Danish league, who have decided, among other measures, to adjust the formal financial requirements for obtaining a club licence for 2020-21 season.</p>
<p>The unfortunate reality is that smaller clubs (all over the world), particularly those who rely heavily on match day revenue and sponsorship income will likely be impacted more severely by the negative knock-on effects of the virus, putting them at greater risk of folding.</p>
<p>Key contractual and legal principles at play</p>
<p>Termination of employment agreements for ‘force majeure’</p>
<p>As a general remark, it should be noted that football clubs are still obliged to pay their players in full, unless an agreement is reached with the players or where force majeure is considered appropriate grounds to terminate the employment contract.</p>
<p>Spain is relying on an ‘ERTE’ system (see below) to either suspend or modify employment contracts for force majeure reasons (clubs are prohibited from terminating contracts on grounds of the pandemic). In France, while the COVID-19 crisis might qualify as a force majeure event, it is unlikely that provisions under national legislation will be enforceable given that the crisis is likely to be temporary. Provisions allowing clubs in Germany to terminate the services of their players are considered difficult to invoke. While clubs in Italy are legally permitted to terminate contracts for force majeure (although considered a rarity in practice).</p>
<p>Standard professional player contracts in England do not contain a force majeure clause. As with other common law jurisdictions, force majeure is a contractual right and is therefore not applicable in the way it would be in civil law jurisdictions. However, the doctrine of frustration permits contracts that are impossible to be performed to be brought to an end. However, this is unlikely to be applicable, particularly in an employment context.</p>
<p>In The Netherlands, force majeure cannot be invoked to unilaterally terminate an employment contract, although a salary reduction might be possible. However, in other countries, such as Argentina and Croatia, force majeure clauses may generally lead to the suspension or even termination of a contract, with a provision for a reduced compensation (and in Argentina’s case, subject to the government’s latest decree).</p>
<p>In Romania, footballer contracts can be terminated for force majeure on account of the fact that they are classified as civil contracts rather than employment contracts under national law.</p>
<p>The legislation in Ukraine and Uruguay does not provide employers with the ability to unilaterally terminate, even in force majeure circumstances, while in Turkey a force majeure clause can trigger the termination of a contract.</p>
<p>Switzerland permits any party to terminate an employment relationship with immediate effect, where there is ‘good cause’. While the pandemic might well constitute a force majeure event, it is unlikely that such termination by clubs would be upheld by the courts.</p>
<p>In Australia, India and Japan the applicability of force majeure contracts depends upon the wording of the relevant contracts. Therefore, in the absence of an applicable force majeure or similar provision permitting termination, both clubs and football players are obliged to fulfil their contractual and economic obligations.</p>
<p>In common law jurisdictions, the doctrine of frustration may provide a remedy to parties who wish to terminate a contract where circumstances outside their control deem the contract impossible to perform.</p>
<p>(see fig. 1 below)</p>
<p>Fig. 1: Termination for force majeure in employment contracts: a snapshot</p>
<p>Permitted Not permitted If provided for in contract I. The Big 5 England ✔ (not the case with standard player contract) France ✔ (force majeure event must be considered final) Germany ✔ (exceedingly difficult to invoke) Italy ✔ Spain ✔ II. Examples in other jurisdictions Argentina ✔ (with reduced redundancy package and subject to government decree) Australia ✔ Croatia ✔ (with reduced redundancy package) India ✔ Japan ✔ The Netherlands ✔ Romania ✔ (player contracts specifically) Switzerland ✔ Turkey ✔ Ukraine ✔ Uruguay ✔</p>
<p>Unilateral suspension or modification of player contracts</p>
<p>In England, the terms of an employment contract can only be changed by mutual agreement. The position is similar in Germany. As with termination for force majeure, the principles governing the suspension and/or modification of employment contracts in Spain are founded in domestic employment law (the “ERTE” system), under which there is a general prohibition for employees to waive legally recognised rights.</p>
<p>Similarly, in France, suspension or modification, as opposed to termination in accordance with national legislation is a more practical if likely outcome. In Italy, the terms of an employment agreement can only be changed by mutual agreement. However, in case the parties do not reach an agreement, it is reasonable to expect a unilateral modification of the agreement by the club. Such a decision will be subject to the judgement of an arbitration body and the FIFA guidelines may be taken into account.</p>
<p>In Belgium, force majeure clauses may trigger the suspension but not termination of an employment contract. Contracts in Brazil may be unilaterally suspended, if provided for by a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>In The Netherlands, modification of salary is only possible as a last instance measure, and in the event that negotiations, at both collective and individual levels, do not lead to a fruitful resolution.</p>
<p>In Portugal, salary reductions are only permissible where: (a) the employee mutually consents to it; or (b) the working hours of employees are reduced so as to reflect a proportionate reduction of salary. In the case of a lay-off, the employee is entitled to be paid 2/3 of his monthly salary for the next 2 months.</p>
<p>In Chile, as well as in South Africa, unilateral termination or modification is not permissible. Contracts may only be terminated or modified if mutually agreed to by the parties. Similarly, in Russia, employment contracts can only be altered by the mutual consent of the parties, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. Interestingly, the pandemic (thus far) cannot be considered to be one of those exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>In Mexico, contracts can theoretically be suspended in the event of a government-declared ‘health contingency’. However, the government to date, has avoided invoking this provision, thereby encouraging employers to pay full salaries or mutually agree to any variations.</p>
<p>(see fig. 2 below)</p>
<p>Fig. 2: Unilateral suspension, or modification: a snapshot</p>
<p>Permitted Permitted with conditions Mutual consent only I. The Big 5 England ✔ France ✔ Germany ✔ Italy ✔ (in the event that individual negotiations/collective bargaining fails) Spain ✔ II. Examples in other jurisdictions Belgium ✔ Brazil ✔ (if provided for under a CBA) Chile ✔ Mexico ✔ (in the event of a ‘health contingency’) Portugal ✔ (lay off: employee entitled to 2/3 salary) Russia ✔ South Africa ✔ The Netherlands ✔ (last resort, in the event that individual/collective negotiations fail – applicable to modification of salary, not suspension.)</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>While each member association will be faced with its unique set of challenges in combating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the above comparative analysis seeks to highlight different examples of how member associations are dealing with the crisis.</p>
<p>Indeed, measures and initiatives taken across the board have been varied.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>All governments from the ‘Big 5’ leagues, as has been the case with several other countries, have adopted exceptional measures to safeguard employment. Some have adopted unemployment benefit schemes while others have opened lines of credits for those affected, including football players and non-playing football club staff.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of jurisdictions under analysis, clubs have negotiated/are attempting to negotiate salary cuts from a minimum of 10% (as in England and Spain) up to a maximum of 70% (for example, in accordance with Spanish law).</p>
<p>FIFA, UEFA and CONMEBOL have allocated financial resources to their national member associations while federations and/or leagues, (for example, Germany and England, to name a few) have created special reserve funds for the clubs in need due to the current crisis.</p>
<p>Top clubs in Germany have donated money to those lower down the pyramid, facing bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Player’s unions such as the PFA in England have dedicated hardship funds to which players can apply to claim assistance.</p>
<p>Finally, some players have voluntarily waived part of their remuneration, as is the case with those from Athletic Club de Bilbao, AS Roma and Juventus.</p>
<p>The current crisis has left many clubs with cash flow problems for the foreseeable future, with potentially fatal knock-on effects. As such, it is imperative to look at the medium to long term, in order to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on the football industry.</p>
<p>While federations have acknowledged (and in some cases endorsed) the FIFA guidelines, the reality remains that steps taken by each federation would always be subject to domestic laws.</p>
<p>The crisis creates an opportunity for stakeholders to make football more sustainable by exploring:</p>
<p>setting up specific “reserve” funds which cover future force majeure events;</p>
<p>revisiting the funding of lower level and grassroots football both at national and at international level; and</p>
<p>reforming the accounting rules and procedures of all clubs to increase transparency and accountability amongst executives.</p>
<p>This pandemic has changed the way sport and more specifically, football will approach legal and contractual relationships. Both commercial (i.e. sponsorship or broadcasting) and employment-related contracts will provide for more robust force majeure clauses (or clauses with similar effect), while players will bargain (whether individually or collectively) for measures to protect themselves legally and contractually going forward. And while all stakeholders hope to never witness a catastrophe of this magnitude again, it is certainly hoped that the industry will be better prepared for the future.</p>

<p>SECTION I</p>
<p>THE “BIG FIVE” LEAGUES</p>
<p>ENGLAND</p>
<p>By Tiran Gunawardena[18]</p>
<p>What is the current status of the championships in your country (professional and amateur categories)? Suspension of any sports activity (training and/or games?), championship over?</p>
<p>On 28 May 2020, the Premier League announced that the season would restart on 17 June 2020. A few days later, the English Football League (“EFL”) announced that the Championship would resume on 20 June 2020. League Two clubs have agreed to end the season with immediate effect, while League One is deciding shortly whether it will follow suit or wait to try to return to competition.</p>
<p>The Football Association (“The FA”) has taken the decision to cancel all the seasons for the leagues below the National League (i.e. 8th division and below) and expunge the results (i.e. it will be as if the season never happened). Legal action has been mooted. The Women’s Super League and Women&rsquo;s Championship seasons have also been ended immediately, with the outcomes of the season still to be decided.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that decisions about the Premier League’s season will be made by the Premier League Board (on behalf of the 20 member clubs), and decisions regarding the Championship and League One will be made by the EFL - on behalf of its member clubs. Due to the structure of English football, those decisions will not be taken by the national association (i.e. The FA). However, The FA is certainly involved in discussions/negotiations with both the Premier League and EFL.</p>
<p>Has the Government/Federation/League adopted measures relating to:</p>
<p>The return to team training (for example by way of guidelines, a minimum period of training before competition, social distancing norms and frequency of testing); and/or</p>
<p>On 27 May 2020, Premier League clubs unanimously voted to resume contact training, as part of Phase Two of “Project Restart.” The decision to return to contact training was agreed following consultation with clubs, players, managers, the Professional Football Association (“PFA”), the League Managers Association (“LMA”) and the government.</p>
<p>With the Premier League season set to resume on 17 June 2020, Premier League players and staff will continue to be tested twice a week for coronavirus. At the time of writing, 8 players had tested positive after 1,744 tests across the league.</p>
<p>Players at Championship clubs returned to training on 25 May 2020, taking part in non-contact sessions and training in small groups. Those players will also continue to be tested for the virus. At the time of writing, 2 out of the 1,014 Championship players and staff tested positive.</p>
<p>The return to competition (for example by way of altered the rules and/or format of competitions, shortening of competitions, competitions to be played in specified locations, games behind closed doors, social distancing and testing frequency)?</p>
<p>When football returns in England it will be behind closed doors. There are 92 Premier League fixtures left to play in a little over 6 weeks’ time (as the Premier League hopes to conclude the season by the end of July 2020). The Championship has 108 matches, plus play-off semi-finals and a final to play. The EFL hopes to complete the Championship on or about 30 July 2020.</p>
<p>Most fixtures will be played at the scheduled venues, but it has been reported that some high profile matches (e.g. the Merseyside derby at which Liverpool FC might clinch the title) might be played at neutral venues. The rationale for using neutral venues is the perceived fear that supporters could congregate around the venue in contravention of government guidelines on social distancing.</p>
<p>The government also recently issued safety guidelines regarding returning to competition, including 8 minimum standards covering issues such as the availability of PPE, appropriate competition venues and adequate decision making structures and procedures. Decisions will remain subject to the continuing fight against coronavirus and ongoing government advice.</p>
<p>FIFA have announced a temporary amendment to the laws of the game to allow for a maximum of 5 substitutes. The Premier League and EFL will eventually vote on whether to permit this when the season resumes.</p>
<p>Do players, coaches or staff have the right to refuse to return to training/play if they believe that doing so would be a threat to their health and safety or vulnerable members of their family? What, if any, are the legal provisions in place to protect players, coaches or staff in such scenarios?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, under UK employment law there are protections in place for employees not to suffer a ‘detriment’ as a consequence of raising legitimate health and safety complaints.</p>
<p>As a starting point, clubs will need to ensure that they are providing the safest possible environment for players to return to train/play – e.g. with frequent testing, strict and enhanced hygiene measures, a staged return to training etc.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a player’s refusal to return to training/play due to a belief that he will be at risk of contracting COVID-19 could be protected under section 100 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA 1996) - which protects employees from dismissal on the grounds of absence from work if that absence was due to a reasonable belief that attending work would put them in serious and imminent danger (and they could not reasonably have been expected to avert that danger). The context of a player’s/coach’s/staff member’s refusal to return to training/play would need to be closely considered by a club before any disciplinary action was taken. Certain dismissals related to the raising of health and safety concerns amount to automatically unfair dismissals which do not require the usual 2 years’ qualifying service, and action short of dismissal on these grounds could amount to a detriment which is unlawful under section 44 of the ERA 1996.</p>
<p>The government has also issued guidance on the five stage framework for returning to full unrestricted elite sporting competition. In the guidance for Stage One and Stage Two (where we currently are), it states that players need to actively ‘opt in’ before engaging in Stage One training (after being briefed about the risks and safety protocols in place etc.), and also should be clear on the route to ‘opt out’ of the training environment “at any time without any resulting discrimination not associated with the potential natural competitive impact resulting from any loss of training time.”</p>
<p>In practice, we understand that clubs are generally respecting the legitimate concerns of players who do not feel safe to return (those with pregnant wives, vulnerable family members etc.). Moreover, the statistical risk around BAME players contracting COVID-19 is very much at the forefront of everyone’s minds in planning a safe return to play.</p>
<p>A high profile example of a player in the Premier League who did not want to return to training was Troy Deeney, the Watford FC captain, whose son has a health condition. Deeney also raised concerns about the disproportionate amount of coronavirus deaths in the BAME community. However, on 28 May 2020 Deeney stated that he will return to training after holding positive talks with the government&rsquo;s deputy chief medical officer.</p>
<p>What are the specific measures taken by:</p>
<p>The Government (unemployment benefits foreseen for workers in general? Other specific measures?)</p>
<p>The government introduced the ‘Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme’ (the “Scheme”) for all employees in the UK, under which a company can furlough employees and apply for a grant from the Government that covers 80% of their usual monthly wage costs, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month.</p>
<p>The Scheme has been designed to avoid mass redundancies across the UK. Football clubs are entitled to apply for the scheme – although politicians have used this as an opportunity to argue that footballers shouldn’t be put on the Scheme even if they’re entitled to be. Employers are entitled to ‘top up’ the furloughed salary to 100% if they wish. In football, the starting position is that clubs are ‘topping up’ furloughed players’ salaries to 100%, however as set out below in some instances clubs and players have reached alternative arrangements.</p>
<p>The employment status of players doesn’t change while they’re furloughed, but the players/employees are not permitted to do any work in any capacity for their employer. Training at home is permitted while on furlough. So, in practical terms, prior to team training resuming a week ago, players could have been furloughed but training on their own at home. However, now that (non-contact) team training has resumed, we assume that any players brought back to clubs to engage in team training will no longer be furloughed.</p>
<p>You would likely have seen in the press that some Premier League clubs initially sought to furlough their non-playing staff, which was a PR disaster. Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur initially took the decision to furlough their non-playing staff, despite their respective owners being billionaires and their players earning hundreds of thousands of pounds a week. The negative publicity forced those two clubs to reverse their decision. Newcastle United furloughed all non-playing staff and have, thus far, refused to reverse that decision despite the negative publicity.</p>
<p>Non-playing staff and also players lower down the English football pyramid have been furloughed. Clubs have made individual decisions as to whether to ‘top up’ furloughed players’ salaries to 100%.</p>
<p>The Federation and/or the League (common funding? Others?)</p>
<p>The Premier League has advanced funds of £125m to the EFL and National League. The EFL has created a £50m relief fund (which in effect is an advance on broadcasting payments), under which clubs will receive a grant and also be eligible to apply for interest free loans. Further measures will undoubtedly be required over the next few months. The players’ union (PFA) also has a hardship fund from which players can apply to claim assistance.</p>
<p>Is there any specific position taken by the Association of sports doctors? If yes, are the federations bound by such a decision?</p>
<p>There is no association of sports doctors that make any decisions which are binding on the football leagues.</p>
<p>How are clubs currently tackling the salary issue (suspension of payment of salary (for how long)? No payment at all?)?</p>
<p>In short, there is no common approach.</p>
<p>The financial situation of English football clubs varies significantly from the top of the Premier League (e.g. Manchester City / Liverpool / Manchester United) down to the Championship and below. There is even quite a big disparity between clubs in the Championship. So it is all but impossible for there to be a ‘one size fits all’ solution.</p>
<p>Some clubs are continuing to pay salary and benefits in full but are using the Scheme for financial assistance. Other clubs are asking players to defer a fixed percentage of their salary and/or benefits to a later date, so they can deal with cash flow issues resulting from the suspension of professional football. Other clubs are asking players to take a temporary pay cut to salary and benefits. The size of the cut varies from club to club, but some are asking players to cut their salary to what the club can recoup from HMRC under the Scheme (i.e. 80% of salary up to £2,500 per month). By way of some high profile examples, Arsenal players accepted a 12.5% pay cut subject to performance incentives, Aston Villa players deferred 25% of salaries for 4 months, whilst Chelsea have been negotiating a pay cut with their players which is reported to be around 10%.</p>
<p>Some clubs are pushing players to accept pay cuts/deferrals on the basis of financial difficulty but are also simultaneously being linked in the press with new players in the transfer market. Their players have been more reluctant to take pay cuts/deferrals. At the top of the Premier League, although the players are on high salaries there appears to be a reluctance to accept pay cuts/deferrals. However, players at clubs such as Manchester United have instead of taking pay cuts/deferrals, donated 30% of their wages to the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
<p>The players are being advised to insist that any deferrals entered into are repaid in full before their club can access the transfer market, when it opens. This “embargo” is putting some clubs off the idea of cuts or deferrals for the sake of it.</p>
<p>Lower down the football pyramid (mainly in the Championship), many players are refusing to accept pay cuts / significant wage deferrals. The EFL and the PFA have agreed that deferrals can be discussed on a club by club basis, up to 25% for Leagues One and Two. But cuts have been ruled out by the players. In the absence of agreements, clubs have mooted some radical/controversial solutions - including league wide group administration or a £6k/week salary cap to try and force players’ hands. Whether such measures will be pursued (if they are even legal) remains to be seen. However, it does reveal the desperation of the situation. It is predicted that dozens of clubs in the EFL could potentially face administration/insolvency in the next few months if things continue like this.</p>
<p>(For full disclosure the author’s firm Mills &amp; Reeve LLP has been advising the PFA and its members throughout the COVID-19 crisis)</p>
<p>Do clubs negotiate with players, individually?</p>
<p>Yes. The PFA has been attempting to negotiate with clubs on behalf of players where possible, however individual clubs are pursuing negotiations with its players depending on their respective financial situations.</p>
<p>Have there been any negotiations and/or decisions taken at a collective level between trade unions and clubs/leagues/federations?</p>
<p>See the answers to 5 and 6 above. We understand that Premier League clubs are liaising with each other and similarly EFL clubs are also liaising with each other. There is also constant dialogue between the leagues, The FA, and the PFA. However, there are no ‘collective decisions’ being made per se, as it is up to each individual club and player to determine how it will proceed.</p>
<p>However, if any of the leagues wish to change their regulations – which would then impact on the players - then such matters need to go through the Professional Football Negotiation and Consultation Committee (PFNCC) – the collective bargaining body in England.</p>
<p>Does the national legal system recognise the concept of ‘Force Majeure’ (or any other concept having the same effect)? What are the contractual principles in your country at the basis of any decision taken by the Federation/leagues/clubs with regard to the suspension of salaries due to an event of force majeure like the coronavirus (ex. Termination of the contract? Suspensions of salary? Salary cuts and to what extent?)?</p>
<p>The terms of an employment agreement can only be changed by mutual agreement. An employer who imposes a contractual change (such as suspension of wages, wage cuts or deferrals) without the employee’s express or implied agreement will be in breach of contract and the original terms of the contract will remain in place.</p>
<p>The Premier League and EFL standard contracts (collectively bargained between the leagues and PFA) do not contain a force majeure clause. The common law doctrine of frustration is rarely applied, particularly in an employment context. Ordinarily, it is unlikely that employment contracts are frustrated because this would require the position to be so fundamentally different to that envisaged that performance becomes impossible.</p>
<p>However, it is possible that where a government instruction (or, indeed, other circumstances) prevent an employer from providing work to its employees, and prevents the employees from performing the work, employment contracts may be frustrated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is too soon to tell whether this will apply during the COVID-19 pandemic and it will remain a fact-specific question in any event. As far as we are aware, no club (at least in the top four divisions) has sought to rely on force majeure and/or frustration as yet.</p>
<p>In practice, if a club unilaterally imposes a pay cut/deferral etc. players could choose to terminate the contract. However, filing a claim for losses would take some time and the player will also likely not be able to join another club until football resumes. As a result, the player could be without an income for quite some time if he chooses to terminate. So the player would need to strongly consider his financial situation before making such a decision.</p>
<p>Is there any official reaction at national level to the FIFA guidelines on Coronavirus?</p>
<p>There has not been any official reaction as such. However, it is clear that some of FIFA’s recommendations cannot be enforced under English law.</p>
<p>For example, FIFA has proposed that expiring contracts (due to expire on 30 June 2020) are “extended until such time that the season actually does end.” However, as per question 6 above that cannot be unilaterally imposed by clubs on players under English employment law. If a player wishes to become a free agent on 30 June 2020 when his contract is set to expire, then he will be entitled to do so. Whether it makes financial sense for him to do so is a different question.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Premier League have confirmed that players and clubs can agree to short term extensions until the season ends (so long as both parties agree such an extension), and have until 23 June 2020 to agree those extensions. The EFL have stated that players who leave their clubs as free agents after 30 June 2020 and sign for another club cannot play for them until next season.</p>
<p>Unless a solution is agreed between pending free agents and clubs (e.g. a short extension), it is estimated that there could be almost 1,000 free agents in English football come 30 June 2020.</p>
<p>Have there been significant developments (e.g. termination/ renegotiation/reduction of consideration/claim for damages) relating to agreements with:</p>
<p>Broadcasters;</p>
<p>Interestingly, it has been announced that the remaining 92 Premier League matches will be split amongst Sky Sports (64), BT Sport (20), BBC (4) and Amazon Prime (4). Sky has been given 25 more fixtures than originally agreed, which Sky has said it will put on its free-to-air channel. In total, 29 matches will be free to watch.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the broadcasters didn’t ask for the extra fixtures, but the Premier League has taken the above approach to maintain its important relationships with its broadcast partners, whilst also being mindful of the government’s desire for these games to have the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>It has also been reported that there are ongoing negotiations regarding a potential £330m rebate from clubs to broadcasters. Whilst many clubs are unhappy at the prospect of a rebate, broadcasters are reportedly arguing that football being suspended from March 2020 onwards resulted in contractual obligations not being fulfilled, and the resumption of football behind closed doors devalues the product they initially paid for.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the latest reports suggested that the Premier League clubs and Sky had agreed to defer a portion of that rebate (over £170m) until the 2021/22 season in order to assist clubs with their cash flow. Interestingly, and alarmingly, reports also suggested that if the 2019/20 season failed to finish (which remains possible so long as COVID-19 continues) then a total of £762m would have to be paid back to domestic and international broadcasters. Moreover, solidarity payments to the EFL would fall by 25% in January 2021.</p>
<p>It is not surprising therefore that clubs are keen to do all they can to avoid such a scenario.</p>
<p>Sponsors</p>
<p>Whilst there has not been any significant developments in relation to sponsorships in football just yet, there is a growing expectation that sponsorship deals (such as shirt sponsorships which have been key revenue streams for English clubs) might not be as lucrative going forward as sponsors themselves are likely to reduce their spending on sponsorships due to their own financial hardships.</p>
<p>What is the status of disciplinary proceedings/regulatory oversight (including, for example, anti-doping testing) in your jurisdiction (for example, have they been relaxed, suspended or is it business as usual)?</p>
<p>Disciplinary proceedings in football – to the extent there are any - are proceeding as normal. With regards to anti-doping in football, the FA has not stated that its Anti-Doping Testing Programme has stopped and/or been reduced, so it is presumably business as usual.</p>
<p>In anti-doping more broadly, UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) has published a helpful Q&amp;A on their website regarding COVID-19. In short, on 17 March 2020 UKAD announced a reduction in the testing programme, but has stated that “athletes could still be tested, any time, any place.” UKAD states that its intelligence and investigations team are still working continues to “receive, assess and disseminate intelligence and act on it where necessary.” Further, the guidance states that hearings before the National Anti-Doping Panel are still taking place, but remotely.</p>
<p>Have any football clubs (or related bodies) been involved in insolvency proceedings as a result of the coronavirus (e.g. administration/bankruptcy/liquidation)?</p>
<p>At the time of writing, no professional football clubs in England have (as yet) been involved in insolvency proceedings as a result of COVID-19. However, as noted previously it is predicted that dozens of clubs in the EFL could potentially face administration/insolvency in the next few months unless things change.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that on 28 May 2020, Damien Collins MP (former Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee) sent a letter (co-signed by 18 MPs and other football executives) to The FA and EFL calling for urgent talks on football finance based on a six point plan. This six point plan included (among other things) the creation of a government backed financial assistance scheme for clubs to access funds to meet short term liabilities, in exchange for a minority shareholdings in the club.</p>
<p>FRANCE</p>
<p>By Jean-Michel Marmayou[19]</p>
<p>What is the current status of the championships in your country (professional and amateur categories)? Suspension of any sports activity (training and/or games?), championship over?</p>
<p>In France, in March 2020, the President of the Republic announced a general containment measure across the country. As a consequence, the government prohibited “any gathering, meeting or activity bringing together simultaneously more than 100 people in an enclosed or open environment […]” within the territory of France.</p>
<p>This ‘lockdown’ initially planned until 15 April 2020 was extended for the first time until 11 May 2020.</p>
<p>As of March 13, 2020, the Ligue de Football Professionnel’s (“LFP”) board of directors announced the suspension of the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 professional championships.</p>
<p>As of this date, each club had played 28 of their 38 matches, with the exception of RC Strasbourg and PSG, who had played 27 matches each when the league was suspended.</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister&rsquo;s decision, taken on 28 April 2020, to ban all football matches until September 2020, as expected the LFP declared an end to their professional championships on 30 April 2020. This makes France the first of the ‘big 5’ countries to formally end their seasons with:</p>
<p>PSG being awarded their seventh title in eight years</p>
<p>Amiens S.C and Toulouse FC relegated to Ligue 2,</p>
<p>Lyon finishing seventh, missing out on next season’s Europa League, and</p>
<p>Amiens and Lyon reportedly considering legal action against this decision[20].￼.</p>
<p>With regard to the amateur categories, on 16 April 2020 the federation Française de Football (“FFF”) decided to:</p>
<p>definitively stop all the championships with effect from 13 March 2020.</p>
<p>freeze the results of the rankings acquired at the time of the stoppage, according to the number of points obtained/number of games played in order to neutralise the effect of the matches carried over; and</p>
<p>limit the number of clubs relegated to one per group but fix the number of promoted clubs according to the relevant competition’s regulations.</p>
<p>No decision has been taken yet about the standings but in compliance with UEFA declarations, if the professional championships are not completed, there will be no “saison blanche” (white season), meaning champions will be declared based on performance thus far and the season will not be considered void (i.e. as if it never happened).</p>
<p>Has the Government/Federation/League adopted measures relating to:</p>
<p>Following the Prime Minister&rsquo;s declaration to the National Assembly dated April 28, 2020, the Professional Football League (LFP), decided to end all football championships and categorically ruled out a restart of the 2019 – 2020 season.</p>
<p>For the time being, a resumption of competitions (2020/2021 season) is planned for the end of August 2020. No protocol has yet been established, certainly because by August, the situation may drastically change.</p>
<p>On 11 May 2020, the Ministry of Sports published post-lockdown guidelines for sporting practice, intended for high-level athletes and professional athletes[21] and another one for collective sports[22].</p>
<p>The return to team training (for example by way of guidelines, a minimum period of training before competition, social distancing norms and frequency of testing); and/or</p>
<p>No specific protocol has been officially established as yet. It should however be noted that the government authorized the resumption of training on 2 June 2020 by the aforementioned decree n ° 020-663 of May 31, 2020, indicating that:</p>
<p>training takes place in conditions likely to allow compliance with a physical distance of two meters;</p>
<p>The collective changing rooms remain closed.</p>
<p>The clubs carry out COVID-19 screening tests, even for their asymptomatic employees.</p>
<p>The return to competition (for example by way of altered the rules and/or format of competitions, shortening of competitions, competitions to be played in specified locations, games behind closed doors, social distancing and testing frequency)?</p>
<p>No specific protocol has yet been officially established, certainly because by August the situation may greatly change. It is envisaged, but this may still change, that the first matches of August will be played behind closed doors or with a very limited number of supporters.</p>
<p>Do players, coaches or staff have the right to refuse to return to training/play if they believe that doing so would be a threat to their health and safety or vulnerable members of their family? What, if any, are the legal provisions in place to protect players, coaches or staff in such scenarios?</p>
<p>An employee can effectively refuse to return to work by invoking this reason and the normal rules of the labour code will apply. In particular that the employer has the ability to check the veracity of the reasons put forward by the employee.</p>
<p>What are the specific measures taken by:</p>
<p>The government (unemployment benefits foreseen for workers in general? Other specific measures?)</p>
<p>The government has facilitated the launch of a partial unemployment scheme which has been extended to professional football. In practice, the club compensates its players (and more generally all its employees) at 70% of their gross remuneration (approximately 84% net). Then the state reimburses the club, up to a maximum of €4,850 per employee.</p>
<p>The savings are significant for non-sports personnel but much less for players. In fact, the employer will only be reimbursed a marginal part of the salary due to the players.</p>
<p>As of 1 of June, the amount of compensation has been lowered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, putting the players on a partial unemployment scheme takes the pressure off club finances considerably.</p>
<p>In fact, the compensation paid to the players is not subject to social charges.</p>
<p>Finally, the French government has also set up a bank loan guarantee mechanism for all companies. Clubs are therefore able to negotiate state-guaranteed loans with their respective banks.</p>
<p>The federation and/or the league (common funding? Others?)</p>
<p>The terms of a collective solution are under discussion and will depend on the possibility of a continuation of the championship and especially on the payment of TV rights by broadcasters.</p>
<p>On 28 April 2020, the TV broadcasters agreed to pay a sum corresponding to the matches already played, but after negotiations with representatives of professional clubs, such broadcast payments were made at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Is there any specific position taken by the association of sports doctors? If yes, are the federations bound by such a decision?</p>
<p>Just before the Prime Minister&rsquo;s decision not to allow the resumption of the championships, the Association of French Professional Club Doctors (“AMCFP”) sent its recommendations for the resumption of Ligue 1 and Ligue 2.</p>
<p>While no longer relevant, the plan was to commence football in a phased manner as follows. This included a first phase of testing followed by 7 days of individual training after which training in small groups would be permissible in the 7 days that followed. Measures included:</p>
<p>taking the temperature of all those who entered training grounds (closed to the public);</p>
<p>the requirement for players to wear masks at all times when not doing physical exercise;</p>
<p>implementation of social distancing norms, even during training;</p>
<p>disinfecting equipment; and</p>
<p>equipping medical rooms to treat players if required.</p>
<p>These recommendations have obviously not been reviewed since that date</p>
<p>How are clubs currently tackling the salary issue (suspension of payment of salary (for how long)? No payment at all?)</p>
<p>They currently apply the above-mentioned partial unemployment benefits and try to negotiate wage cuts with their players.</p>
<p>Do clubs negotiate with players, individually?</p>
<p>French law requires clubs to negotiate individually. They can always try to negotiate at a collective level, but it is each employment contract that is legally binding. A player cannot be obliged to accept a salary cut even if all his teammates have accepted one.</p>
<p>Have there been any negotiations and/or decisions taken at a collective level between trade unions and clubs/leagues/federations?</p>
<p>There were negotiations with the national union of professional footballers (“UNFP”) which resulted in declarations of principle which are not binding on each employment contract:</p>
<p>reduce wages by 30% during the crisis; and</p>
<p>reimbursement of wage cuts after the crisis.</p>
<p>Does the national legal system recognise the concept of ‘Force Majeure’ (or any other concept having the same effect)? What are the contractual principles in your country at the basis of any decision taken by the federation/leagues/clubs with regard to the suspension of salaries due to an event of force majeure like the coronavirus (ex. Termination of the contract? Suspensions of salary? Salary cuts and to what extent?)</p>
<p>The employment contracts of professional footballers are framed by law pursuant to the Sports Code as well as by the Labour Code. These are fixed-term employment contracts known as “specific fixed-term contracts”. They can only end for the causes that the law provides for:</p>
<p>Agreement of the parties</p>
<p>Serious misconduct</p>
<p>Inaptitude of the employee</p>
<p>Signing of an open-ended employment contract</p>
<p>Force majeure: the COVID-19 crisis may constitute a case of force majeure but to cause a permanent breach of the employment contract it is necessary that the impossibility of work be final (i.e. the performance of the entire remainder of the contract must be impossible). However, the crisis will necessarily be temporary, and force majeure can at best only lead to a &ldquo;suspension&rdquo; of employment (partial unemployment).</p>
<p>Is there any official reaction at national level to the FIFA guidelines on Coronavirus?</p>
<p>No official reaction. In any event, the FIFA guidelines recognize the pre-eminence of national law and government decisions. The LFP and the FFF are obliged to take into account the decisions taken by the French government first.</p>
<p>Have there been significant developments (e.g. termination/ renegotiation/reduction of consideration/claim for damages) relating to agreements with:</p>
<p>Broadcasters;</p>
<p>TV broadcasters holding audiovisual rights over the period concerned refused to pay the sums relating to the cancelled matches and even obtained a reduction in the share of the sums due for matches which had already been played but not yet settled.</p>
<p>Sponsors</p>
<p>With regard to the sponsors of the clubs, it should be noted that some sponsors refused to pay the clubs, either because their contract permitted them to do so or because they no longer had the finances to pay (or both of them).</p>
<p>What is the status of disciplinary proceedings/regulatory oversight (including, for example, anti-doping testing) in your jurisdiction (for example, have they been relaxed, suspended or is it business as usual)?</p>
<p>Disciplinary procedures were put on hold with some being held via videoconference.</p>
<p>Doping control procedures have been materially slowed down because of the lock down</p>
<p>Have any football clubs (or related bodies) been involved in insolvency proceedings as a result of the coronavirus (e.g. administration/bankruptcy/liquidation)?</p>
<p>Not yet</p>
<p>GERMANY</p>
<p>By Philipp S. Fischinger[23]</p>
<p>What is the current status of the championships in your country (professional and amateur categories)? Suspension of any sports activity (training and/or games?), championship over?</p>
<p>In men’s football, the First Division (Bundesliga) and Second Division (2. Bundesliga) seasons have re-started with effect from the weekend of 15-17 May 2020, under the organisation of the Deutsche Fußball Liga, the German Football League (“DFL”).</p>
<p>In the meantime, four full match days have been completed in both divisions. Games were, of course, organised as so called “Geisterspiele” (ghost games, i.e. played behind closed doors) at which only a limited number of people (maximum 300) were permitted to be present at the stadium.</p>
<p>As far as the DFB-Pokal (cup competition) is concerned, the Deutscher Fußball Bund, German Football Association (DFB) has scheduled the semi-finals for 9-10 June 2020 and the final for 4 July 2020.</p>
<p>As decided by the “DFB-Bundestag” (that is the legislative body of the DFB) on May 25, 2020, the Third Division (3. Liga) has re-started on the weekend of 29-31 May 2020. The same is true for the Female First Division.</p>
<p>As far as amateur teams are concerned, the situation differs; insofar as it is up to the respective regional soccer associations and local governmental agencies to decide if, when and under what conditions team training and matches are to be resumed.</p>
<p>Has the government/federation/league adopted measures relating to:</p>
<p>The return to team training (for example by way of guidelines, a minimum period of training before competition, social distancing norms and frequency of testing); and/or</p>
<p>Before the championships re-started, team training on club grounds had re-commenced at the beginning of May (for the first and second divisions). However, even in the First Division there were some discussions regarding a potential distortion of competition because Werder Bremen claimed that it only had one week of team training. Much more significant is this issue concerning the planned re-start of the Third Division. In particular Hallescher FC claim a distortion of competition because 1) this team will only have one week of team training before its first scheduled match and 2) due to governmental restrictions it will not be able to play it’s “home games” in its own stadium.[24]</p>
<p>The return to competition (for example by way of altered the rules and/or format of competitions, shortening of competitions, competitions to be played in specified locations, games behind closed doors, social distancing and testing frequency)?</p>
<p>In principle, the re-started first and second division are playing by the same rules of the game as before. The only alteration of rules of the game concerns the number of players that can be substituted during a game. It was raised from 3 to 5. The experience during the two match days completed so far shows that some clubs make use of that and substitute 5 players during one game.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, games are allowed as “Geisterspiele” (ghost games = games without spectators)” only and social distancing has to be observed as much as possible. Players and the coaching staff are tested regularly. All persons involved have to stick to the hygienic concept[25] of the Task Force Sportmedizin/Sonderspielbetrieb (cf question 3c).</p>
<p>In the Third Division, a few teams might be forced to play their home games not in their own, but in another stadium. This is due to local political restrictions (e.g. Carl Zeiss Jena, Hallescher FC).[26]</p>
<p>Do players, coaches or staff have the right to refuse to return to training/play if they believe that doing so would be a threat to their health and safety or vulnerable members of their family? What, if any, are the legal provisions in place to protect players, coaches or staff in such scenarios?</p>
<p>An employee is allowed to refuse to go to work if a balancing of his interests with the interests of the employer demonstrates that performing his work is unacceptable for him. However, the “mere” risk of getting an infection like COVID-19 while working is, in general, not deemed sufficient under German law to give the employee the right of retention of his work. The situation changes however, if either the employer is not taking necessary and reasonable safety precautions to protect his employees and/or if the employee or persons that live with him in a household are members of a special risk group.</p>
<p>If the employee has the right of retention of his work and executes it, he is protected under statutory law against retaliation by the employer (e.g. termination of contract). If the employee offers to come back to work under the condition that the employer undertakes the necessary and reasonable safety precautions and the employer fails to do so, the employee is entitled to wage payment.</p>
<p>What are the specific measures taken by:</p>
<p>The government (unemployment benefits foreseen for workers in general? Other specific measures?)</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, employers in Germany can order the so-called “Kurzarbeit” (short-time work) for up to 12 months. Even a reduction to “Kurzarbeit Null” (reduction to zero) is possible. Thus, the employer does not have to pay wages anymore. As compensation, employees affected by such a measure are receiving “Kurzarbeitergeld” (short-time allowance) by the government that amounts up to 87 % of the last net income. The Kurzarbeit/Kurzarbeitergeld is also available for sport clubs. However, as the Kurzarbeitergeld cannot exceed €4623 per month net of tax, it is rather uninteresting for top earners as the income loss is extremely high.</p>
<p>The federation and/or the league (common funding? Others?)</p>
<p>The DFL has lent its support to the regional and local soccer associations with 1.5 Million Euro each[27]. The “DFB-Bundestag” established a Task Force “Financial Stability for the Third Division”, intending to promote greater financial stability in the third division for the future[28].</p>
<p>Fritz Keller, president of the DFB, announced in a press release that the regional associations will receive subsidies: €12 million from the DFB to the regional associations that, normally, is paid over a period of 12 months, is now available immediately to the full extent.</p>
<p>In addition, there has been an initiative by Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig (Germany’s representatives in the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League) to forgo €20 million and donate it to clubs that are in need of money. The DFL has decided to use part of this amount (€7.5 million) to help the clubs of the 3rd Division (3. Liga) and those of the female 1st Division (Frauen-Bundesliga)[29]. Each of these clubs will receive the same amount. Moreover, Keller, president of the DFB, announced that the DFB will subsidise other sports without releasing further details.</p>
<p>There are also private initiatives, e.g. “We kick Corona” by the German national players Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka (both FC Bayern Munich), that has raised more than €4.4 million so far to help smaller clubs.</p>
<p>The DFL will devote €500.000 euro to the general public in order to expand the testing capacities further.</p>
<p>Is there any specific position taken by the association of sports doctors? If yes, are the federations bound by such a decision?</p>
<p>The DFL established a “Task Force Sportmedizin/Sonderspielbetrieb” (Task Force of Sports Medicine, the “Task Force”) in March 2020 with the goal to ascertain (1) if a continuation of championship games appears to be justifiable from a medical point of view; and (2) to recommend specific measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The first two divisions re-commenced on the basis of the Task Force’s findings[30]. The other championships (Third Division, Female First Division) are required to observe the same rules.</p>
<p>The Task Force proposes strict hygienic measures, close-meshed testing and permanent monitoring. Germany appears to have more than enough test capacities. The DFL adopted these suggestions to convince the government to allow the commencement of football behind closed doors.</p>
<p>While the players on the field are not required to use protection masks, substitute players, coaches, managers and all other persons inside the stadium are obliged to do so.</p>
<p>How are clubs currently tackling the salary issue (suspension of payment of salary (for how long)? No payment at all?)</p>
<p>When the season remained suspended, there were many cases of players agreeing to temporary wage reductions, e.g. 20 % (Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfurt) or 10-20 % (Borussia Dortmund), in most cases for limited periods[31]. It is up to each individual agreement with respect to how long these salary cuts will be in force.</p>
<p>(and 6.) Do clubs negotiate with players, individually? Have there been any negotiations and/or decisions taken at a collective level between trade unions and clubs/leagues/federations?</p>
<p>Although a player’s union exists (“Vereinigung der Vertragsspieler”, VDV), collective bargaining agreements and agreements with works councils are virtually non-existent in German football. Therefore, all negotiations have to take place between the clubs and the individual players.</p>
<p>As mentioned above (question 4), temporary salary cuts are permissible only if agreed to by each player respectively.</p>
<p>Does the national legal system recognise the concept of ‘Force Majeure’ (or any other concept having the same effect)? What are the contractual principles in your country at the basis of any decision taken by the federation/leagues/clubs with regard to the suspension of salaries due to an event of force majeure like the coronavirus (e.g.. Termination of the contract? Suspensions of salary? Salary cuts and to what extent?)</p>
<p>Termination of contract: If a club decides to reduce the number of players it wants to employ it can terminate contracts with “surplus” players under German labour law. However, this is very difficult and hardly realistic.</p>
<p>Dismissal with the option of altered conditions of employment: in Germany it is possible to terminate and at the same time offer the continuation of the contract with altered conditions (e.g. reduced wages). However, such a termination with the goal of wage reductions is possible only under extreme conditions (it must be the last measure for the employer to avoid insolvency).</p>
<p>Suspension of salary is not possible under German law without the consent of the employee.</p>
<p>Salary cuts: as long as the 2019/2020 season was on hold, clubs were not required to pay bonuses (e.g. appearance bonuses [Einsatzprämie] or bonuses for winning games [Siegprämie]). The question, if they have to pay the base salary is currently under debate among German scholars. I am of the opinion that the clubs still have to pay base salary and I expect the courts to decide accordingly. The legal approach might (!) be different if the duty to pay wages, threatens the existence of a club. However, although the Federal Labour Court (“Bundesarbeitsgericht”) mentioned this potential exception to the duty to pay wages, it has never been applied in practice. Therefore, it is highly uncertain if a labour court will apply this exception.</p>
<p>Is there any official reaction at national level to the FIFA guidelines on Coronavirus?</p>
<p>The “DFB” (“Deutscher Fußballbund”) adapted its Spielordnung (‘rule of the game’) thus making an extension of the season beyond June 30 possible. In particular it declared that in such a case the players’ licences to play for their current club will continue to be valid in July etc. It also proclaimed its willingness to apply for a shift of the “Wechselperiode I” (transfer periode I, commonly referred to as the summer transfer window[32]￼.</p>
<p>Have there been significant developments (e.g. termination/ renegotiation/reduction of consideration/claim for damages) relating to agreements with:</p>
<p>Broadcasters: The DFL and most TV broadcasters (in particular “Sky”, “DAZN” and “ARD”) reached an agreement regarding the broadcasting rights. In May, 1/3 of the final outstanding instalment was paid, with the remaining 2/3 payable upon the completion of each match day. In return for their willingness to pay 1/3 upfront, TV broadcasters will benefit from a discount on the overall rate. If, however, the season is cancelled, the 1/3 paid upfront is required to be refunded to these broadcasters, at least in part. Further details are yet to be released. DAZN will broadcast nine games as well as the relegation games to the first and second divisions. These games will be co-broadcasted by Amazon. Amazon replaces Eurosport who cancelled its agreement with the DFL.</p>
<p>Sponsors: Obviously, the situation is difficult for many sponsors, in particular sponsors in the lower divisions that are often not big companies anyway. It is, therefore, expected that some sponsors will stop its financial engagement while others will cut their funding to some extent. At this point, however, details are not yet published.</p>
<p>What is the status of disciplinary proceedings/regulatory oversight (including, for example, anti-doping testing) in your jurisdiction (for example, have they been relaxed, suspended or is it business as usual)?</p>
<p>The DFB Sportgericht (“Sports court”) has suspended all proceedings. In particular the DFB does not consider it to be feasible to impose monetary penalties on clubs that are already struggling financially due to Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Anti-doping testing is immensely reduced since the outbreak of the Coronavirus as many doping control officers are focusing on conducting tests for COVID-19. There are plans that athletes shall take their blood themselves during video calls and send it in.</p>
<p>Have any football clubs (or related bodies) been involved in insolvency proceedings as a result of the coronavirus (e.g. administration/bankruptcy/liquidation)?</p>
<p>The Karlsruher SC (currently playing in the Second Division) came remarkably close to declaring bankruptcy but was able to avoid that by negotiating agreements with its two main creditors.</p>
<p>ITALY</p>
<p>By Salvatore Civale[33]and Alessandro Coni[34]</p>
<p>What is the current status of the championships in your country (professional and amateur categories)? Suspension of any sports activity (training and/or games?) , championship over?</p>
<p>All competitions have been suspended at the beginning of March. On 9 March 2020 the Government ordered a nationwide lockdown, which ended on 4 May 2020.</p>
<p>With the spread of COVID-19 considerably decreased, the government has approved a plan to gradually resume all the sports activities, pursuant to certain recommendations and measures aimed at preventing further infection.</p>
<p>As per the provision 195/A dated as 18 May 2020, the Italian Football Federation (“FIGC”) suspended all the competitions until 14 June 2020.</p>
<p>On 20 May 2020, the FIGC issued an official statement declaring its intention to resume all the professional football competitions.</p>
<p>Following this, the Federation released a final version of its protocol containing all the measures, intended to players, clubs and facilities managers, deemed necessary to resume the matches behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Such version follows the previous drafts that were not accepted respectively by the Scientific Committee of the Central Government and the Serie A League (L.N.P.A.). In view of the comments received, the FIGC has amended its guidelines in order to publish a document with shared views. The latest version was then submitted to the Ministry of Health and subsequently approved.</p>
<p>This decision only affects professional football championships, since the National Amateur Football League (“LND”), cancelled all amateur competition as of 20 May 2020.The cancellation of amateur championships has been ratified by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). Any determination regarding the relevant award of the title and the relegation is still pending.</p>
<p>As per the decision dated as 29 May 2020 Serie A is set to resume on 20 June.</p>
<p>The second and third tier football championships, respectively Serie B and Lega Pro, will resume too. The nationa

These days, it’s not easy having a name like Corona.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old Corona De Vries discovered as much when bullies at his school in Helensvale, Australia, started calling him “coronavirus.” He used to love his name, he said, but now the incessant taunting was making him “sad and angry.”</p>
<p>Along came Tom Hanks — and a typewriter — to cheer him up.</p>
<p>Hanks, the first U.S. celebrity to announce he had contracted the virus, sent the grade-schooler a heartfelt letter earlier this month, an Australian television station reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Thank you for being such a good friend,” the beloved Hollywood actor wrote. “Friends make their friends feel good even when they are down.”</p>
<p>In March, Hanks revealed that both he and his wife, the singer Rita Wilson, had tested positive while in Australia, where he was getting ready to film an Elvis Presley biopic. When Corona heard about the diagnosis, he sent the two-time Oscar winner a letter.</p>
<p>Tom Hanks has written a heart-felt letter to a young Helensvale boy named Corona. The 8-year-old was being bullied at&hellip; Posted by 7NEWS Gold Coast on Thursday, April 23, 2020</p>
<p>“I heard on the news you and your wife had caught the coronavirus,” the boy wrote, according to 7News Gold Coast. “Are you OK?”</p>
<p>The actor felt “blah,” he had said on social media, but appeared to be in good spirits. After being released from a Queensland hospital and quarantining themselves, Hanks and Wilson had returned home to California. That’s where he sent the boy a response.</p>
<p>“You know, you are the only person I’ve ever known to have the name Corona — like the ring around the sun, a crown,” his letter said.</p>
<p>Hanks also included a present: a typewriter the actor had taken with him to Australia’s Gold Coast that perhaps suited the 8-year-old, too.</p>
<p>“Ask a grown up how it works. And use it to write me back,” the “Toy Story” star wrote. “You’ve got a friend in me.”

<h3 id="coronavirus-pandemic">&ldquo;Coronavirus pandemic&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Lowy_DefaultImage_new.jpg" alt="img">
Among the weapons Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has deployed in the early stages of the battle to slow the spread of the coronavirus was an appeal for the assertion of our “culture”.</p>
<p>Attempting to shame into submission the hordes who were storming supermarkets and coming to blows in the toilet rolls aisles, Morrison pleaded: “Stop it. It’s un-Australian”</p>
<p>What this actually meant is hard to say. What is appropriate Australian behaviour? What did he see in our national character that he considered this behaviour infringed and which he thought, by drawing attention to, he could stop?</p>
<p>A week later, after days of the government and medical experts calling on people to stay inside or, if they had to go out, keep a healthy distance from each other, images flashed around the world of Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach packed to the gunwales with defiant beachgoers.</p>
<p>Social distancing in Bondi pic.twitter.com/UwgJFwhHiH — Tom Steinfort (@tomsteinfort) March 20, 2020</p>
<p>If there is anything that symbolises Australian “culture”, it is such beach scenes. And the fact that this was happening despite the dire warnings about the risks of close contact might be seen to reflect another identifying feature of Australian “culture” – that laid-back attitude of “she’ll be right”.</p>
<p>The government’s response to this was to force the closure of the beach, surely an action which would normally be about as “un-Australian” as you could get.</p>
<p>As the coronavirus has seeped its insidious way around the globe and governments and their populations have been forced to reckon with it, the science has suggested that there is really only one clear option available to slow its spread until a vaccine against it is found. That is to isolate citizens from each other and adopt stringent hygiene standards.</p>
<p>But the responses in different countries and by different governments have been far from uniform.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of this now global crisis, political-cultural forces have worked against the containment of the virus.</p>
<p>Different cultures and traditions have produced starkly different behaviours, both by citizens and by governments aware of and sensitive to those cultures and traditions.</p>
<p>Religion, custom, social norms, political imperatives, attitudes of populations to authority, attitudes of authorities to their populations – a wide range of different influences have resulted in a wide range of behaviours.</p>
<p>In the major cities of Georgia, for example, trucks carrying Orthodox priests ply the streets sprinkling holy water and blessing crowds of citizens who came out, believing their faith will protect them. In the US, long queues of people stand waiting outside gun shops to buy weapons which they believe they might need to protect their supplies of vital goods (toilet paper included, no doubt) from desperate fellow citizens. In the UK, elderly citizens invoke memories of their stoicism during the Second World War blitz to persuade younger people to join the “coronavirus Battle of Britain”. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel summons the spirit of solidarity that followed the reunification of East and West to urge her people to stand together against the virus, but she struggles against the powerful post–Cold War sentiment that favours individual liberty.</p>
<p>For some, aspects of social distancing came naturally. Germans always queue respectfully and patiently. To the English, queuing is instinctive.</p>
<p>But from the very beginning of this now global crisis, political-cultural forces have worked against the containment of the virus. When coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, the instinct of the secretive Communist central government was to cover it up and to punish those who revealed its existence.</p>
<p>Once the terrible truth was out, however, the power of the authoritarian Beijing government was used to force compliance by all the citizens of the affected areas to adopt defensive measures that have resulted in the first successful containment of the virus.</p>
<p>Join the “coronavirus Battle of Britain” (Number 10/Flickr)</p>
<p>In stark contrast, in Italy, which took over from China as the country worst affected by the virus, deep political fissures in the country contributed to catastrophic confusion about how best to deal with the initial outbreak of the virus in the Lombardy region. The right-wing Northern League party, which dominates this proudly independent region, resisted adopting policies directed by the government in Rome. When Rome attempted to impose a lockdown in the north, more than a million people fled to the south where there was no lockdown, taking the virus with them and spreading it further.</p>
<p>In the UK, which initially flirted with allowing the virus to run its course and developing “herd immunity”, thus delaying containment measures, the government hesitated to rescind what Prime Minister Boris Johnson referred to as “the ancient and inalienable right of Englishmen to go to the pub”, and then profusely apologised when the numbers exercising this right became a threat to public safety and a lockdown had to be imposed.</p>
<p>Where lockdowns have been imposed, there have been uplifting manifestations of cultural differences.</p>
<p>What might be called “balcony communities” have suddenly flourished. In Italy, residents have come out to the only place they can see other people, brought musical instruments with them, and joined in rousing renditions of popular songs. In France and Spain crowds on balconies have cheered health workers on their way to their now dangerous work in hospitals and clinics. And in Brazil, an estimated 3 million people have used the platforms of their apartment balconies to hold loud political protests over their government’s initial denialist response to the virus.</p>

<p>Full Quarantine dance balcony party : pic.twitter.com/Si1hZHKc1P — Joyce Karam (@Joyce_Karam) March 17, 2020</p>
<p>But in Germany, apartment living was a major reason the government resisted a total lockdown. In the colder north, balconies are less common and apartments are smaller. Official advice to the government was that compulsory containment risked higher levels of domestic abuse and mental-health disorders.</p>
<p>Different faiths and religious beliefs have seen different public behaviours. In countries where the Christian and Muslim faiths are strong, religious leaders have resisted the closure of churches and places of prayer. Greek Orthodox priests have told believers they cannot catch the virus from the holy cup. In Saudi Arabia and Iran, angry mobs have stormed Mosques closed for health reasons. In South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, decisions to allow large religious assemblies to go ahead have seen spikes in the spread of the virus. Believers in many countries have been fatalistic about their prospects of catching the virus, believing that their fate is in the hands of God.</p>
<p>Different experiences of political systems have also produced varied public responses to government campaigns to contain the virus.</p>
<p>Eastern Europeans, Russians, Iranians, and others who, from experience, do not generally trust what their governments tell them see government announcements on responses to the virus with a wary eye, too well aware of the difference between propaganda and truth.</p>
<p>In the US, where trust in government and suspicion of public officials has been in long decline, recent polls showed a majority of Americans were suspicious of official warnings about the degree of the coronavirus threat. Only 40% of Republicans saw it as “a real threat”, compared to 75% of Democrats.</p>
<p>In California, a Democratic stronghold, Governor Gavin Newsom ordered a lockdown of the state, but he hesitated to ask state police to enforce the lockdown, preferring citizens to “voluntarily regulate”.</p>
<p>This despite the fact that the US has one of the steepest upward curves in rates of infection.</p>
<p>In Japan, by contrast, where public obedience to authority is very strong, community responses to government coronavirus campaigns have been overwhelmingly positive. Japan has one of the lowest growth curves in rates of infection. Similarly, in South Korea and Singapore, a culture of public obedience has helped authorities.</p>
<p>Differing experiences of national security environments has also shaped policy and responses to it.</p>

<p>In Israel, where draconian antiterror laws have long existed and official mass surveillance systems have been widely deployed, the government has mobilised these antiterror systems for public-health protection. Israeli carriers of the virus who defy bans on their movement can be identified by mobile tracking systems and apprehended. Healthy people going about their business who come in contact with an identified carrier can get a text message from authorities alerting them to the fact. There are concerns that this sort of surveillance for reasons other than counterterrorism might persist after the virus threat has passed, but there seems to be general public support for these measures at present.</p>
<p>As we enter an uncertain future, the potential of the virus to profoundly change the way the political world works is one of the greatest uncertainties. Depending on the severity and duration of the impacts of the virus on different populations, political upheavals seem certain to follow. Leaders will be tested and some will fail the test, none more so than US President Donald Trump as he faces his second-term election test in November. Systems of economic management will be tested, in particular where free-market ideology has dominated policy. Again, that means the US, but also the West more broadly, including Australia.</p>
<p>One of the most profound and important developments in global affairs since the Second World War – the creation of the European Union – will have its raison d’être and its cohesion profoundly tested.</p>
<p>At the centre of the European project has been the idea of creating a single European identity over the top of the national identities of its 27 member countries. The idea of lots of cultures under one unifying European culture has been at the heart of the EU’s evolution. The most important expression of this is the single market without internal borders.</p>
<p>The spread of the coronavirus in Europe – turning it into the epicentre of the crisis – has resulted in those internal borders beginning to be reimposed. One immediate result of this has been massive internal traffic jams and some of the major arteries of the European freight transport system ceasing to function.</p>
<p>The same is beginning to happen to people, including with European leaders shutting down the entry of refugees and asylum seekers, condemning large numbers of refugees from the Middle East being trapped in dire circumstances in camps on the EU’s borders, where they have been in limbo because of the inability of European leaders to agree for years now on a comprehensive plan for dealing with the refugee crisis. For the foreseeable future, trying to deal with an invading virus will have priority over dealing with desperate people seeking sanctuary inside European borders.</p>
<p>The test that now faces the EU is an existential one. The unity that has been the key to the idea of the EU and a European identity now faces grave challenges from the risk that Europe’s nation states will decide going it alone is better.</p>
<p>When we finally emerge from the coronavirus nightmare – and it is impossible to say when that might be – we may find a permanently transformed world on the other side.</p>
