<p>Updated: Jun 24, 2020 14:36 IST</p>
<p>Late actor Inder Kumar’s wife Pallavi Kumar has claimed the Wanted actor was a victim of nepotism who was turned away by influential people in the industry. Pallavi penned a long note on her Instagram account on Monday along with a picture of Inder shaking hands with Shah Rukh at a party. Inder had died of cardiac arrest in 2017 at the age of 43.</p>
<p>She wrote, “These days everyone is talking about.. Nepotism&hellip;.Just like Sushant Singh Rajput my husband late actor Inder Kumar achieved his fame on his own. He was at a peak in 90s. Before he passed away I still remember he went to 2 people big shots asking for work as help. Just for the record he was already doing small projects. But he wanted to do big movies just like he started. He went to Mr. Karan johar, I was there too. In front of me all happened. He made us wait outside his van for 2 hrs. Then his manager Garima comes and says karan is busy. But we waited &amp; wen he came out, he says inder keep in touch with garima at the moment there is no work for you. And inder did that&hellip; for the next 15 days &hellip; the fone was picked up saying there is no work at the moment&hellip; after that inder was blocked.”</p>
<p>She went on to add, “The same behaviour was given to Inder by non other than Mr. Shah Rukh Khan&hellip; He met inder and said he will call you in a week . At the moment there is no work.this all happened on the set of Zero. Later was even asked to keep in touch with his manger Pooja&hellip; she did the same wat garima did&hellip;. Can one imagine and believe dat there has not been any work available in these two production houses.”</p>
<p>Talking about nepotism at large, Pallavi wrote, “Karan johar has said many times he works with stars&hellip; well my husband was a star &hellip; still people remember him by his work. Why is it so difficult for these big shots to help talented people. What are they scared of ? Or we can just say they are bad human beings&hellip; pretending to be nice. Nepotism should stop&hellip; people are dieing and these big shots are still not understanding the effect. Government should take strict action against such people.”</p>
<p>She had also penned a note a day after Sushant’s death by suicide. Sharing a collage of Sushant and Inder’s pictures, she wrote, “A biggest laugh to Bollywood from my side. Since 2 days I see people saying that this industry is very helpful. But one has to fight his or her own problems. Suicide is not an answer&hellip;. nor is heart attack&hellip;. REALLY !!!!!! Can anyone please answer that when he or she tries to fight their problems &hellip;. goes to people of the industry asking for help&hellip;.Then why nobody helps &hellip;&hellip; situation of their problems make them beg&hellip; tab bade log kyu nahi help karte&hellip;. aisa toh nahi hai ki help karne se unka career khatam ho jayega&hellip;. (why don’t established people help at that time&hellip;.it’s not that their careers will be over by helping someone) that time why can’t they be only Human&hellip;.and show some humanity&hellip;.I have suffered the pain&hellip; and have been the eye witness to the un helpful attitude of Bollywood.”</p>
<p>Also read: When Sushant Singh Rajput said he feared death: ‘To not know who you are is slightly scary’</p>
<p>Inder is remembered for his performances in films such as Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge, Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye and Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi. He also played the lead role of Mihir Virani in Ekta Kapoor’s TV show Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi for some time.</p>

<h3 id="i-cant-wait-to-fall-in-love---rakul-preet-singh">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to fall in love - Rakul Preet Singh&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2020/jun/rakulpreetsingh101592907890.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>From the stark military background to the shimmery showbiz stage… dreamy-eyed Rakul Preet Singh has traversed the two worlds effortlessly. Armed with discipline, focus and willpower, the army girl applied these in her mercurial vocation and emerged trumps. The Femina Miss India made her Telugu debut in Keratam (2011) and Tamil debut in in Thadaiyara Thaakka the next year. Going on to enjoy massive popularity in the Telugu industry with films like Current Theega, Rough and Loukyam, the South megastar made her Bollywood debut in Yaariyan in 2014. Aiyaary and Marjaavaan were add-ons to her Hindi repertoire. But it was De De Pyaar De (DDPD) opposite Ajay Devgn that made Hindi audiences thaw to her talent and charm. Coming up are Attack with Arjun Kapoor and Indra Kumar’s comedy, Thank God, with Ajay Devgn, confirming she’s come home to the maximum city. Widely followed on Instagram, the millennial star says her postings are only to show her fans and followers how much she’s like them. Excerpts…</p>
<p>What took you so long to make a mark in Hindi films?</p>
<p>I’ve been busy doing South films. I thought I’d manage both. But both the industries work differently. So it became difficult. I’ve shifted my base to Mumbai now. I’m happy that it happened after so many years because I gained experience being before the camera. I grew in touch with my craft. Or else I couldn’t have pulled off Aisha’s character in De De Pyaar De (DDPD). I was a kid when I did Yaariyan. My role in DDPD was full-fledged, a show reel where I had to dance, show emotions… everything. I want to keep experimenting and do different roles. Modern, girl-next-door, glam, no-glam&hellip; Playing varied roles is a high for any actor. Even if I act in one cult film – like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge or Jab We Met – in my career I’ll be happy.</p>
<p>Did you always aspire to be an actress?</p>
<p>I was not filmi. My father was in the army. We used to stay around the border. We used to watch films on VCR, months after they were released. We didn’t have TV till I was in class four. Dad wanted us to do outdoor activities. I began watching and enjoying films only after the ninth standard when we came to Delhi. Every girl somewhere wants to be an actor. After finishing my studies, I thought I’d give it a try. I gave myself two years to try my luck in films. I moved to Mumbai. Luckily, things worked out.</p>
<p>How has the trek been?</p>
<p>Nothing comes without a struggle. I am spiritual so I hate the word struggle. It’s so negative. You’ll only find it a struggle when you do something, which you don’t want to. Acting is my passion. So the struggle itself becomes sweet. I had never faced a camera in my life. I learnt everything on the job. That’s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>What are your takeaways from the disappointments?</p>
<p>When you’ve auditioned from door to door and waited so many years – you value your work. You value time. I knew the journey would be tough. But what’s the fun if it’s easy? I don’t crib about it. The profession taught me to have a strong willpower, believe in myself and remain focussed and disciplined. If you don’t give your 100 per cent, you’ll never get 100 per cent. Before Yaariyan, I was told I had a generic face. But I accepted it. It made me believe in myself all the more. You just become stronger emotionally and mentally.</p>
<p>What have you discovered about yourself in the last few years?</p>
<p>That I am a workaholic. Feeling tired is just a state of mind. I love my work so much that I can go on working. I have that drive. I can push myself. My willpower has been tested time and again. I’m glad I possess it. Choose a job from which you don’t need a vacation. I can work 360 days a year.</p>
<p>Do you believe socialising/networking is necessary to further opportunities?</p>
<p>In any profession, networking is important. But partying is not going to get you a film. Ultimately, it’s your talent that will work. I like to hang out with people. I love socialising. But I don’t</p>
<p>like to talk work when I socialise. Relationships forged without career concerns are the ones that matter the most.</p>
<p>What do you love the most about your profession?</p>
<p>Just being in front of the camera. I love being a different person every day. I love to go on the set, act, feel&hellip; It’s such a beautiful job where you get to express different emotions. You might not have love in your life but on screen you create the idea of romance. It gives you so much to tap internally.</p>
<p>How do you stay real in a glamorous world?</p>
<p>Acting is just a job for me. Once I come home, I’m like a girl-next- door. I don’t take myself so seriously. We should have a life beyond films. Life needs to include other things. I read,I play golf, I hang out with my friends. I enjoy baking. It’s important to disconnect and be normal. It’s important to surround yourself with people, who can still yell at you… be it your school friends, parents or relatives. My family and friends give me a reality check.</p>
<p>You’re active on social media. Is it a necessity or do you enjoy it?</p>
<p>I’m more active on Instagram than Twitter. I can handle Insta myself. It’s a happier platform where people come together and share happy things. Twitter can sometimes get negative. There’s so much hatred in the world, which is why I don’t interact much there. Insta is a great platform to connect with people, who give you so much love. When they see my day-to-day life, behind-the-scene videos, they realise I’m a normal girl. I’m like anyone of you.</p>
<p>Are you single or attached?</p>
<p>(Smiles) Single since the past four years. My brother jokes saying I intimidate guys. I guess, work has taken priority. But if you find the right person you can always make time. I haven’t found the right person. But I truly will. I’m a believer in love.</p>
<p>What’s your kind of a guy?</p>
<p>My dream man has to be six-feet tall. I’m tall myself and I wear heels. Someone who’s a happy person with no hang-ups. Someone who’s driven. I don’t want all the money with no intellect and drive. Someone who’s focussed about his work and what he has to achieve. Someone who’s not only intelligent but</p>
<p>an intellectual.</p>
<p>Your concept of love…</p>
<p>Love is a beautiful emotion, which has lost its meaning today. In a way self-love and being selfless go hand in hand. Caring for others and at the same time respecting yourself. I should have been born in a purana zamana. I’ve an old-world view about love. Like how my parents are each other’s pillars. When I see Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma I’m like vow! Unko dekhkar you believe in love. You don’t have to be demanding in love. You just have to make each other’s lives better. It’s about giving and taking at the same time. Whether it’s with your friend, parents or your partner… it’s all about making the relationship worthwhile.</p>
<p>What cements a relationship?</p>
<p>Common interests. Because the initial attraction will fade if you don’t have anything to do beyond meeting for a few hours. Marriages are not surviving today because they were based on infatuation. If two people are first good friends, if they can sit for hours and share a conversation… it makes a relationship strong.</p>
<p>What kind of wedding would you like to have?</p>
<p>A destination wedding on the beach with just about 100 people. It will be a complete party. I have it all planned. I just have to find the guy.</p>
<p>Extrovert or introvert…</p>
<p>An extrovert. Some people find me intimidating. But after knowing me, they find me clumsy.</p>
<p>Emotional or practical…</p>
<p>A mix of both. I’m an emotional person but I take time to invest my emotions in someone.</p>
<p>I don’t wear my heart on my sleeves.</p>
<p>Success means…</p>
<p>How happy and content you are. What’s the point of all the money and fame if you don’t wake up happy?</p>
<p>What makes you happy?</p>
<p>Life. Actually, I’m spiritual. So nothing should make you happy or unhappy.</p>
<p>What irritates you?</p>
<p>People, who don’t take their job seriously, who don’t value time.</p>
<p>Do you believe in love at first sight?</p>
<p>No. That’s infatuation. Love is deep-rooted.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love?</p>
<p>I’m waiting to fall in love.</p>
<p>A quality that draws you to a man…</p>
<p>Intellect.</p>
<p>A trait that puts you off…</p>
<p>Showing off.</p>
<p>A dating tip…</p>
<p>Be who you are.</p>
<p>Describe a perfect kiss…</p>
<p>A perfect kiss doesn’t have to be described. It has to be felt.</p>
<p>If you catch your boyfriend cheating on you?</p>
<p>I’ll first ask why. But you can’t justify cheating in a relationship. So I’ll leave him.</p>
<p>Three things you do on the set…</p>
<p>If it’s an easy day, I read some scripts. I watch Netflix on my iPad or phone if I have a longer break.</p>
<p>Your travel wish list…</p>
<p>I want to go on a world tour and enjoy the cuisines in different countries. I am a foodie.</p>
<p>What makes a woman sexy?</p>
<p>Self-confidence.</p>
<p>Your sex-appeal lies in…</p>
<p>My soul.</p>
<p>One thing you want to change about yourself:</p>
<p>I’m too harsh on myself. Like if I have a 6 am shoot, I’ll work out at 4 am and then do yoga.</p>
<p>I don’t let go.
