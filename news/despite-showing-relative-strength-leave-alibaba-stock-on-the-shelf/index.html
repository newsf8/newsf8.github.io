<p>Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock has shown resilience during the market bloodbath, but make no mistake; the once-robust uptrend has taken serious damage. A fresh look at the price chart is needed to determine the best play on BABA stock in the current trading environment.</p>
<p>Source: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com</p>
<p>Since Alibaba is one of the biggest players in China’s stock market, let’s look at how the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:FXI) has fared relative to the disastrous drop in U.S. equities. From January’s peak to current lows, FXI has dropped by 26.9%.</p>
<p>By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) has a peak-to-trough drawdown of 32.8%. If you’re looking for a silver lining, China’s performance hasn’t been near as bad as America’s. If the relative strength persists, it will bode well for Alibaba.</p>
<p>Alibaba Stock Charts</p>
<p>The past month of selling has damaged both the daily and weekly trends.</p>
<p>On the weekly front, BABA has broken a prior pivot low as well as the 20- and 50-week moving averages. Both are reflective of a more serious correction and should give dip buyers pause.</p>
<p>The RSI indicator is sinking to the lower 40s, which places it into bearish territory. In case you’re curious, Alibaba stock has tracked FXI by matching its 26% decline.</p>
<p>Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade</p>
<p>The one bright note with the bigger picture is we are holding the lower trendline that has defined BABA’s trend since late 2018. This zone halted every one of last year’s pullbacks so its a good omen that buyers are willing to defend their turf once more. If you’re in the mood for bottom fishing based on a weekly retracement, I could see triggering a bullish trade over this week’s high ($189.39) with a stop under the low ($170).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my excitement for the trade idea sours when turning the daily chart. The sharp descent crashed through the 20-day, 50-day, and 20-day moving averages. Though we’re trying to climb back above the 200-day this morning, it’s been a struggle so far. Breaking horizontal support at $200 was particularly detrimental to BABA’s stock trend, and now sits atop the stock as a potential major resistance zone along with every moving averages.</p>
<p>Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, distribution days, or high volume bearish sessions, have multiplied showing strong selling pressure by the big boys.</p>
<p>The Bull and Bear Case</p>
<p>Let’s sum up the bearish and bullish arguments.</p>
<p>Bulls will argue Chinese stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts and Alibaba has held up relatively well during the meltdown. It’s holding a long-term trendline and is flashing a lower-risk entry for long-term investors.</p>
<p>Bears will contend that the weekly retracement is too deep and the RSI too low to justify purchasing. The daily time frame has a mountain of potential overhead resistance that threatens to stymie any upside reversal.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best trade is no trade. Since I find both arguments compelling, my suggestion is to play elsewhere. There are stronger stocks to buy and weaker ones to short.</p>

<h3 id="at-alibabas-lazada-coronavirus-measures-become-the-latest-culture-conflict">At Alibaba&rsquo;s Lazada, coronavirus measures become the latest culture conflict</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p0.kT5ofBq69nha8zmGs.g--~B/aD01NTE7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/768b42fd6ac19320ea433abf2a51ce3c" alt="img">
By Keith Zhai and Fanny Potkin</p>
<p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At Lazada, the Southeast Asian arm of Alibaba Group Holding &lt;BABA.N&gt;, staff are furious over demands they submit health reports daily and other coronavirus-prevention steps seen as too invasive, highlighting a long-running culture clash with management from China.</p>
<p>Since February, Singapore-based Lazada has asked all employees to answer detailed questions seven days a week about their health and where they have been lately, according to five people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>While the e-commerce firm describes the health reports as not mandatory, employees receive frequent calls from human resources, even on weekends, to make sure reports are submitted, the people said.</p>
<p>Lazada has also asked Singapore employees to wear masks at work, contrary to guidance from authorities, and has also considered urging employees to refrain from attending religious gatherings, they said.</p>
<p>The five employees, who said staff anger was widespread, detailed the measures to Reuters on condition of anonymity because they fear retribution. Three showed Reuters a copy of a health report they had submitted.</p>
<p>Such measures are not unusual in China, which has imposed draconian rules to contain the virus. But they are seen as a huge invasion of privacy by many Lazada staff in countries that include Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.</p>
<p>The conflict illustrates how Alibaba&rsquo;s business practices have sometimes played poorly abroad and hindered its overseas ambitions. It also shows how tensions can emerge within global companies as they struggle with the virus crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the company use the information gathered daily? Nobody is able to explain,&rdquo; said one of the employees, expressing concern that Lazada might pass on the information to governments.</p>
<p>Magnus Ekbom, Lazada Group Chief Strategy Officer, denied there were issues with staff unhappiness over the measures in a statement to Reuters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazada has a clear top priority to safeguard the well-being of our team and the community around us,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;Our approach is in line with the recommendations made by the various governments in nations we operate in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sources also say this is just the latest chapter in Alibaba&rsquo;s struggles to manage Lazada, a company it owns 90% of after investing $3 billion since 2016 and where morale has been rapidly declining.</p>
<p>Once the top e-commerce firm in Southeast Asia when Alibaba first invested, Lazada has now fallen behind rivals in a fast-growing market of 650 million Southeast Asia consumers across six countries, according to market researchers.</p>
<p>Underlining management woes have been the quick departures of Alibaba executives dispatched to Lazada, with the latest co-president of the unit leaving in January after less than 18 months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some Alibaba executives sent to Lazada have the natural tendency of pushing things the Alibaba way because it proved right in China,&rdquo; said Jianggan Li, the founder of Singapore-based tech investment firm Momentum Works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many tend not to have enough respect for the market, and patience to understand the market deeply,&rdquo; he said, adding that Alibaba&rsquo;s international efforts were still in their early days and the tech giant probably had the determination to learn from mistakes.</p>
<p>Alibaba declined to comment on issues at Lazada for this article.</p>
<p>PUSHBACK</p>
<p>The sources told Reuters many employees had raised their concerns to managers via meetings, emails and messages on DingTalk, an app developed by Alibaba that enables managers to keep constant tabs on staff.</p>
<p>The request that employees at Singapore headquarters wear masks resulted in many queries as it runs counter to guidance from Singapore authorities who recommend masks only if feeling unwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are confused. If they think working in the office is that dangerous, they should&rsquo;ve asked us to work from home,&rdquo; one employee told Reuters.</p>
<p>There were also suggestions from Chinese managers about asking employees to reduce social activities, including religious gatherings, though those steps were not implemented in the face of employee resistance, the sources said.</p>
<p>The pushback has resulted in some changes, as some countries where Lazada operates, such as the Philippines, have stricter privacy laws than China. On March 10, Lazada added a paragraph on privacy protection to the terms of its health check-in program.</p>

<h3 id="pinduoduo-employees-say-alibaba-blocked-personal-accounts--technode">Pinduoduo employees say Alibaba blocked personal accounts · TechNode</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-09-at-16.23.34.png?fit=1730%2C880&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Employees of social e-commerce platform Pinduoduo have accused Alibaba of blocking their personal Taobao accounts as well as those belonging to family members in an open letter posted on Chinese microblogging site Weibo on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Relations between Chinese e-commerce apps are growing more contentious as growth slows and competition intensifies. The issue of “forced exclusivity,” a practice where platforms force sellers or users to use only their platform or services, has been a common complaint among industry players.</p>
<p>China’s market regulators in November reminde d more than 20 e-commerce players that forcing sellers into an exclusive agreement with one marketplace is illegal.</p>
<p>Details: Weibo user “PDD Lefu,” a self-identified customer service manager at Pinduoduo, said in a public letter that several Pinduoduo employees received alerts from their personal Taobao accounts on Wednesday, warning them that the app they are using are not accessible until March 28.</p>
<p>PDD Lefu said in the letter that this was an extension of Alibaba’s “forced exclusivity,” targeting Pinduoduo employees individually.</p>
<p>She points out that the block was also affecting employees of Chinese artificial intelligence startup Yitu, which shares IP addresses with Pinduoduo since the two companies are both located in the Jinhongqiao International office building in Shanghai.</p>
<p>‘You wouldn’t know until you try. IPs at my company Tenga were also blocked. Is it because we are located in the same building?” (our translation) another Weibo user, “Malanshandeshan,” said in a comment on PDD Lefu’s post.</p>
<p>Users on Zhihu, a Quora-like query platform, said in a post that Pinduoduo staff, current and former, have been blocked from certain services on another Alibaba platform, Juhuasuan, including promotional discounts and coupons.</p>
<p>Juhuasuan responded in a post on Weibo that the platform is open to all users, but “says no” to all kinds of unruly practices. It confirmed that it blocked certain users to curb unscrupulous and disruptive practices on the platform.</p>
<p>Juhuasuan said in the post that it had spotted a group of web crawlers and discount scams under the disguise of regular users two years ago. They usually feature unclear identification and a similar registration location.</p>
<p>Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Context: Pinduoduo and its rival Alibaba have been in a years-long public spat over the subject of “forced exclusivity.”
