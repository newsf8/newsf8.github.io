<p>Last week, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe addressed the possibility of a total lockdown saying it would depend on a number of issues.</p>
<p>Having previously stated that a lockdown was an option on the table, Kagwe said that the National Emergency Committee would initiate a lockdown if they were advised to do so by a team of experts currently tracking the cases and creating models based on likely scenarios.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will come to that point when the NEC has determined. We are not working by ourselves. We have got a very strong team of experts in this area, who are modeling,” said CS Kagwe.</p>

<h3 id="no-possibility-of-lockdown-in-kenya---oguna">No possibility of lockdown in Kenya - Oguna</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1hGOLoBPUcmWy7KNltYvTkR3yKEaGPxjghFd-M6G1_3BDqxpU1I1jlJALMbw5FqcadODUQuHzoAMcW8CdVdSeeQirg4V=s1000" alt="img">
The government has dismissed claims of a possible lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna on Wednesday said the stories doing the rounds on social media are misleading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is information on social media of a possible lockdown in Kenya. The information is false, misinforming and causing panic. Don’t consume such content whose source can’t be verified,&rdquo; Oguna said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He asked Kenyans to remain calm and only rely on information from the right sources which is the Ministry of Health or himself.</p>
<p>For the better part of the week, there has been speculation on social media that President Uhuru Kenyatta would announce a total lockdown as the confirmed Covid-19 cases continued to rise.</p>
<p>The number of coronavirus cases in the country now stands at 25 since the last update on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nine new cases were recorded within 24 hours from tests carried out on 82 suspected cases.</p>
<p>The tests were done at the National Influenza Centre, Kemri Nairobi, Kemri Kilifi and Aga Khan University Hospital.</p>
<p>Globally, at least 440,145 people have tested positive for the virus which has claimed 19,751 lives.

<p>Madrid, Spain, Mar 25 – More than three billion people around the world were living under lockdown on Wednesday as governments stepped up their efforts against the coronavirus pandemic which has left more than 20,000 people dead.</p>
<p>As the number of confirmed cases worldwide soared past 450,000, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that only a concerted global effort could stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>In Spain, the number of fatalities surpassed those of China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged three months ago, making it the hardest-hit nation after Italy.</p>
<p>A total of more than 20,800 deaths have now been reported in 182 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally.</p>
<p>Stock markets rebounded after the US Congress moved closer to passing a $2.2 trillion relief package to prop up a teetering US economy.</p>
<p>In Washington, President Donald Trump said New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak with over 30,000 cases, likely has a few “tough weeks” ahead but he would decide soon whether unaffected parts of the country can get back to work.</p>
<p>“We want to get our country going again,” Trump said. “I’m not going to do anything rash or hastily.</p>
<p>“By Easter we’ll have a recommendation and maybe before Easter,” said Trump, who had been touting a strong US economy as he faces an election in November.</p>
<p>UN chief Guterres said the world needs to ban together to stem the pandemic.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 is threatening the whole of humanity — and the whole of humanity must fight back,” Guterres said, launching an appeal for $2 billion to help the world’s poor.</p>
<p>“Global action and solidarity are crucial,” he said. “Individual country responses are not going to be enough.”</p>

<p>– Two deaths in Russia –</p>
<p>India’s stay-at-home order for its 1.3 billion people is now the biggest, taking the total number of individuals facing restrictions on their daily lives to more than three billion.</p>
<p>Anxious Indians raced for supplies after the world’s second-biggest population was ordered not to leave their houses for three weeks.</p>
<p>Russia, which announced the death of two patients who tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, is expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin declared next week a public holiday and postponed a public vote on controversial constitutional reforms, urging people to follow instructions given by authorities.</p>
<p>In Britain, heir to the throne Prince Charles became the latest high-profile figure to be infected, though he has suffered only mild symptoms.</p>
<p>The G20 major economies will hold an emergency videoconference on Thursday to discuss a global response to the crisis, as will the 27 leaders of the European Union, the outbreak’s new epicenter.</p>
<p>China has begun to relax its own draconian restrictions on free movement in the province of Hubei — where the outbreak began in December — after the country reported no new cases.</p>
<p>Crowds jammed trains and buses in the province as people took their first opportunity to travel.</p>
<p>But Spain saw the number of deaths surge to more than 3,400 after 738 people died in the past 24 hours and the government announced a 432-million-euro ($467 million) deal to buy medical supplies from Beijing.</p>
<p>The death toll in Italy jumped in 24 hours by 683 to 7,503 — by far the highest of any country.</p>
<p>Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.</p>
<p>The number of French deaths was up by 231 on Wednesday to more than 1,330, and metro and rail services in Paris were cut to a minimum.</p>
<p>Spain and Italy were joined by France and six more EU countries in urging Germany and the Netherlands to allow the issue of joint European bonds to cut borrowing costs and stabilise the eurozone economy.</p>
<p>The call is likely to fall on deaf ears when EU leaders talk on Thursday — with northern members wary of pooling debt with big spenders — but they will sign off on an “unprecedented” recovery plan.</p>
<p>– ‘People dying alone’ –</p>
<p>At La Paz University Hospital in Madrid, nurse Guillen del Barrio sounded bereft as he related what happened overnight.</p>
<p>“It is really hard, we had feverish people for many hours in the waiting room,” the 30-year-old told AFP.</p>
<p>“Many of my colleagues were crying because there were people who are dying alone, without seeing their family for the last time.”</p>
<p>Coronavirus cases are also spreading in the Middle East, where Iran’s death toll topped 2,000, and in Africa, where Mali declared its first case and several nations announced states of emergency.</p>
<p>In Japan, which has postponed this year’s Olympic Games, Tokyo’s governor urged residents to stay home this weekend, warning of a possible “explosion” of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, believed by Christians to house Christ’s tomb, was shut as Israel tightened movement restrictions.</p>
<p>The impact of the pandemic is also hitting European football, with leagues and tournaments cancelled, while the fate of the Wimbledon tennis tournament could be decided next week.</p>
<p>The economic damage of the virus — and the lockdowns — could also be devastating, with fears of a worldwide recession worse than the financial meltdown more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>But financial markets rose after US leaders reached agreement on a stimulus package worth roughly 10 percent of the US economy, an injection Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said represented a “wartime level of investment.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than half of all Americans have been told to stay at home, including residents of the largest state, California.</p>
<p>The United States has at least 65,700 cases and 942 people have died.</p>
