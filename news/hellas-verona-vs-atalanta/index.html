<p>Atalanta dropped points for only the second time since the season&rsquo;s restart after they were held to a 1-1 draw at Hellas Verona on Saturday.</p>
<p>Atalanta, who drew 2-2 with Serie A leaders Juventus last weekend, are tied on 71 points with second-placed Inter Milan, who play away at AS Roma on Sunday, and six points behind Juve who also have a game in hand.</p>

</ul>
<p>Duvan Zapata gave Atalanta the lead when he forced Koray Guenter into an error five minutes into the second half. Despite the defender&rsquo;s best efforts to deny Zapata a run on goal, the Colombian striker calmly slotted the ball past Marco Silvestri.</p>
<p>Verona responded nine minutes later when Matteo Pessina, on loan from Atalanta, made a late run into the box to pounce on Pierluigi Gollini&rsquo;s parry and fire home emphatically his fourth goal since the restart and seventh of the season.</p>
<p>Atalanta, who would have wrapped up Champions League qualification with victory, nearly took all three points in stoppage time when Mario Pasalic&rsquo;s effort from a cross went inches wide of the post.

Atalanta&rsquo;s Duvan Zapata (2-R) scored in their draw with Verona in the Italian Serie A</p>
<p>Atalanta&rsquo;s push for second spot in Italy&rsquo;s Serie A was hampered by a 1-1 draw at Verona in Serie A on Saturday while AC Milan scored five times in a crushing win over Bologna.</p>
<p>Duvan Zapata took advantage of a mistake to give Atalanta the lead in the 50th minute but Matteo Pessina - who is on loan from the Bergamaschi - levelled for Verona nine minutes later.</p>
<p>Atalanta took the lead five minutes into the second half through Duvan Zapata but Verona were back on level terms shortly after when Matteo Pessina equalised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have our chances to get into the next Champions League,&rdquo; Atalanta boss Gian Piero Gasperini said after his side&rsquo;s round 34 match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need one point and I don&rsquo;t think Roma will win them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Atalanta are on 71 points and level with second-place Inter Milan, who visit fifth-placed Roma - 57 points - on Sunday.</p>
<p>Italian league leaders Juventus have a six-point advantage and host fourth-place Lazio on Monday.</p>
<p>An emphatic AC Milan performance resulted in a 5-1 humiliation of Bologna 5-1 to strengthen their chances of qualifying for the Europa League.</p>
<p>Milan are sixth, three points above Napoli who have already qualified for the Europa League as Italian Cup winners.</p>
<p>Alexis Saelemaekers and Ismael Bennacer scored their first goals for Milan while Takehiro Tomiyasu replied for Bologna on the stroke of halftime.</p>
<p>Ismael Bennacer restored Milan&rsquo;s two-goal advantage four minutes after the break and Zlatan Ibrahimovic set up Ante Rebic for the fourth eight minutes later.</p>
<p>Davide Calabria sealed a great night for the Rossoneri in stoppage time.</p>
<p>Eighth-placed Sassuolo dominated but could only manage a 1-1 draw at 10-man Cagliari, who scored for the first time in five matches.</p>
<p>The visitors created plenty of chances but managed a lone goal courtesy of Francesco Caputo&rsquo;s 12th-minute header.</p>
<p>Cagliari had to play most of the second half a man down after defender Andrea Carboni was shown a second yellow card and sent off just three minutes after the break.</p>
<p>However, Joao Pedro equalised against the run of play on 63 minutes to end mid-table Cagliari&rsquo;s goalless streak of 467 minutes.

MILAN (AP) &ndash; Atalanta’s push for second spot was hampered by a 1-1 draw at Hellas Verona in Serie A on Saturday.</p>
<p>Duván Zapata took advantage of a mistake to give Atalanta the lead in the 50th minute but Matteo Pessina - who is on loan from Atalanta - leveled nine minutes later.</p>
<p>The result left Atalanta level on 71 points with second-place Inter Milan, which visits Roma on Sunday. Italian league leader Juventus has a six-point advantage and hosts fourth-place Lazio on Monday.</p>
<p>“In the whole of the second half of the season, we’ve been going at a rhythm worthy of title winners, if every once in a while we get two draws that’s fine, these aren’t the games to have regrets over,” Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini said.</p>
<p>“The title isn’t our aim at the moment, because to make it possible something extraordinary has to happen, for us but also for Juventus. It’s over the first half of the season that we can have regrets.”</p>
<p>Atalanta had won 11 of its last 13 league games - drawing the other two - and beat Brescia 6-2 midweek but it struggled to break Verona down.</p>
<p>Atalanta eventually broke the deadlock five minutes into the second half when Koray Günter lost the ball and Zapata rushed in, used his strength to hold off the Verona defender, and fired into the bottom corner.</p>
<p>It was Zapata’s third goal in as many matches.</p>
<p>But Verona was back on level terms shortly after when Atalanta goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini could only parry Amir Rrahmani’s strike and Pessina fired in the rebound.</p>
<p>Mario Pašalić almost won it for Atalanta in stoppage time but volleyed a cross inches wide of the left post.</p>
<p>DOMINANT MILAN</p>
<p>An emphatic AC Milan performance saw it humiliate Bologna 5-1 to strengthen its chances of qualifying for the Europa League.</p>
<p>Alexis Saelemaekers and Ismaël Bennacer both scored their first goals for Milan and Takehiro Tomiyasu did so for Bologna.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Milan moved into sixth, three points above Napoli, which hosts relegation-threatened Udinese on Sunday.</p>
<p>Milan dominated from the start and should have scored more. It took the lead in the 10th minute when Theo Hernández ran onto Ante Rebić’s backheeled flick and pulled the ball back for Saelemaekers to slot home.</p>
<p>Bologna gifted Milan the second as goalkeeper Łukasz Skorupski could only kick Riccardo Orsolini&rsquo;s poor back pass straight at Hakan Çalhanoğlu, who thumped it into the roof of the net.</p>
<p>Franck Kessié hit the post for Milan before Tomiyasu pulled one back for Bologna on the stroke of halftime with a stunning strike into the top right corner.</p>
<p>But Bennacer restored Milan’s two-goal advantage four minutes after the break and Zlatan Ibrahimović set up Rebić for the fourth eight minutes later.</p>
<p>Davide Calabria sealed a great night for Milan in stoppage time.</p>
<p>GOALLESS STREAK ENDED</p>
<p>Sassuolo dominated but could only manage a 1-1 draw at 10-man Cagliari, which scored for the first time in five matches.</p>
<p>The visitors created plenty of chances but put only one of them away when Francesco Caputo was left unmarked to head in at the back post after a corner was deflected toward him in the 12th minute.</p>
<p>Cagliari had to play most of the second half with 10 men after defender Andrea Carboni was shown a second yellow card and sent off just three minutes after the break.</p>
<p>However, João Pedro equalized against the run of play following a one-two with Marko Rog.</p>
<p>It ended Cagliari&rsquo;s goalless streak of 467 minutes.</p>

Atalanta go second in Serie A</p>
<p>CHASING JUVENTUS: Atalanta are having one of the best seasons in their 112-year history, with a berth in the Champions League quarter-finals in their debut season</p>
<p>AFP, MILAN, Italy</p>
<p>Mario Pasalic on Tuesday scored a hat-trick as Atalanta BC brushed aside struggling local rivals Brescia 6-2 to move into second place in Serie A.</p>
<p>Gian Piero Gasperini’s side extended their unbeaten league run to 13 games to move six points behind leaders Juventus, who yesterday visited eighth-placed US Sassuolo.</p>
<p>Inter and SS Lazio are two points behind Atalanta before they play against SPAL and Udinese respectively later this week.</p>

<p>Gasperini’s side have scored 93 league goals so far this season — 26 more than eight-time reigning champions Juventus.</p>
<p>“We don’t do it to humiliate the opponent, but we try to play our game,” Gasperini said. “Already last year we were the best attack in the league. This year, we have surpassed ourselves, scoring many goals with many different players.”</p>
<p>“Playing in the Champions League has helped us and made us grow,” added Gasperini, whose side is to play Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight next month. “We are preparing for Paris Saint-Germain, but also want to fight to the end in Serie A. I think the best way to be ready for Aug. 12 will be to play these last five league games to the maximum.”</p>
<p>The game between high-scoring Atalanta and 19th-placed Brescia was one between two neighboring teams from cities ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A minute’s silence took place before kick-off with players forming a circle with the music Rinascero, Rinascerai (I Will Be Reborn, You Will Be Reborn) by Bergamo musician Roby Facchinetti playing in the background.</p>
<p>Atalanta’s top scorer, Luis Muriel, with 17 league goals this season, watched from the stands just hours after the Colombian had left the hospital after suffering a head injury in a fall at his home.</p>
<p>However, his absence was not felt with Croatian Pasalic opening the scoring within two minutes at the Gewiss Stadium connecting with a Ruslan Malinovskyi cross.</p>
<p>Brescia hit back minutes later with Ernesto Torregrossa pouncing on Atalanta defender Mattia Caldara’s poor clearance.</p>
<p>However, the hosts got their stride back and were four goals up after half an hour with Marten De Roon, Malinovskyi and a Duvan Zapata header within five minutes.</p>
<p>The punishment continued in the second half with Malinovskyi again setting up Pasalic to beat Lorenzo Andrenacci in the Brescia goal after 55 minutes.</p>
<p>The Croatian added a third three minutes later, sending in Ebrima Colley’s cross for his ninth goal of the season, five of them against Brescia, having scored a brace in the away leg in November last year.</p>
<p>“It’s the best moment of my career,” Pasalic said after his maiden hat-trick. “There are still five games left and we can do even better. We have scored more than 90 goals in Serie A. We have shown against Juventus [2-2 draw] that we can match even the strongest teams.”</p>
<p>Nikolas Spalek pulled a goal back for Brescia, who move closer to Serie B next season.</p>
<p>However, Atalanta are having one of the best seasons in the club’s 112-year history, with a berth in the Champions League quarter-finals in their debut season.

Gasp: &lsquo;Verona similar to my Atalanta&rsquo;</p>
<p>By Football Italia staff</p>
<p>Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini has claimed Hellas Verona coach Ivan Juric shares his approach, as La Dea aim to confirm their place in the Champions League on Saturday.</p>
<p>Speakin to the Nerazzurri&rsquo;s official channel, Gasperini focused mainly on claiming the two points remaining to confirm their place in the European Cup next season.</p>
<p>“Two points are missing to secure qualification for the Champions League,” he told the club’s official website. “When we have reached one target, we add another. It’s good, it’s important to always set goals. Let’s move forward.</p>
<p>“There are five games remaining and the programme is difficult for everyone. It should be a good battle, also to keep up the motivations and prepare us for the Champions League.”</p>
<p>Atalanta have done will to utilise the whole squad and Gasperini is happy to be able to count on every single player at his disposal.</p>
<p>“It has been satisfying, everyone has played well and it therefore allowed me to rotate,” he added. “Some players have recovered physically; in the long run it can be tiring to play every three days.”</p>
<p>Atalanta can’t stop scoring this term, with Duvan Zapata, Luis Muriel and Josip Ilicic all on double digits in Serie A, whilst Mario Pasalic and Robin Gosens can join them if they add another to their tally against Verona.</p>
<p>“It’s part of the stats of a season with many records, we know them too. It’s a great pleasure but the priority is to continue expressing ourselves and play this way in order to get the most from it.”</p>
<p>But Gasp is wary of high-flying Verona, who sit ninth under the guidance of Juric this season.</p>
<p>“Hellas were in the running for seventh, I would say deservedly so. I think they’re the revelation this season, also because of the style of play they have developed.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, it will be a difficult game for us, just like the reverse fixture was. It will be an excellent test, a game with intensity. That’s something we don’t always find in this period.”</p>
<p>The match will be played at 16:15 UK time and Gasperini joked it was to test them further.</p>
<p>“To increase the level of difficulty,” he laughed. “Sometimes we need to play these kinds of games. It will be a thrilling game.”</p>
<p>Luis Muriel watched from the stands after having suffered a head injury prior to the match against Brescia and Gasp confirmed he’s back in contention on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Muriel is fine, he has been training. He might be available, right now we are all ready, apart from Ilicic. We are trying to recover him in the best way from a physical point of view.”</p>
<p>The 62-year-old went on to claim that his former player Juric share similar ideas to Orobici for his Verona.</p>
<p>“There are similarities in the interpretation of the games. Juric was my player, but also my collaborator.</p>
<p>“We spent a lifetime together and shared a lot from Crotone to Genoa. Now, he has reached his levels, he won a historic championship in Crotone.</p>
<p>“It’s happening again this year, he had a hole with Genoa, but it wasn’t easy there. I’m sorry about that. We will take a nice picture together.”</p>

<p>Atalanta&rsquo;s push for second spot in Italy&rsquo;s Serie A was hampered by a 1-1 draw at Verona in Serie A on Saturday while AC Milan scored five times in a crushing win over Bologna. Duvan Zapata took advantage of a mistake to give Atalanta the lead in the 50th minute but Matteo Pessina - who is on loan from the Bergamaschi - levelled for Verona nine minutes later. Atalanta took the lead five minutes into the second half through Duvan Zapata but Verona were back on level terms shortly after when Matteo Pessina equalised. &ldquo;We still have our chances to get into the next Champions League,&rdquo; Atalanta boss Gian Piero Gasperini said after his side&rsquo;s round 34 match. &ldquo;We need one point and I don&rsquo;t think Roma will win them all.&rdquo; Atalanta are on 71 points and level with second-place Inter Milan, who visit fifth-placed Roma - 57 points - on Sunday. Italian league leaders Juventus have a six-point advantage and host fourth-place Lazio on Monday. An emphatic AC Milan performance resulted in a 5-1 humiliation of Bologna 5-1 to strengthen their chances of qualifying for the Europa League. Milan are sixth, three points above Napoli who have already qualified for the Europa League as Italian Cup winners. Alexis Saelemaekers and Ismael Bennacer scored their first goals for Milan while Takehiro Tomiyasu replied for Bologna on the stroke of halftime. Ismael Bennacer restored Milan&rsquo;s two-goal advantage four minutes after the break and Zlatan Ibrahimovic set up Ante Rebic for the fourth eight minutes later. Davide Calabria sealed a great night for the Rossoneri in stoppage time. Eighth-placed Sassuolo dominated but could only manage a 1-1 draw at 10-man Cagliari, who scored for the first time in five matches. The visitors created plenty of chances but managed a lone goal courtesy of Francesco Caputo&rsquo;s 12th-minute header. Cagliari had to play most of the second half a man down after defender Andrea Carboni was shown a second yellow card and sent off just three minutes after the break. However, Joao Pedro equalised against the run of play on 63 minutes to end mid-table Cagliari&rsquo;s goalless streak of 467 minutes. Australian Associated Press</p>

<h3 id="atalanta-only-the-beginning">&ldquo;Atalanta only the beginning&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.football-italia.net/sites/all/themes/italia/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Italian football has this reputation for being boring, defensive, entirely dominated by one team and the others all simply roll over for them. None of that is true in 2020. Well, alright, so Juventus are on track for a ninth consecutive title, but even here it’s far from a comfortable victory parade. Atalanta, Sassuolo, Hellas Verona, even Bologna and Lecce, are all part of the new breed of Serie A club. Unapologetically provincial, but with the mindset of a potential giant. It’s like Zdenek Zeman’s Foggia spawned children without the laissez-faire attitude to defending and copious cigarettes.</p>
<p>So much used to be made of ‘respect’ in Calcio. There were all these unwritten rules about not going beyond 4-0, as it was belittling your opponent when they were already beaten. You had to respect the big clubs like Juve, accept your role of sparring partner and hope to grab a point by defending stoically against the inevitable onslaught. That simply isn’t the case anymore and Gian Piero Gasperini’s Atalanta are just at the forefront of this movement, by no means the only ones. They are grabbing the headlines after setting up a Champions League quarter-final with Paris Saint-Germain and securing their status in the competition for next season, too.</p>
<p>La Dea are shattering scoring records as well as opposition defences, netting at least six in four different matches, a record in Europe’s top five leagues this season. The only other Serie A team in the last 60 years to have reached 93 goals in a campaign was Napoli with 94 in 2016-17, but they are on track to comfortably crush a Century. The last Italian top flight team to score 93 goals after 33 rounds was Milan on 101 in 1950-51, which was before Gasperini had even been born. These are historic figures and worthy of celebration, so it’s no wonder they are inspiring others.</p>
<p>The most direct inspiration, of course, is Ivan Juric, who was Gasperini’s player at Genoa and later his assistant manager. Hellas Verona don’t always get it right, but they have the same approach as Atalanta and it has put this newly-promoted club mid-table. If they had some better centre-forward options available, they could easily have challenged for a Europa League place.</p>
<p>Juric summed up the new Italian approach after the 2-2 draw with Inter. “I don’t like being defensive, getting increasingly pinned back and crushed. I get bored and irritated. I honestly prefer to risk a heavy defeat than play like that.” I am so glad that Hellas replaced their city rivals Chievo Verona in the top flight this season, because the former darlings of the neutrals had become a painful carbuncle of Calcio, forever just happy to be one point above the relegation zone, even if it meant only really trying in the games against those around them in the table. Good riddance to Donkeys treading water.</p>
<p>Sassuolo have just extended Roberto De Zerbi’s contract and this makes them absolutely the team to watch next season. They’ve got more of a Zeman style about them at the moment, as shown by three different 3-3 draws against Inter, Verona and Juventus since the restart alone, but they’re still at the early stages of the project. This is where Atalanta were a couple of years ago and, like the Bergamo boys, this is a provincial club with smart economic principles and a bold vision.</p>
<p>Let the defend and counter brigade go down, bring up the record-breaking Benevento and make Serie A the home of spectacular, attacking football. The more Atalanta succeed, the more they will inspire others to follow suit. It’s already happening with Bologna and even Lecce, who I really hope don’t get relegated, as Fabio Liverani at least does try to take the game to the big clubs and play good football, even if it’s usually undone by poor finishing and defensive errors. If you’re going to go down, at least go with a fight, an identity and respect above all for yourself rather than the over-rated opposition. Mark my words, Atalanta are just the beginning.</p>
