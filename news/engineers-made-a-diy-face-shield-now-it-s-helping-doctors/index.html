Early last week, Lennon Rodgers, director of the Engineering Design Innovation Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison, got an urgent email from the university’s hospital. Could his lab make 1,000 face shields to protect staff testing and treating Covid-19 patients? The hospital’s usual suppliers were out of stock, due to the spike in demand prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>After putting his kids to bed, Rodgers went to Home Depot and a local craft store and grabbed supplies, including transparent plastic and a couple of foam mannequin heads. Then he made a hasty prototype at the UW maker space by adapting a construction visor and presented it to his wife, an anesthesiologist. “I was really proud of it, but she put it on and said ‘This is way too heavy,’” Rodgers recalls.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Rodgers devised several lighter prototypes with two friends: Jesse Darley, a mechanical engineer at design firm Delve, and Brian Ellison, business development manager at manufacturer Midwest Prototyping. Rodgers’ wife provided more feedback, and talked the group through infection-control videos showing how to put on and remove face shields.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the hospital approved the prototype. Rodgers posted the design online for others to use and the ad hoc collective began to ramp up production. They have since sent more than than 1,000 face shields to the UW Hospital. Ford has picked up the open source design, and expects to produce more than 75,000 this week at subsidiary Troy Design and Manufacturing in Plymouth, Michigan. The company plans to send the initial run to Detroit area hospitals.</p>
<p>Shortages of face masks, ventilators, and other medical equipment needed to care for Covid-19 patients and reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus have inspired engineers, makers, and hobbyists around the world. The Madison face shield, dubbed the Badger Shield, is one of the first to bloom into medically approved, mass-scale production.</p>
<p>“We’re filling a niche while the high-volume supply chains have broken down,” says Darley, who took the lead on design and authored the open source technical drawings picked up by Ford. If other manufacturers adopt the design, he adds, “I think we can ramp up production very quickly.”</p>

<p>Medical staff wear face shields over face masks while treating patients to protect against flying respiratory droplets that can transmit coronavirus, such as from coughs and sneezes. Bob Scheuer, director of materials management at UW Health, says protective equipment of all kinds has become hard to find, but face shields are especially critical because staff now wear them routinely.</p>
<p>Scheuer notes that staff disinfect masks between patients and reuse them, but they have to be replaced periodically due to wear and tear. The hospital in Madison doesn’t yet have a rush of Covid-19 patients, but preventing coronavirus spreading to staff is crucial. “It’s a downward spiral if we can’t keep them safe,” he says. “So far these new shields are working well for us.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;Infection Control Approved&rsquo;</p>
<p>Darley says engineers would typically huddle together over tools and materials to brainstorm on a new product, but social distancing prevented it on this project. He, Rodgers, and Ellison, who knew each other from design events in Madison, collaborated mostly over phone, FaceTime, text, and Google’s photo-sharing service. “It would have been much easier if we could have met in person,” Darley adds. They placed an order for overnight delivery of items from hardware supplier McMaster-Carr, which donated some materials.</p>
<p>The design work really came together, Darley says, after he contacted a hospital worker he knew from the local dog park and she brought him a face shield that he could measure and disassemble. To make more shields, it first was necessary to destroy one. “The biggest impression was how lightweight it was. It’s featherlight.”

<h3 id="coronavirus-in-colorado-how-to-make-a-face-shield-at-home">Coronavirus In Colorado: How To Make A Face Shield At Home</h3>
<p><img src="https://denver.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909806/2020/03/shield.jpg?w=1500" alt="img"></p>
<p>– A doctor based in Denver has been increasingly worried face masks alone are not enough to protect against the transmission of the coronavirus. She’s found a way to give people an extra layer of protection that nearly anyone can make at home.</p>
<p>Dr. Stacey Folk is a plastic surgeon at Folk Plastic Surgery. She told CBS4 sometimes it’s hard for people to cough into their elbow in time, or cover their mouths. That’s why she began looking into face shields.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is something earth shattering, that everybody needs to make a face shield, but if you are someone that touches your face a lot, if you are going to be a situation like maybe in the store where you will be really close to people standing in line, this might be that reminder not to bring your hands up to your face and if someone accidentally coughs or sneezes right next to you and right at you, it might give you a little bit of protection,” Folk said.</p>
<p>All that’s required to make this yourself is a clear 2-liter soda bottle, string, and scissors. A hole puncher is optional.</p>
<p>Folk’s first direction is to cut out the plastic from the middle of the bottle, then adjust the size to fit your head. Once you’re done with measurements, she said to mark and punch through the corners and run a string through, possibly shoelaces if available.</p>
<p>It may not seem like much, but if this is worn over a face mask, Folk said it could help shield from respiratory droplets, that’s what comes out when people cough or sneeze, and that’s what causes the spread of infection.</p>
<p>“Most primary care offices don’t have splash guards, there’s not a need for them, but in this environment, they might want to be wearing something like that over their mask. People that work in food service, that work in drive-thrus, they want to protect themselves a little bit more than they would and you can’t just order these right now. There’s a huge backlog.”</p>
<p>While she hopes perhaps a local manufacturing company will consider helping to produce and donate more face shields like these to health care workers, anyone who wants to make these at home could benefit to protect against COVID-19.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.dailyhive.com/20200326140431/vgh-face-shield-500x258.jpg" alt="img">
Take part in the war effort against COVID-19 from your home or your place of work; a Vancouver-based architectural visualization company is turning on their 3D printers to mass produce face shields for healthcare workers.</p>
<p>LNG Studios is seeking help to continue its production of face shields, and it is also providing anyone who owns a 3D printer with necessary know-how to do the same.</p>
<p>Currently, as known cases of the coronavirus soar, there is a significant shortage of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) supplies, and this includes face shields that protect workers from being infected by respiratory droplets from a patient coughing or sneezing.</p>
<p>“We are very low on equipment, everyone at Vancouver General Hospital has to wear a mask and face shield. These face shields are needed more than ever because they can be reused,” said Leonel Leyson, a registered nurse for intensive care unit patients at Vancouver General Hospital, in a statement.</p>
<p>Currently, the company’s five 3D printing machines have the capacity to print up to 60 units of face shields per day, but this is certainly far from enough given the soaring demand.</p>
<p>During Monday’s provincial health press conference, officials also noted they are now using medical supplies far more quickly than anticipated. There is now an urgency to source frontline workers with the necessary equipment they need in advance of the expected surge in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>The type of face shield being printed by LNG Studios is based on a verified open source design available from PRUSA. They have partnered with five Metro Vancouver hospitals — Richmond Hospital, Vancouver General Hospital, St. Pauls Hospital, Lions Gate Hospital and Surrey Memorial Hospital — who have all already tested the prototypes and are now waiting for these supplies.</p>
<p>These face shields consist of a reusable visor with extra face shields, effectively extending the lifespan of a single visor by simply replacing the face shields.</p>
<p>Plastic materials for the equipment have already been sourced from local suppliers, which are supplying and laser cutting acrylic sheets to specifications.</p>
<p>“This is a time where coming together with innovative ideas matters most. In this case, time is of the essence and we are arming our local frontline health workers with face shields that will protect them in the line of duty,” said Leon Ng, CEO and founder of LNG Studios.</p>
<p>“We’re calling on all 3D printers, innovators and creators to join us in this effort and help close the gap on the need for PPE across BC.”</p>
<p>For LNG Studios’ production, Ng says they have secured funding from local developer Gryphon Developments to produce the first batch of 100 face shields, with two extra replacement clear acrylic sheets per face shield.</p>
<p>Each batch costs $2,000, and they are looking for additional monetary support, with donations accepted through the GoFundMe crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>Anyone who would like to receive the design file and printing instructions for the face shield, as well as connections with the network of local hospitals, should email [email protected].
