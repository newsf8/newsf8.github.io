You may know Ana de Armas as the actress recently spotted getting friendly with Deep Water co-star Ben Affleck. Indeed, these two have been a rumored item for months now, and their recent PDA only confirms what we’ve long suspected, with a source telling People the duo is “definitely dating.” But de Armas is hardly an unknown. The actress charmed the world with her star turn in 2019’s Knives Out, and has upcoming roles in the new James Bond film, a Marilyn Monroe biopic, and more. So, who is Ana de Armas, the beguiling actress and maybe-boo of Ben Affleck? Here’s everything you need to know about the rising star.

She Was Born in Cuba

The 31-year-old star was born and raised in Cuba, and owns a house in Havana to this day. When she goes, she told Vanity Fair that her “suitcases go full of clothing or medicine or supplies — whatever people need — and come back empty.” Her mother works in human resources and her father is a teacher.

She Starred in Her First American Film in 2015

Only five years ago, de Armas had her first role in an American film, Knock Knock. Roles in Hands of Stone and War Dogs quickly followed, and her star rose even further with her performance in 2017’s Blade Runner 2049.

She Learned English in Four Months

De Armas had success in Madrid as an actress before moving to Hollywood, and says her grasp on English was still a bit fuzzy during her early roles. “The first time I read for a part, I had no clue what ‘I beg your pardon’ was,” she told Vanity Fair. “I thought it was really angry, like ‘I beg your pardon!’ Like I am going to take your pardon. And every person in the room was like, ‘She has no clue what she’s saying right now.’ But the thing is, I knew exactly what was happening in the scene. It was a crazy combination of ‘She has no clue’ and ‘She’s doing it.'”

De Armas picked up the language quickly after that: “People ask, ‘How did you learn English so quickly?’ I’m like, ‘Because my life depended on it.'”

She’s Already Been Nominated for a Golden Globe

Her performance in Knives Out earned her a Best Actress — Motion Picture Comedy or Musical nomination at the 2020 awards.

Her ‘Bond Girl’ Role Was Written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge

Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge played a part in writing de Armas’ “Bond Girl” character, after Daniel Craig and director Cary Joji Fukunaga all but begged her to take the part. “You could also tell that Phoebe was in there,” de Armas told Vanity Fair of the role. “There was that humor and spikiness so specific to her. My character feels like a real woman.”

She’s Playing Marilyn Monroe in an Upcoming Biopic

Ana de Armas is playing Marilyn Monroe in Blonde, due out in 2020. “I remember when she showed me a video of her screen tests for Blonde,” Knives Out co-star Jamie Lee Curtis recounts. “I dropped to the floor. I couldn’t believe it. Ana was completely gone. She was Marilyn.”

She’s Been Married Once Before

The actress was married to Spanish actor Marc Clotet from 2011 to 2013. She’s also previously been linked to talent agent Franklin Latt, and artist Alejandro Piñeiro Bello.

She Loves Her Dog Elvis

In fact, Elvis will be joining her in Blonde, playing Marilyn Monroe’s dog.

She’s Been Spotted with Affleck Since December

Affleck and de Armas have had rumors swirling around their relationship since winter of last year, with a source telling Life & Style in November that their “chemistry is off the charts.” The source added: “They hit it off when they first met about the movie, and things have really heated up since they started working side by side. Ana admired Ben’s work, but she had no idea how smart, engaging and handsome he was in person. She’s definitely smitten, and so is he.”

We’re sure we’ll be hearing more about the star in the coming weeks — for now, we’re just on the edge of our seats about whether Affleck and de Armas are the real deal.
