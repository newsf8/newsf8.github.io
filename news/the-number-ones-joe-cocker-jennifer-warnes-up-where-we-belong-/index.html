<p>In The Number Ones, I’m reviewing every single #1 single in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, starting with the chart’s beginning, in 1958, and working my way up into the present.</p>
<hr>
<p>Joe Cocker &amp; Jennifer Warnes – “Up Where We Belong”</p>
<p>HIT #1: November 6, 1982</p>
<p>STAYED AT #1: 3 weeks</p>
<p>In the final moments of An Officer And A Gentleman, Richard Gere struts into the factory, his bright and crispy white uniform stark and vivid against the gray all around him, as the baritone guitars of Jack Nitzsche’s score blare behind him. Gere is Zack Mayo, a dreamer with a fucked-up past and an anti-authority streak that keeps getting him in trouble. He wasn’t supposed to make it through Aviation Officer Candidate School, and he had to get in a damn kung fu fight with his drill instructor to do it. But he made it. He’s Ensign Mayo now.</p>
<p>While Mayo has been struggling his way through the school, he’s fallen in love with Debra Winger’s Paula Pokrifki. Mayo has been warned that the local women in that Pacific Northwest town only care about bagging a Naval aviator. Mayo’s best friend just took his own life after he left the school, proposed to Paula’s best friend, and got rejected. So Mayo, doubting himself, had broken it off with Paula. But now that he’s made it through the school, Gere knows. Walking through that factory, he’s sure of himself, of what he needs to do.</p>
<p>Mayo sneaks up behind Paula, who’s working at some bigass machine. He surprises her, grabs her, kisses her, all while the score swells up behind him. Paula’s best friend, the one who (at least in the movie’s logic) drove Gere’s friend to suicide, looks pissed off at first, but then she cheers for Paula. All the women in the factory cheer as Gere carries Winger out into the final freeze-frame. It’s one of the all-time great movie endings, at least until the score fades into the song.</p>
<p>The song is where it all goes wrong. A watery piano hits a couple of notes, and two voices rise up — one a raspy yarl, the other a sweetly anonymous coo. Together, they sing blank nothings about the power of love while session musicians noodle aimless, canned, quasi-soul. The song they’re singing has the same melody as Jack Nitzsche’s triumphant score, but it transfigures that score into sleepy, character-free waiting-room music. In mere seconds, the song utterly curdles the emotional high of that great final scene. I hate it.</p>
<p>It’s not like “Up Where We Belong” doesn’t have pedigree. Everyone involved in the song had tremendous success in one space or another. Consider co-writer Jack Nitzche, whose score served as the basis for the song. By 1982, Nitzche was a legit legend, albeit one with a disturbing history. Nitzche had moved to Los Angeles in the late ’50s, wanting to become a jazz saxophonist. He’d fallen in with Sonny Bono, and together, they’d written “Needles And Pins” for Jackie DeShannon in 1963. (The highest-charting version of “Needles And Pins,” the Searchers’ 1964 take on the song, peaked at #13.) Nitzche also worked as Phil Spector’s arranger and conductor, and he’d helped design the whole Wall Of Sound aesthetic.</p>
<p>Nitzsche had a hand in a whole lot of great music. He’d played on almost all the best Rolling Stones albums. He’d been in Neil Young’s first Crazy Horse lineup, and he’d also co-produced the first Crazy Horse album. He kept working with Neil Young through the ’70s, playing on many of Young’s classics. In the ’70s, Nitzsche started scoring films, including massively successful and important ones like The Exorcist and One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. Nitzsche also developed a serious drug habit, and in 1979, he was arrested for raping his ex-girlfriend, the actress Carrie Snodgress, with a gun barrel. (The charges were later dropped.)</p>
<p>On the Officer And A Gentleman score, Nitzsche’s main collaborator was the Canadian folk singer and indigenous activist Buffy Sainte-Marie. Sainte-Marie is a legend in her own right, a key participant in the early-’60s folk scene and the writer of the 1963 anti-war standard “Universal Soldier.” (That song has been covered dozens of times, and a couple of mid-’60s versions, from Donovan and Glen Campbell, charted in the US in the mid-’60s.) On a 1977 Sesame Street episode, Sainte-Marie became the first woman ever to breastfeed a baby on American TV. Sainte-Marie and Nitzsche got married in 1982, and they stayed together until Nitzsche died of a heart attack in 2000.</p>
<p>Nitzsche and Sainte-Marie co-wrote the main theme from An Officer And A Gentleman, the piece of music that plays as Gere struts into that factory. When director Taylor Hackford decided that the movie needed a big end-credits song, Paramount head of music Joel Sill brought in the songwriter Will Jennings, whose work will show up in this column again. Jennings stitched together pieces of the score and wrote some lyrics to them, and that became “Up Where We Belong.”</p>
<p>Jennifer Warnes, one of the two voices on “Up Where We Belong,” had come from the California folk scene. She’d been around show business, in one way or another, since the late ’60s, when she’d been a cast member on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour and one of the stars in the LA production of Hair. Warnes was also one of Leonard Cohen’s closest collaborators; she sang backup and did vocal arrangements on many of Cohen’s albums, up to and including 2012’s Old Ideas. The former Velvet Underground member John Cale produced one of Warnes’ solo albums in 1972. And Warnes scored a pop success in 1976, when her single “Right Time Of The Night” peaked at #6. (It’s a 5.)</p>
<p>After “Right Time Of The Night,” Warnes found a niche as a singer of movie themes. On 1979’s Norma Rae soundtrack, Warnes sang “It Goes Like It Goes,” which won a Best Original Song Oscar for writers David Shire and Norman Gimbel. Two years later, Warnes sang the Randy Newman-written “One More Hour” on the Ragtime soundtrack, and that one was nominated for another Oscar. Despite those successes, director Taylor Hackford thought her voice was too sweet for the Officer And A Gentleman soundtrack. So she countered by saying that she could sing it with Joe Cocker, whose voice wasn’t too sweet for anything.</p>
<p>Cocker, the mad-dog Englishman, was famous for being a histrionic blues-rock yowler and a self-destructive alcoholic cautionary tale. Cocker, a Sheffield native, came up through the British rock universe in the late ’60s. Jimmy Page played guitar on Cocker’s breakout single, a 1968 cover of the Beatles “With A Little Help From My Friends,” which only got to #68 in the US but which topped the charts in the UK. A year later, Cocker famously growled and screamed and testified his way through the song at Woodstock. In 1970, Cocker had his first US hit when his cover of “The Letter,” a chart-topper for the Box Tops, peaked at #7. (Cocker’s version is a 7.)</p>
<p>Cocker toured hard through the ’70s, and he also had some pop success, but he visibly struggled with alcoholism. But Cocker got it together enough to give a reportedly-impressive performance with the Crusaders at the 1982 Grammys. (I can’t find it online anywhere.) After that performance, Warnes was confident that Cocker could sing “Up Where We Belong” as a duet with her, even though they’d never met. Cocker took some convincing, but he agreed to record the song, flying to LA mid-tour to record it with Warnes.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: Joe Cocker was a weird choice for this thing. It’s not that Joe Cocker was incapable of singing ballads; he’d gotten to #5 with his 1975 cover of Billy Preston’s “You Are So Beautiful.” (Cocker’s version is an 8.) But Cocker’s raspy, gravelly voice just doesn’t fit with the airless ’80s easy-listening production of “Up Where We Belong.” Cocker’s delivery is almost a parody of churchy Black American soul singing, and he needs space to dip and dive and soar. The antiseptic piano-tinkles and clumsily obvious string arrangements of “Up Where We Belong” don’t give him that space.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, “Up Where We Belong” is just a bad song. It’s a love ballad, but the lyrics are so vague and indistinct that they immediately evaporate into nothingness. The image of love lifting a couple up “where the eagles cry on a mountain high” is memorably stupid, and it should at least be funny. But in all its gloopy anonymity, “Up Where We Belong” won’t even let it be that. Warnes, a total professional, does what she can with the song, but she fades right away. Cocker sounds utterly out of his depth. The song hits with all the force of hot air from a gas-station hand dryer. It’s the worst.</p>
<p>At first, things did not look promising for “Up Where We Belong.” Island Records head Chris Blackwell, Cocker’s label boss, had allowed him to record the song. But when he heard it, Blackwell hated the song so much that Cocker left the label shortly thereafter. Paramount execs Michael Eisner and Don Simpson hated the song, too, and Simpson bet $100 that it wouldn’t be a hit. The track almost got pulled from the soundtrack. When the single came out, some radio stations sent it back to the label.</p>
<p>But An Officer And A Gentleman was a huge hit, and “Up Where We Belong” was featured prominently in it. An Officer And A Gentleman earned $129 million, and it was the #3 movie of 1982 at the domestic box office, behind only E.T. and Tootsie. Eventually, popularity of An Officer And A Gentleman pushed the song. That’s the best explanation I can come up with for its success: People loved that ending scene, and “Up Where We Belong” reminded them of it. Four months after the film hit theaters, the song finally made it to #1.</p>
<p>At the 1983 Oscars, “Up Where We Belong” won Best Original Song — the second time that a Jennifer Warnes-performed song would win the award, and not the last. (Fellow nominee “Eye Of The Tiger” was robbed.) Warnes and a sweaty Cocker sang the song on the telecast, while the dancers around them acted out what looked like a Navy-themed cult staging a mass wedding.</p>
<p>Olivia Newton-John handed the award to Jack Nitzsche, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and Will Jennings. Sainte-Marie became the first indigenous person ever to win an Oscar. That Oscar was one of two for An Officer And A Gentleman. The other winner was Louis Gossett Jr., who played the drill instructor and who took home Best Supporting Actor. (Gossett was only the fourth Black American ever to win an Oscar, after Hattie McDaniel, Sidney Poitier, and Isaac Hayes.) Nitzsche was still yelling about his Oscar a decade later, when he was on an episode of Cops, getting arrested for drunkenly threatening some kids with a gun after they’d stolen his hat.</p>
<p>Joe Cocker never scored another top-10 hit after “Up Where We Belong,” though he made it as close as #11 with his 1989 song “When The Night Comes.” Cocker sang a few more songs on a truly random collection of movie soundtracks: 9½ Weeks, Harry And The Hendersons, The Bodyguard. His old cover of “With A Little Help From My Friends” became the theme song for The Wonder Years. But Cocker spent most of the rest of his life on the nostalgia circuit. He died of lung cancer in 2014, when he was 70. Jennifer Warnes wrote a nice Billboard tribute after his death.</p>
<p>Jennifer Warnes, on the other hand, will be in this column again.</p>
<p>GRADE: 2/10</p>
<p>BONUS BEATS: Over the years, “Up Where We Belong” has soundtracked a great many parodies of the Officer And A Gentleman ending. The first one was in a classic Simpsons episode in 1990. Here it is:</p>
<p>Here’s David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston doing something similar on a 1996 episode of Friends:</p>
<p>And here’s South Park doing its version in 2005:</p>
<p>BONUS BONUS BEATS: 2Pac’s 1996 song “White Man’z World,” released under Pac’s Makaveli alias, interpolates “Up Where We Belong.” Here it is:</p>
<p>(2Pac will eventually appear in this column.)

<p>Als Santana, Joe Cocker und Bryan Adams in Heilbronn auftraten</p>
<p>Heilbronn Viele Weltstars haben über die Jahrzehnte Konzerte in Heilbronn gespielt. Ob Franken- oder Eisstadion: In der konzertfreien Coronazeit blicken wir auf einige besondere Auftritte zurück und sammeln auch Ihre persönlichen Konzert-Erinnerungen.</p>
<p>Von Ranjo Doering</p>
<p>Durch die Corona-Pandemie sind größere Konzerte bis zum 31. August verboten, Festivals wurden abgesagt, Tourneen vorsorglich in den Herbst oder ins kommende Jahr verschoben. Fraglich, ob in diesem Jahr noch einmal Großveranstaltungen stattfinden können. Die konzertfreie Zeit ist Anlass, um einen Blick in die Vergangenheit zu werfen.</p>
<p>Das Archiv der Heilbronner Stimme ist eine unerschöpfliche Fundgrube und dokumentiert die oftmals vergessenen Auftritte zahlreicher Weltstars in Heilbronn. In zwei Teilen möchten wir bei einem Streifzug an einige besondere Konzerte erinnern, ohne Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit. Der zweite Teil, der sich jüngeren Konzerten nach 2000 widmet (unter anderem mit den Backstreet Boys, der Kelly Family, Pink und den Toten Hosen), wird Ende Juni veröffentlicht.</p>
<p>Bildergalerie starten Teil 1: Große Konzerte und Open Air Konzerte in Heilbronn - Eine Auswahl Zusammengestellt von Archiv und Dokumentation der Heilbronner Stimme</p>
<p>Rockgruppe Santana tritt im Juni 1990 vor 1 500 Zuhörern im Heilbronner Eisstadion auf. Im Bild ist Carlos Santana. 12 Bilder Bildergalerie</p>
<p>Das Konzert von Joe Cocker im Eisstadion kostete 30 D-Mark</p>
<p>Die Heilbronner Falken tragen ihre Heimspiele heute in der Kolbenschmidt Arena aus. Doch das Eisstadion war über Jahrzehnte auch Anlaufpunkt für viele große Stars der Musikszene. Woodstock-Legende und Bluesröhre Joe Cocker tritt im Mai 1986 vor 2500 Besuchern im Eisstadion auf. Der aus heutiger Sicht fast unglaubliche Eintrittspreis: 30 D-Mark. Mit dabei hatte der Brite Balladen aus den Siebzigern (&ldquo;You are so beautiful&rdquo;) und bekannte Coverstücke wie &ldquo;With a little help from my friends&rdquo; und &ldquo;Watching the river flow&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ein weiterer Weltstar kommt im Juni 1990 nach Heilbronn. Carlos Santana spielt vor gerade einmal 1500 Besuchern in der nur halb gefüllten Eishalle und überzeugt mit seinem unverkennbaren Gitarrenspiel, eingebettet in eine Melange aus Latin und Rock, und Hits wie &ldquo;Samba-pa-ti&rdquo; und Europe&rdquo;. Weitere Topstars wie Status Quo (April 1984), Golden Earring (Juli 1985) und DJ Bobo (Juni 1994) ziehen Tausende Fans in die Eishalle.</p>
<p>Jetzt sind Sie gefragt!</p>
<p>Welche Konzerte in Heilbronn sind Ihnen im Gedächtnis geblieben? Schicken Sie uns Erinnerungen und Fotos (Mindestgröße 1 MB) an <a href="mailto:ranjo.doering@stimme.de">ranjo.doering@stimme.de</a>. Die besten Einsendungen greifen wir im zweiten Teil dieser Geschichte auf.</p>
<p>Nicht weniger bekannte Künstler spielen im Frankenstadion. Bei der ersten Goldien-Oldie-Summer-Night 1991 stehen die Rattles, Suzi Quatro sowie Ralph McTell und Donovan auf der Bühne. Bryan Adams singt im Jahr 2000 vor 15.000 Fans seinen Hit &ldquo;Summer of 69&rdquo;. Dass es heute keine Konzerte mehr im Frankenstadion gibt, liegt daran, dass die Auflagen der Stadtverwaltung immer höher wurden. Im Rathaus hatte man Angst um den Rasen, der nie eine Zierde war, und die Tartanbahn, die 2014 erneuert wurde.</p>
<p>Auch auf Youtube findet man viele Konzerte aus Heilbronn</p>
<p>Auf der Video-Plattform Youtube finden sich zahlreiche Konzerteeindrücke aus Heilbronn. Die Auftritte der Rockbands Die Ärzte (1994) und Motörhead (1989) sind als Audiodateien abrufbar. Auch Mitschnitte von Konzerten der Alternative-Punkrocker Beatsteaks in der Harmonie (2011) und Fettes Brot in der Gartenlaube (2008) sind zu finden.</p>

<h3 id="meet-the-worlds-most-recorded-drummer-bernard-pretty-purdie">&ldquo;Meet the world’s most recorded drummer, Bernard “Pretty” Purdie&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/385/files/2020/06/Bernard.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
The next time you’re hanging out listening to great music from your favorite artist or group, there’s a good chance that Bernard Purdie is playing the drums on that album.</p>
<p>He has played on over 3,000 albums. Yes I said 3,000 albums. His partial list include The Stones, Hall and Oates, Steely Dan, Joe Cocker, Aretha Franklin, BB King, Cat Stevens, Bette Midler, Robert Palmer, Richie Havens, Herbie Hancock and about 2800 more artists, bands and soundtracks.</p>
<p>I met Bernard about 20 years ago on a New Years Eve where he was playing at a restaurant in the West End section of Long Branch. I was with about 10 or 12 people at the table, several of them musicians and we started up a conversation with Bernard before he took the stage.</p>
<p>His easy going, welcoming personality made us all feel that we had known him for years. I felt like I was in my kitchen as his stories flowed with great interest and music history, peppered by laughter.</p>
<p>Well we had kept Bernard at our table for close to an hour and he was a half an hour late thanks to us in starting his gig. The owner of the restaurant while considerate of the monopoly we had with Bernard’s time, still had a restaurant full of customers waiting to hear him play.</p>
<p>I introduced him that night to the awaiting crowd and was mesmerized by the ease and music of his talent. A few years later thanks to my musical director Pat Guadagno, we booked him on my TV show The Big Joe Henry Variety Show.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the interview as much as I did talking with him. Bernard celebrated his 81st birthday last week. Time and age has been very kind to Bernard “Pretty” Purdie and we are very grateful.

<h3 id="5-places-to-see-live-music-in-the-twin-cities-this-week-yes-in-person">&ldquo;5 places to see live music in the Twin Cities this week (yes, in person!)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_8209cff5-c1c2-4285-82ca-eb1dd58427c9.jpg?h=630&amp;w=1200&amp;fit=crop&amp;bg=999&amp;crop=faces" alt="img">
Don’t call it a comeback. Not yet, anyway. But a few random hangouts around the Twin Cities are starting to offer live music again this weekend after state COVID-19 guidelines were eased recently to allow for 25% capacity in music venues and 50% in restaurants.</p>
<p>Here’s the list so far, with two places (Crooners and Tally’s) hosting their gigs outdoors.</p>
<p>Crooners: The ambitious Fridley supper club has two outdoor stages featuring live music. Most of the shows are at the Lakeside Cafe, a patio on Moore Lake, featuring the ever-versatile vocalist Debbie Duncan (4 &amp; 7 p.m. Fri.), guitar ace Billy McLaughlin (4 &amp; 7 p.m. Sat.), Arne Fogel saluting Dean Martin (4 p.m. Sun.), Mick Sterling saluting an acoustic Elton John (7 p.m. Sun.), Lori Dokken and Judi Vinar dueting (4 &amp; 7 p.m. Mon.) and Joyann Parker doing her Patsy Cline tribute (5:30 p.m. Wed.).</p>
<p>For Crooners’ drive-in parking lot series, pull up your vehicle to hear Mick Sterling and band salute Joe Cocker (4 p.m. Wed.) and Bruce Springsteen (7 p.m. Wed.). Forever Everly — a tribute group to the Everly Brothers featuring Boyd and Aimee Lee, Mary Jane Alm and others — harmonizes at the drive-in (7 p.m. Thu.). Reservations required. (6161 Hwy. 65 NE., Fridley, croonersmn.com)</p>
<p>Tally’s Dockside: The White Bear Lake shoreline party hub is hosting Jimmy Buffett-style singer Roger Jokela on Friday, revue-like rockers the Backyard Band on Saturday and Latinx multi-instrumentalist Joe Cruz on Wednesday. Call for reservations. (6-9 p.m., 4441 Lake Av. S., White Bear Lake, 651-429-2633)</p>
<p>Driftwood Char Bar: Bluesy rockers Smoldering Roots usher in the post-quarantine, half-capacity era at the south Minneapolis neighborhood bar Friday (7-10 p.m., $5 cover to benefit the venue). Then the popular Sunday twofer returns with the Lolo’s Ghost brunch show (11 a.m.-2 p.m.) and the Shotgun Ragtime Band’s Grateful Dead tribute (5 and 7 p.m.). Reservations required via Facebook. (4415 Nicollet Av. S., Mpls.)</p>
<p>Minnesota Music Cafe: St. Paul’s East Side mainstay is limiting capacity to 200 people to dance to the sounds of the Good the Bad the Funky (Fri.) and Westside (Sat.). Next week’s lineup includes John Knowles (Tue.), Desoto Street Blues (Wed.) and Smiling Cowboys (Thu.). Call for reservations. (449 Payne Av., St. Paul, minnesotamusiccafe.com, 651-776-4699)</p>
<p>Wilebski’s Blues Saloon: They’re promising to sanitize the microphones and practice social distancing for the return of the weekly Greatest Jam on Earth every Tuesday, 8 p.m., at the venerable St. Paul blues hall. First come, first served. (1638 Rice St., St. Paul, 651-207-0000)

<h3 id="woodstock-50-organizers-seek-tens-of-millions-in-new-lawsuit">&ldquo;Woodstock 50 organizers seek ‘tens of millions’ in new lawsuit&rdquo;</h3>

Woodstock 50 organizers are seeking tens of millions of dollars in a new lawsuit over the canceled anniversary concert festival planned in Central New York last year.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone reports a complaint filed Wednesday in New York Supreme Court blames Woodstock 50′s former financial partner Dentsu Group and its affiliates, Dentsu Aegis Network, MKTG and Amplifi Live, “for the destruction of the Woodstock 50 Anniversary Festival.” Dentsu, a Japanese conglomerate that was the event’s primary investor, pulled out in April 2019 over concerns about organization issues behind the scenes and disputes about capacity.</p>
<p>“Despite Woodstock 50′s best efforts, Dentsu’s sabotage was effective and complete, and directly resulted in huge damages to Woodstock 50,” the suit claims. “As a result of Dentsu’s egregious conduct, Woodstock 50 is entitled to tens of millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Woodstock festival was originally scheduled for Aug. 16-18 at Watkins Glen, New York, but fell apart when Dentsu and producers pulled out. Woodstock 50 lost the site after missing a final $150,000 payment and attempted to move to Vernon Downs, but organizers were denied multiple times by the Town of Vernon due to safety concerns and incomplete permit applications.</p>
<p>Woodstock 50 was officially canceled in July 2019. All performers — including Jay-Z, Miley Cyrus, Santana, The Lumineers, Dead &amp; Company, John Fogerty, Chance the Rapper, The Raconteurs, Janelle Monae, Halsey and Imagine Dragons — were paid in advance for a total of $30 million.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges Dentsu interfered with Woodstock 50 organizers’ attempts to stage the festival without them. Dentsu denied wrongdoing, telling Rolling Stone it “acted in the best interest of the public” when it pulled out and vowed to continue a court battle.</p>
<p>“After a full evidentiary hearing, the court credited Amplifi Live’s evidence that a safe and profitable festival could not be mounted, and therefore refused to order Amplfi Live to continue funding the project,” a rep for Amplifi Live said in a statement. “That decision was affirmed on appeal. The parties are about to engage in an arbitration hearing, but Woodstock 50 prefers baseless claims in press releases rather than to have the parties’ dispute decided by arbitrators.”</p>
<p>The original Woodstock festival was held Aug. 15-18, 1969, at Max Yasgur’s dairy farm in Bethel. More than 400,000 people came to see legendary performances by Richie Havens, Jefferson Airplane, The Who, Joan Baez, Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Joe Cocker, the Grateful Dead and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.</p>
<p>The iconic concert was revisited in 1994 with a modern lineup of artists like Nine Inch Nails, Sheryl Crow, Metallica, Cypress Hill and Red Hot Chili Peppers in Saugerties, but Woodstock ’99 — held at Griffiss Air Force Base (less than 20 miles from Vernon) in Rome, New York — was marred by riots, fires and allegations of sexual assault.</p>
<p>A smaller 50th anniversary celebration was held in August with original performers like Santana, Fogerty and Arlo Guthrie at Bethel Woods, the site of the original festival.</p>
