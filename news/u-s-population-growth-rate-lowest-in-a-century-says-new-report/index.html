The UNH report notes that U.S. deaths rose to a record high of 2,835,000 last year, while the number of births reached 3,792,000, the fewest since 1986. As a result, the surplus of 957,000 births over deaths was the least in more than 50 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of this smaller surplus and diminished immigration, the U.S. population grew by just 0.48 percent last year—the lowest population growth rate since 1919,&rdquo; note the UNH researchers. They also reported that &ldquo;more people died than were born last year in 1,430 of the 3,142 U.S. counties (46 percent).&rdquo; This is up from ten years ago when 889 counties (28 percent) had more deaths than births.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the low—that is to say, negative—population growth in 1919 was largely the result of the decimation caused by the Spanish flu pandemic. Between July 1918 and July 1919, U.S. population actually dropped by 60,000 people. Let&rsquo;s hope that the current coronavirus epidemic will not be so severe as to have a similar effect in the coming year or so.

<h3 id="us-does-not-have-close-to-the-most-coronavirus-cases-when-adjusted-for-population">US does not have close to the most coronavirus cases when adjusted for population</h3>
<p><img src="https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8ad88ef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3729x1958+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F6e%2F0f%2Ff516ae5d44d4b5de9c80dd60a5d4%2Fistock-863492778.jpg" alt="img">
When the United States on Thursday overtook the rest of the world in reported cases of the coronavirus, it immediately drew international headlines. While technically true, this is a misleading metric because when those numbers are adjusted for population, the U.S. does not actually have close to the most cases.</p>
<p>Before going further, it&rsquo;s worth offering a few caveats. Comparing international data at this point is tricky. Since the virus hit different countries at different times, not all countries are on the same point in the curve, meaning some countries that are trailing now can more than catch up in the weeks and months ahead. Furthermore, not all countries have the same metrics for reporting cases, nor do they all test at the same rate or administer tests with the same reliability.</p>
<p>In other cases, particularly the authoritarian regimes of Iran and China, there is serious reason to doubt whether they are truthfully reporting cases. In a five-week period from Jan. 23 to Feb. 29, China reported that the number of cases rose from 920 to nearly 80,000. It now expects the world to believe that its growth in new cases has essentially flat-lined and is now at just 81,782. This is in no way plausible or consistent with other more credible countries, such as South Korea, that have seen their curves flatten in a much more gradual way.</p>
<p>But, for the sake of this exercise, I took the raw case counts from the Johns Hopkins University database for the top 10 countries, and then I adjusted those same countries for the U.S. population.</p>
<p>So, for instance, on a raw basis, there are 83,507 reported cases of the coronavirus in the U.S., compared with 80,589 in Italy. But the U.S. has about 5.5 times the population of Italy. If Italy were scaled up to the U.S. population, it would have the equivalent of 443,237 cases.</p>
<p>Among the same 10 countries, the U.S. would actually rank seventh instead of first. (To be clear, this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the U.S. is seventh in the entire world because I only did adjustments for 10 countries, not for all 175 countries and regions with confirmed cases).</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that the coronavirus isn&rsquo;t a serious threat in the U.S., particularly in New York City. There are reasons to fear the strain on the medical system if things continue on their current trajectory. That said, comparing overall cases without the context of population isn&rsquo;t terribly useful for understanding what is happening.</p>

<h3 id="when-adjusted-for-population-us-currently-trails-at-least-six-other-nations-in-number-of-coronavirus-cases-report-says">When Adjusted For Population, U.S. Currently Trails At Least Six Other Nations In Number Of Coronavirus Cases, Report Says</h3>
<p><img src="https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2020/02/GettyImages-973730810.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=675&amp;ixlib=react-8.6.4" alt="img">
On Thursday, many news reports trumpeted that the United States had become the nation with the most reported cases of the coronavirus, but they ignored an essential fact; among major countries which one can assume are offering valid statistics, when adjusted for population, the United States trails many other countries in the number of cases.</p>
<p>It is true that the United States may be behind many other nations as to when the coronavirus took hold. As Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner notes, “Furthermore, not all countries have the same metrics for reporting cases, nor do they all test at the same rate or administer tests with the same reliability.” And nations such as China and Iran are not known for their transparency.</p>
<p>Using the raw case counts from the Johns Hopkins University database for the top 10 countries on Thursday, Klein explained, “So, for instance, on a raw basis, there are 83,507 reported cases of the coronavirus in the U.S., compared with 80,589 in Italy. But the U.S. has about 5.5 times the population of Italy. If Italy were scaled up to the U.S. population, it would have the equivalent of 443,237 cases.”</p>
<p>The statistics for 10 nations, (including Iran and China, which may be far from accurate) read like this, according to Klein:</p>
<p>Switzerland: 457,683</p>
<p>Italy: 443,239</p>
<p>Spain: 405,731</p>
<p>Germany: 174,693</p>
<p>France: 147,030</p>
<p>Iran: 118,341</p>
<p>United States: 83,507</p>
<p>United Kingdom: 59,045</p>
<p>South Korea: 58,644</p>
<p>China: 19,882</p>
<p>The New York Times reported on Thursday that Agata Gostynska-Jakubowska of the Center for European Reform in Brussels insisted the problems in Europe from the coronavirus were exacerbated by a lack of coordination among member countries of the European union, stating, “We need to be pretty honest and say that the initial E.U. response was chaotic and belated,” that after the problems with the coronavirus developed in Italy, “member states took center stage while the commission and other E.U. institutions were rather absent, and the harm was done, playing into the hands of Euroskeptics.’’</p>
<p>Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, echoed, “There is still a huge risk to the union. All the disintegrative tendencies can accelerate.’’</p>
<p>An advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron sniped at the United States, “Mistakes were made for sure, there was some flip-flopping, hesitations, but that’s the case everywhere in the world. When we see what’s going on in the United States today, Europe is not the continent that’s the least organized.”</p>
<p>Although the European Union wants its member nations to help each other, it has also restricted travel from other nations into its area; as The New York Times reported last week:</p>
<p>The European Union banned nonessential travel from outside the bloc into 26 nations stretching from Portugal to Finland, home to more than 400 million people, for 30 days, as Europe’s leaders grudgingly, belatedly accepted that being at the heart of a global pandemic and trying to fight it will mean severe social and economic hardship.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister acknowledged this week, “The numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating. We are only a matter of weeks — two or three — behind Italy.”
