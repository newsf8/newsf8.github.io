<p>Yoga guru Ramdev&rsquo;s Patanjali Ayurved on Wednesday said there are no AYUSH Ministry restrictions on selling Coronil, a drug the company recently launched as a medicine for COVID-19 but is now calling it a product to manage the disease.</p>
<p>The Union ministry confirmed that Patanjali can sell the product but not as a cure for COVID-19.</p>
<p>AYUSH Ministry has only given permission to sell this particular formulation as immunity booster and not as a medicinal cure for COVID-19, it said.</p>

They are probably one of Tinseltown&rsquo;s most adorable couples, but how much do we really know about Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal?</p>
<p>Besides a few details like they met on the sets of their film Fukrey and fell in love, the details about their love story are a well kept secret as the couple always maintained a low profile barring a few instances.

Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D’Souza celebrated the National Doctors’ Day 2020 in a very unique way. The much-loved B-town couple joined the bandwagon of celebs wishing and thanking doctors. However, they just did not stop at gratitude but also pledged to donate their organs as a gift of life to someone. The duo shared a heartwarming video of this announcement and also urged and encouraged others to do the same. National Doctors’ Day 2020: Ananya Panday Pays Tribute To Her Late Grandfather Dr Sharad Panday and Thanks All ‘Superhero Doctors’ For Their Efforts.</p>
<p>The caption of their post reads as, “@riteishd and me have been thinking about it for a long time but unfortunately didn’t get down to doing it. Today on Doctor’s Day we pledge to donate our organs. We want to thank Dr Nozer Sherier and FOGSI for inspiring us. The greatest gift you can give someone is ‘The gift of life’..We urge you all to take a part in this initiate and pledge to save lives, pledge to donate your organs.”</p>
<p>Genelia and Ritesh</p>
<p>It was indeed a very thoughtful gesture shown by the Masti actors. Donating organs is one of the most thoughtful and selfless gestures of all and that can sure be an option for the betterment of lives. Apart from that, simply following the instructions and social distancing rules during lockdown is something you can do to help doctors.</p>

<h3 id="joss-whedon-has-no-comment-on-ray-fishers-justice-league-abuse-allegations">&ldquo;Joss Whedon Has No Comment on Ray Fisher’s Justice League Abuse Allegations&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://filmyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Joss-Whedon-Has-No-Comment-on-Ray-Fishers-Justice-League.jpg" alt="img">
Joss Whedon chose not to comment on Ray Fisher’s allegations. The director has been accused of “gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable behavior,” on the set of Justice League by the Cyborg actor. Fisher hinted at some trouble a few days ago when he announced that he was forcefully retracting anything nice he ever had to say about Whedon’s work on the movie. This is the first time that a Justice League actor has come forward to announce that the director acted inappropriately on the set.</p>
<p>When reached for comment on Ray Fisher’s Justice League set allegations, Joss Whedon did not have a response. He has not posted anything on social media either. However, actor Alan Tudyk weighed in on the situation earlier today on social media. “Wasn’t there, but I have known Joss for 17 years, I honestly can’t even imagine it and I have a pretty good imagination,” said Tudyk who received a variety of responses from people either on Whedon’s side or Fisher’s. For the most part, the fans are siding with Fisher.</p>
<p>RELATED: Cyborg Actor Accuses Joss Whedon of Abusive and Gross Behavior on Justice League Set</p>
<p>Before Justice League hit theaters, Joss Whedon was accused of a number of things by his ex-wife. This seems to be something that keeps popping up when people discuss the director and Ray Fisher’s allegations, though it’s unclear if they are related in any way. Whatever the case may be, people are waiting to hear from the director, or anyone else from the production, to get a better take on what went on while they were making the movie. It’s also unclear if this “unprofessional” attitude was directed solely at Fisher and not the rest of the cast.</p>
<p>Ray Fisher has been one of the most vocal supporters of Zack Snyder over the years and he has been a lot more outspoken since the Snyder Cut of Justice League was officially announced. Originally, Snyder wanted to have Fisher’s Cyborg character to be at the forefront of the movie. He teased this many times before it was announced that his version of Justice League was going to premiere on HBO Max. One has to imagine that Snyder has a lot of thoughts about what went down on the set after he had to leave, though he has, for the most part, stayed silent on the matter.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if Joss Whedon does take the time to Ray Fisher’s allegations. It will also be interesting to see if Geoff Johns or Jon Berg have anything to say, since Fisher put them on blast in the same tweet. Regardless, it seems that things might get pretty awkward on the set of The Flash for more than a few people. It has been rumored for months that the actor will be returning to the Cyborg role in the upcoming Flash movie, though it has not been officially confirmed. You can check out Ray Fisher’s allegations below.

<h3 id="state-shouldnt-play-favorites">&ldquo;State shouldn’t play favorites&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s24474.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/125269039_web1_guest-commentary.jpg" alt="img">
RALEIGH — With hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians out of work and millions fearful about their futures, state and local policymakers are about to encounter a parade of companies, industries, and special-interest groups asking for targeted tax breaks and other handouts.</p>
<p>They should say no. Making North Carolina a more attractive place to live, work, shop, invest, and create businesses must be a high priority. But secret deals and preferential treatment are the wrong tools for the job.</p>
<p>While they butt heads on other issues, conservatives and progressives ought to agree on this. Company A ought not to confront a higher tax burden than Company B simply because some politicians think Company B is a better “investment.” They are in no position to know that. We the voters don’t put them in office so they can act as venture capitalists. They possess neither the expertise nor the information to play that role well. Even the attempt invites corruption and adverse economic consequences.</p>
<p>Legitimate governments are authorized to collect taxes only to pay for core public services. If our elected representatives think more revenue is needed to provide the necessary quantity and quality of services, they should raise the tax rate. If they think government should do fewer jobs, or can do the same jobs more efficiently, they should lower the tax rate.</p>
<p>That is, they should raise and lower taxes for all households and businesses in like circumstances. They shouldn’t play favorites.</p>
<p>Consider this thought experiment. Let’s say you live in a small coastal community. The town council decides that it would be a good idea to attract a certain billionaire to build a vacation home there. They know she will build big and ornate, employing lots of workers, and will spend freely on other goods and services once she’s a resident. She will also likely make large gifts to the hospital, the university, and other local charities.</p>
<p>So the town council votes to exempt her from property taxes for 20 years if she will build her beachfront mansion there. She readily agrees. How would you feel about having to pay your property taxes while she pays none?</p>
<p>Some defenders of selective tax breaks say they aren’t subsidizing a recipient company. They’re just allowing the company to keep more of their own revenues. Of course, lowering taxes isn’t a subsidy in conceptual terms. But if you lower taxes selectively and then continue to deliver public services universally, you are making some households and businesses pay more than others for the same services. You are making them cross-subsidize the recipient of the tax break.</p>
<p>Defenders of selective tax breaks also routinely say that while they find the policy unappealing or even unjust, they have no choice. Economic development is a bidding war. If you don’t pay, you can’t play. Businesses will go elsewhere.</p>
<p>A few might, yes. But policymakers should look at overall economic effects, not just whether a particular firm or industry relocates. In careful studies of selective-incentive policies, researchers usually find either no net benefits or net economic harm, even if incentives can reasonably be credited with recruiting a particular clump of jobs to a particular place.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe state and local taxes don’t affect economic decisions much, anyway, and targeting the tax relief doesn’t make any difference. Other scholars distinguish between broad changes in tax burdens or marginal rates, for which they do find important economic effects, and targeted incentives, which have nil to negative effects.</p>
<p>How could this be? Well, playing favorites is risky. Those who don’t get special treatment may be angered and go elsewhere, including entrepreneurs starting businesses that might be small at first but later grow to be large spenders and employers. And if a favored project goes south — because, after all, politicians lack both the information and the incentives to “bet” well — other businesses may be left holding the bag for expanded services without an adequate tax base to finance them.</p>
<p>On economic policy, consistency is a virtue.</p>

<h3 id="at-99-cpc-governance-legitimacy-shines-brighter-in-time-of-global-uncertainty">&ldquo;At 99, CPC governance legitimacy shines brighter in time of global uncertainty&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://image.cns.com.cn/ecns_editor/transform/20200701/I8jA-fzxrmsp3987533.jpg" alt="img">
The Communist Party of China (CPC) is embracing its 99th anniversary as it leads the country&rsquo;s homestretch toward building a moderately prosperous society in all respects despite the impact of COVID-19 and a global economic recession.</p>
<p>The CPC has reaffirmed its commitment to realizing its first centenary goal of creating a well-off society for 1.4 billion Chinese people on schedule. This transformation will be one of the world&rsquo;s most exciting stories in modern history.</p>
<p>This miracle is created by a political party that has faced misunderstanding, distrust and even misjudgement that its existence would be short-lived.</p>
<p>Uncertainties ripple through the world today, calling into question the definition of governance legitimacy. In this context, the CPC&rsquo;s ideas and practices are increasingly relevant and inspiring in the eyes of the international community.</p>
<p>STAYING TRUE TO FOUNDING MISSION</p>
<p>Ever since the Party&rsquo;s founding on July 1, 1921, the Chinese communists have been struggling to seek fulfillment for the Chinese people, and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. After seven decades of governance, the CPC has transformed China from an isolated agricultural society into the world&rsquo;s second-largest open economy.</p>
<p>Fireworks explode during a grand evening gala marking the 70th founding anniversary of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing, capital of China, Oct. 1, 2019. (Xinhua/Lan Hongguang)</p>
<p>Now the CPC is leading the nation&rsquo;s battle to wipe out the absolute poverty that has haunted the nation for thousands of years. The Party sends its finest cadres to the frontlines to make sure not a single family is left behind on the nation&rsquo;s way to common prosperity.</p>
<p>Sticking to its people-centered philosophy, the Party never stops striving to meet the people&rsquo;s needs for a better life, ranging from those in education, employment, medical services and housing, to environment, security, and fairness and justice.</p>
<p>The Party has no special interests of its own. It has never been afraid of breaking the shelters of vested interests, and sweeping out obstacles hampering development.</p>
<p>That is why the CPC is competent to think both strategically and pragmatically. The leadership keeps its eye on the country&rsquo;s sustainable future and formulates long-term plans, while at the same time setting short-term goals to solve prominent issues that concern the people the most.</p>
<p>A recent survey by the Pew Research Center finds China tops the 2019 global rankings in terms of the levels of satisfaction with government performance, with over 86 percent of Chinese surveyed expressing satisfaction, far above the global average of 47 percent.</p>
<p>This wide public support is the key to the CPC&rsquo;s strength and confidence in long-term governance.</p>
<p>STICKING TO ITS OWN PATH</p>
<p>The CPC has created China&rsquo;s recipe for success, officially called &ldquo;socialism with Chinese characteristics.&rdquo; It is a path suited to China&rsquo;s national conditions.</p>

<p>Following this path, China keeps pushing forward reform and opening up. The market-government relationship, where the market plays a decisive role in resource allocation and the government better serves its duty, boosts steady and healthy economic development. Stability is maintained. Social creativity is sparked. The principle of &ldquo;the people running the country&rdquo; is put into practice in China&rsquo;s political and social activities.</p>
<p>China is proving its resilience in the face of challenges, with its innovation faster, middle class bigger, cultural life richer, and confidence stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>As the global economy contracts by 4.9-percent in a coronavirus-driven plunge in output, China is the only major economy that could see growth this year, according to a forecast by the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>ABILITY TO PURIFY, IMPROVE, REFORM ITSELF</p>
<p>To have the courage to carry out self-reform and conduct strict self-governance is the most distinctive part of the Party&rsquo;s character.</p>

<p>The CPC has drawn lessons from many political forces that have failed to break the historical cycle of gaining political power only to lose it. It tightens discipline, improves work styles, fights corruption, and punishes wrongdoing. China has also completed massive institutional reform, touching upon a wide range of entities of the Party and the state, paving the way for future development. Its self-reform will never end.</p>
<p>The CPC is a dynamic organization with a strong ability to learn and to adapt. It has been advancing theoretical explorations and adapting Marxism to a Chinese context. By improving itself, the CPC has enhanced its ability to lead the country in the course of innovation-driven, coordinated, green, open, and shared development.</p>
<p>STRESSING UNITY &amp;VITALITY</p>
<p>The CPC upholds democratic centralism. It fully expands intraparty democracy, giving play to the initiative and creativity of Party organizations at all levels as well as its members. Once decisions are made, they should be effectively implemented.</p>
<p>The Party exercises overall leadership and coordinates work in all areas. Under the CPC leadership, people&rsquo;s congresses, governments, and supervisory, judicial, procuratorial, and social organizations work together coordinately.</p>
<p>Such mechanisms are especially vital for a big country with complicated national conditions. The system has proven efficient in pooling resources to deal with major problems, such as epidemic prevention and control, relieving natural disasters, and supporting the development of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The CPC forges a contingent of competent and professional officials, who are a central pillar of strength for the cause of the CPC. Its distinctive organizational arrangements of selecting and appointing officials guarantee the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and maintain stability and continuity of policies, while stimulating vitality for development.</p>
<p>GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE</p>
<p>The CPC maintains an open mind towards development experiences of other countries, and is ready to share its own in this increasingly connected world. It embraces the surging trends of global multi-polarity, economic globalization, IT application, and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>The Party is committed to building a community with a shared future for humanity. China has become an indispensable force in resolving global and regional issues, from wealth inequality and trade and investment to climate change, terrorism, and peace-keeping.</p>
<p>The CPC has not only sought to serve the Chinese people, but also made contributions to the development of the whole world through the Belt and Road Initiative, said Salah Adly, general secretary of the Egyptian Communist Party. &ldquo;China pursues a strategy of international cooperation based on mutual benefit, peace, and prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>China is now moving closer to the world&rsquo;s center stage, and closer than ever before to national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>The victory to realize the first centenary goal lies ahead, but so do hardships. China is still the world&rsquo;s biggest developing country. It is also facing a complicated external environment, especially when protectionism and unilateralism are bringing uncertainty to the world.</p>
<p>The CPC must continue to reinforce itself for another lofty target: a great, modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful.</p>
<p>As it turns 99, the Party is starting anew to answer history&rsquo;s call in a new era.
