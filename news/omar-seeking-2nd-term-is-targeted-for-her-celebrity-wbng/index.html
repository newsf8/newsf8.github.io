<p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s bid for a second term is getting a well-funded test from an opponent trying to turn her celebrity against her. Antone Melton-Meaux, an attorney and mediator who has never held political office, raised nearly $4 million to take on Omar in Minnesota’s Aug. 11 primary. Melton-Meaux is telling voters that he’ll pay more attention to them than to being famous. That’s a dig at Omar, one of the four freshmen progressives known collectively as The Squad. Omar dismisses the criticism, saying she’s been effective and that some people want to stop her.

<p>We&rsquo;re now well into the second half of the year, which means we&rsquo;ve got a few things to look forward to like the 2020 series of I&rsquo;m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
<p>And while there were some concerns about whether or not this year&rsquo;s series would be happening due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, ITV has confirmed it will go ahead as planned.</p>
<p>Which has got everyone thinking about who feature on this year&rsquo;s series?</p>
<p>The 2020 contestants are yet to be officially revealed.</p>
<p>However, rumours have started to surface about who could be heading into the jungle this year.</p>
<p>Rumours include the likes of Tiger King&rsquo;s Carole Baskin, Maya Jama and AJ Pritchard.</p>
<p>Last year Eastenders babe Jacqueline Jossa was crowned queen of the jungle.</p>
<p>But who succeed her? Here are all the famous names tipped to appear in this year&rsquo;s series.</p>
<p>An earlier version of this story appeared on WalesOnline.</p>
<p>AJ Pritchard</p>

<p>The Strictly Come Dancing star is at odds of 4/6 to enter the jungle this year, according to Ladbrokes.</p>
<p>Carole Baskin</p>
<p>Made famous by Netflix documentary Tiger King, sources reckon Carole has been offered a big money deal to appear on the show. A source told The Sun: &ldquo;Producers have made a formal approach and hope she will do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle Visage</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Michelle Visage wowed UK audiences when she took part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2019 and then went on to host the first series of RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race UK.</p>
<p>Now, she&rsquo;s tipped to join the line-up of I&rsquo;m A Celebrity. Ladbrokes have her at odds of 6/1 to enter the Australian jungle.</p>
<p>Maya Jama</p>
<p>Rising star Maya Jama is everywhere this year after ditching her breakfast show on Radio 1 to host Save Our Summer with Peter Crouch.</p>
<p>Her profile means producers are keen to get her on board, insiders say.</p>
<p>Katie Price</p>
<p>(Image: ITV)</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s no stranger to I&rsquo;m A Celebrity, where she met former husband Peter Andre - and there are rumours Katie might be making a return this year.</p>
<p>This week she broke both ankles in an accident on holiday in Turkey, which could put paid to her chances of going in.</p>
<p>Jessie J</p>
<p>Singer and occasional TV host Jessie J has said she wants to put her music first - but sources believe she&rsquo;s in the running.</p>
<p>An insider told The Sun Online: &ldquo;Jessie’s been offered good money but isn’t sure that the show is for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Merson</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll usually find sports stars among the I&rsquo;m A Celebrity cast - and this year Paul Merson is rumoured to be on the list.</p>

<p>Married to Jacqueline Jossa, will he follow her into the jungle for this year&rsquo;s show?</p>
<p>Ricky Hatton</p>
<p>The former professional boxer is another name hotly tipped to enter the jungle.</p>
<p>Jeremy Clarkson</p>
<p>(Image: ITV)</p>
<p>The Grand Tour host has previously said he would be up for going on I&rsquo;m A Celebrity&hellip;Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
<p>He told Jonathan Ross: &ldquo;We all say no now because we&rsquo;ve got jobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re down the line and somebody said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a hundred grand to eat some maggots&rsquo;, count me in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark Ian Hoyle</p>
<p>The British blogger and YouTube star - better known as Ladbaby, is the bookies&rsquo; favourite to make an appearance this year.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes have him odds on to brave the harsh realities of surviving off beans and rice and take part in gruesome challenges in the jungle - or the wilds of Scotland, depending on where filming takes place.

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tm-comp-Mockup-Tamzin.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
STARS Tamzin Outhwaite and AJ Pritchard are set to appear on I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out of Here! — in a double blow to TV rival Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
<p>Ex-EastEnders actress Tamzin and professional dancer AJ have both had talks with the ITV jungle show’s bosses.</p>
<p>6 Tamzin Outwaite is in talks to take part in I&rsquo;m A Celeb - here is how she might look in the jungle</p>
<p>6 In a double blow to Strictly, AJ Pritchard has also been lined up for I&rsquo;m A Celeb</p>
<p>Tamzin, 49, has been a top target for BBC’s Strictly this year, while AJ, 25, has left the annual dancing contest after four years.</p>
<p>A source said: “Strictly would like to think that no one leaves the show and goes on to bigger things, but AJ will be very popular in the jungle and it’ll be a good platform for him.</p>
<p>“His deal is all but done and ITV are delighted they’ve been able to prise him away from their rivals.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, it’s early days with Tamzin but she’s someone producers have discussed going to Oz in the autumn — and she’s told pals she is 100 per cent not taking part in Strictly.</p>
<p>6 Former EastEnders actress Tamzin was a top target for the BBC dance competition Credit: BBC</p>
<p>“There’s some way to go in negotiations but she’s more likely to be eating a kangaroo testicle than wearing sequins this year.”</p>
<p>It comes after The Sun revealed that Strictly bosses were in crisis because talks over signings for this series stalled due to the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>They have been struggling to get stars to commit to the show and producers are being told the celebs may need to take on other better-paid projects to recoup money they have been losing while staying at home.</p>
<p>We also revealed last week how a £15million war chest had been prepared by ITV to ensure that I’m A Celeb enjoys a successful year after concerns about whether or not it would air.</p>
<p>6 A source says Tamzin is &lsquo;100 per cent not taking part in Strictly&rsquo; Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<p>Tamzin was first linked to a turn on Strictly last month, after she said it was 2020 “or never” to take part in the hit series.</p>
<p>She made the comments because her daughters — 12-year-old Florence, and Marnie, seven — were “desperate” for her to be on the show.</p>
<p>AJ was one of the stars of Strictly, before quitting in a shock move earlier this year to focus on presenting opportunities alongside his brother Curtis, 24, who was a finalist in last year’s Love Island.</p>
<p>6 Pro dancer AJ, who last competed with YouTuber Saffron Barker, quit Strictly earlier this year</p>

<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/180bea7d9d755883ec21c113d26c64ed9c3a8542/278_196_3022_1813/master/3022.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=b55f95913ef2bbd31d7fca00e859de19" alt="img">
Nine years ago, I flew to Detroit for what had by then become an international spectator sport: watching Charlie Sheen have a mental breakdown. In the previous months, Sheen had gone from “beloved bad boy cheeky chappie” to shattered wreck. He posted unhinged webcam videos in which he claimed to have “tiger blood”, and these proved so popular that he took the show on the road, in a tour titled Violent Torpedo Of Truth/Defeat Is Not An Option.</p>
<p>As a child, my parents took me to what was then the USSR, and we visited the Moscow State Circus. No one goes to a circus expecting to see happy wildlife, but the Moscow State Circus in 1988 took it to the next level. The animals were ragged, their fur patchy. I enjoyed a bear on a bicycle as much as the next 10-year-old, but watching that muzzled animal, so thin and bald I could see his bones working as he frantically pedalled, tested even my enthusiasm. Meanwhile, the crowds bayed.</p>
<p>It’s rare that you experience the literalisation of a cliche, so I long assumed that this was as close to bear-baiting as I would get. And it was, until I sat in the audience of Sheen’s tour. Sheen, who has since said he’s bipolar and HIV positive, lurched around the stage while the crowd called for anecdotes about porn stars and crack. When he failed to provide to their liking, they booed. Afterwards, I asked some audience members what they thought. “I wanted to see a train wreck. [But] I thought he’d be funnier,” one told me.</p>
<p>It is no revelation that being famous is rarely conducive to good mental health, nor is wanting to be famous generally a sign of personal stability. As a result, celebrity train wrecks come along with the regularity of actual trains, and yet they still fascinate, like a bear on a bicycle. Britney Spears shaving her head; Amy Winehouse in blood-stained ballet slippers; David Hasselhoff drunkenly trying to eat a cheeseburger while talking about loneliness – all of these happened in full view of the public, and we, the public, made them iconic, referencing, satirising and, later, meme-ing them into posterity.</p>
<p>Kanye West has long been an anomaly: a celebrity who goes off-script in an era when even “reality” TV shows have screenplays. Sometimes this has been for the good, such as in 2005 when, while raising money for victims of Hurricane Katrina, he announced on TV, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” At the time, he was pilloried, but now he would probably get his deserved plaudits. (I would like to take this moment to add that he was also right in 2009, when he said that Beyoncé’s still legendary Single Ladies video should have won the MTV Music award, and not Taylor Swift’s You Belong With Me. But this topic may still be too controversial to discuss.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially since the death of his mother, Donda, in 2007, this going off-script has been for the less-good. The footage last month of West launching his presidential bid by talking about the time God told him through his laptop not to abort his oldest child (a sentence not even Hunter S Thompson could have come up with at his most hysterically surreal) did not suggest he is an entirely well man. As I write, his wife, Kim Kardashian West, has released a statement acknowledging her husband’s bipolar disorder and pleading for “compassion and empathy”. It feels especially poignant that this episode should have happened the same week West released his new album, Donda, named after his mother.</p>
<p>For all the talk these days about mental health, fans have a push-pull-push relationship with the mental health of celebrities. Women are envied for their extreme thinness, and then snarked at for looking anorexic; child stars are celebrated for faking emotions, and then derided when they grow up and have a confused relationship with reality, as detailed in the fascinating recent documentary Showbiz Kids, by former child actor Alex Winter. This was also gently touched on in Judy, last year’s biopic about Judy Garland, in which fans are shown alternately loving Garland for her frailty and then resenting it when she can’t sing about that rainbow again. It’s a dynamic that would be familiar to many other stars, from Marilyn Monroe to Pete Doherty. Train-wrecks are fun, as long as they’re still sexy, cool and funny.</p>
<p>When I interviewed Sheen in 2016, I asked him whether the public’s expectations exacerbated his behaviour. “I think it led me to being something I wasn’t,” he said. “I guess it comes down to a measure of people-pleasing,” he said. Sheen took his bad-boy image to the extreme endpoint; Garland never stopped being a helpless little girl, to the delight and frustration of those around her; West is the brave truth-teller. As bystanders, we are fascinated, then mocking, then disgusted. But aren’t they just giving us what we want? Given how frequently this happens, and how we are surprised by it, again and again, you have to wonder.

They’re expected to grace our screens once again when I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! returns later this year, but presenters Ant and Dec have now announced they’ll be taking a much-needed break from work.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The duo – who fronted their Saturday Night Takeaway show in the earlier stages of the ongoing pandemic – told fans they were taking time out to spend some quality time with their loved ones.</p>
<p>Ant McPartlin, 44, and Declan Donnelly, 44, shared a joint statement to their Twitter account stating they’d be back at the end of August.</p>
<p>Alongside an image of them both relaxing, they said: “We’re both taking a break for a few weeks to spend time with family and friends. Wishing everyone a great month and we’ll see you at the end of August.”</p>

<p>Within seconds of the announcement, fans rushed to comment on the post with many wishing them a great break.</p>
<p>“Enjoy your family time both of you….im sitting in Newcastle Station at this very minute, waiting for my train to edinburgh for a mini break,” one wrote.</p>
<p>“Have a great time, thank you for all the content throughout lockdown and the past few months it’s really kept us going. See you soon,” another said.</p>
<p>Wishing Dec a happy anniversary with his wife Ali Alistall, who he married five years ago, a third wrote: “And why not. You deserve it. Thanks for all the entertainment. You’re both hilarious but we all knew that anyway. Have a nice break. See you in 4 weeks. Happy Anniversary as well Dec xx.”</p>

<p>Another commented on the rumours I’m A Celebrity… could be taking place in Scotland this year due to travel restrictions following coronavirus.</p>
<p>“PLEASE DON’T DO I’M A CELEBRITY IN SCOTLAND,” they said.</p>
<p>Ant and Dec’s break comes after ITV confirmed I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! would be returning to screens later this year with a special spin-off series.</p>
<p>It had been uncertain whether the show would be going ahead this year in recent weeks, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>However, the long-running reality series will air this autumn, and to mark the show’s 20th series, the broadcaster will also show a one-off documentary, I’m A Celebrity: A Jungle Story, looking back on I’m A Celeb’s best moments.</p>
<p>ITV</p>
<p>ITV boss Kevin Lygo previously said that the series “looks likely to return this year” but is planning for the show to air a month later than usual, in December.</p>
<p>He has admitted he is looking at alternatives, saying the team is “moving heaven and earth” to get the show back on air.</p>
<p>We can’t wait!</p>

Image copyright ITV Image caption Last year&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m a Celebrity show was won by Jacqueline Jossa [fifth from right]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m A Celebrity&hellip; Get Me Out Of Here! is to return to ITV this autumn, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale going back up to six episodes per week.</p>
<p>ITV&rsquo;s announcement ends uncertainty over whether I&rsquo;m A Celebrity, hosted by Ant and Dec, would resume amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent and The Voice UK will also restart production and extra soap episodes will start in September.</p>
<p>ITV boss Kevin Lygo was hopeful for new dramas to start filming as well.</p>
<p>Lygo, who is the channel&rsquo;s director of television, said that after keeping Coronation Street and Emmerdale on air during the past few months &ldquo;our daytime [TV] has never performed better and we had brand new entertainment shows on a Saturday, every week&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Coronation Street filming has resumed following a break during the pandemic</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a better place than we thought we might be and while I haven&rsquo;t got a crystal ball, I am hopeful that with a dozen or so dramas about to go back into production, we won&rsquo;t be watching repeats of Midsomer Murders in January after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ITV is also to broadcast a one-off documentary called I&rsquo;m A Celebrity: A Jungle Story, which will celebrate the very best moments of the show&rsquo;s 19-year history.</p>
<p>It confirmed the return of The Million Pound Cube, hosted by Philip Schofield, plus Family Fortunes with host Gino D&rsquo;Acampo, plus Supermarket Sweep, hosted by Rylan Clark-Neal, which is moving from ITV2 to ITV daytime.</p>
<p>ITV2 is to show a three-part Love Island special, where stars of the show look back at their best bits. On ITVBe, The Only Way Is Essex will return to twice a week and will celebrate its 10th birthday with a special reunion show and 10 special programmes.</p>
