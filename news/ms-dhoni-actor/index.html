<p>The actor&rsquo;s domestic help informed the police which arrived at his residence and started an initial investigation. His body was taken for autopsy. Manoj Sharma, the additional commissioner of police, Western Region, told PTI, &ldquo;He has committed suicide at his residence in Bandra. Our team is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sources from the Bandra Police said on the basis of primary information, a case of accidental death report will be registered. No suicide note was found from the spot, they said.</p>
<p>Sushant is widely known for his work as the protagonist in the biopic based on former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Directed by Neeraj Pandey, the biopic titled &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo; was released in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant was joined by actors Disha Patani and Kiara Advani in the lead roles. Shushant was praised by the critics, as well as fans, for brilliantly essaying the character of the two-time World Cup-winning Indian captain. The movie traced the journey of Dhoni from a boy in Ranchi to the biggest name in the world of cricket.</p>

<p>Shushant&rsquo;s last Bollywood film was &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo; which was directed by Dangal-fame Nitesh Tiwari. Chhichhore was a multi-starer movie.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took to his Twitter handle to offer his condolences to the family of the actor. Meanwhile, people have also started gathering outside his family&rsquo;s residence in Patna.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput&hellip;a bright young actor gone too soon. He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>The last social media post shared by the actor, who hailed from Patna, was dedicated to his mother, who passed away in 2002 when he was a teenager.</p>

<p>The actor committed suicide in Mumbai today. pic.twitter.com/3ofsOKTcd4 — ANI (@ANI) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>Earlier last week, Rajput&rsquo;s ex-manager, Disha Salian committed suicide by jumping off a building in Mumbai. Disha jumped off the 14th floor of a building in Malad, Mumbai. She was rushed to a hospital in Borivali where she was declared dead.</p>
<p>It is being said that the rising star of the Hindi film industry was going through stress and depression. His last Instagram post on June 3 was highlighting his pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops. Unending dreams carving an arc of smile. &ldquo;And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; read the Instagram post shared on June 3 with his mother&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>An engineering dropout, Rajput was inclined towards dancing when he was a student at Delhi Technological University. He soon enrolled in choreographer Shiamak Davar&rsquo;s dance classes and later joined acting guru Barry John&rsquo;s classes. He also performed as a background dancer in the song &ldquo;Dhoom again&rdquo; with Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the 2006 film &ldquo;Dhoom 2&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Very very sad to hear about this. RIP #sushantsinghrajput https://t.co/28BiK4Li0l — David Warner (@davidwarner31) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>People from the film industry, as well as the sportspersons, took to their social media handles to express their shock and dismay.</p>
<p>Shocked to learn that super talented actor #SushantSinghRajput is no more.He was from my city Patna. Remember meeting him in Rashtrapati Bhawan during oath taking ceremony last year. He had told me that his family lived in Rajiv Nagar,Patna. He had miles to go. He left too soon. — Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; director Tiwari said he had spoken to Rajput last week. &ldquo;I had to call people to confirm. It&rsquo;s so shocking and unfortunately true. I am at a loss for words. I spoke to him last week over messages. We would text each other on and off. Now, this is what I get to hear. He was like a younger brother to me,&rdquo; Tiwari told PTI.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted, &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan also expressed his shock and wrote on his Twitter handle, &ldquo;He loved me so much&hellip;I will miss him so much. His energy, enthusiasm and his full happy smile. May Allah bless his soul and my condolences to his near and dear ones. This is extremely sad&hellip;.and so shocking!!&rdquo;

Bollywood actor Disha Patani celebrated her 28th birthday on Saturday. The actor is popularly known for her role in the movie MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, in which she played the role of former Indian cricket captain&rsquo;s first lover, starring alongside actor Sushant Singh Rajput. In a throwback interview to promote the film, the 28-year-old had spoken on MS Dhoni, finding the 2011 World Cup winning captain amazing.</p>

<p>Disha Patani rates MS Dhoni hotter than Virat Kohli</p>
<p>MS Dhoni: The Untold Story was released back in 2016. During an interview with Bollywood Hungama during the course of promotion of the biopic, Disha Patani was asked by the interviewer to rate some of the Indian cricketers based on their &lsquo;hotness quotient&rsquo;. Players like Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja were mentioned to the actress. Much to the surprise of her fans, Disha Patani rated Dhoni 10/10, while the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja received an 8 rating. Indian skipper Virat Kohli received a great score of 9 from the actor.</p>

<p>Disha Patani was also asked about her perfect date with an Indian cricketer. In no time, she mentioned the now married Virat Kohli as the ideal cricketer she would go on a date with. Patani is thought to be an avid cricket lover, which was visible in another of her several interviews. She was asked about the biggest match-winner in Indian cricket. And she didn&rsquo;t disappoint with her witty response, snubbing the likes of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli and picking Jasprit Bumrah instead.</p>

<p>During the promotional interview for her movie Malang earlier this year, Disha Patani claimed that Jasprit Bumrah was one of the finest cricketers that the country has. She also hoped of a magical performance from the bowler against New Zealand on February 2, which India did win by seven runs. Bumrah picked three wickets in that match while conceding 12 runs in four overs.</p>
<p>Disha Patani is said to feature in several movies this year. The Malang actress has been roped in for Ek Villain 2 and Radhe. But the shooting of the two projects have been on a halt due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jagranimages.com/images/newimg/14062020/14_06_2020-shushantdhoni1_20390188_15621248.jpg" alt="img">
नई दिल्ली, जेएनएन। MS Dhoni टीम इंडिया के सबसे सफल कप्तान, दो-दो वर्ल्ड कप इस कप्तान के नाम और उनकी फिल्म MS Dhoni: The Untold Story जब इस फिल्म की बात की जाती है तो जहन में माही का चरित्र निभाने वाले हिंदी फिल्म जगत के अभिनेता सुशांत सिंह राजपूत का चेहरा सामने आता है। सुशांत ने माही के चरित्र को सिल्वर स्क्रीन पर जिस तरीके से निभाया था वो इतिहास जरूर बन गया, लेकिन शायद ही किसी ने ये सोचा होगा कि इतनी कम उम्र में ये अभिनेता हमारे बीच नहीं रहेगा।</p>
<p>खबरों के मुताबिक सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने मुंबई में बांद्रा स्थित अपने फ्लैट पर फांसी लगाकर आत्महत्या कर ली। हालांकि इसके सही कारणों का पता नहीं चल पाया है। MS Dhoni फिल्म की बात करें तो उन्होंने माही के किरदार को जीवंत कर दिया था। इस फिल्म में हमें उनके कई रूप देखने को मिले, एक बेटा, भाई, दोस्त, प्रेमी, एक संघर्ष करने वाला क्रिकेटर, एक कप्तान, सफल खिलाड़ी और वर्ल्ड कप विजेता कप्तान। हर रोल में उन्होंने खुद के ऐसे ढ़ाला था जैसे कि हम सबकी नजरों के सामने धौनी खुद हों। इस कमाल के अभिनेता ने इस फिल्म में अपने अभिनय से जान डाल दी थी और ये काफी सफल फिल्म रही थी।</p>
<p>सिर्फ 34 साल के सुशांत सिंह राजपूत इतना बड़ा कदम उठा लेंगे इसकी उम्मीद शायद ही किसी ने की होगी। 21 जनवरी 1986 को बिहार (पटना) में जन्मे सुशांत ने टीवी से अपने करियर की शुरुआत की थी और उनकी पहली हिंदी फिल्म काई पो छे थी जो साल 2013 में बनी थी। इसके बाद उन्होंने पीछे मुड़कर नहीं देखा और फिर उन्होंने शुद्ध देसी रोमांच, पीके, डिकेक्टिव व्योमकेश बक्शी, राब्ता, वेलकम टू न्यूयॉर्क, केदारनाथ, सोनचीड़िया, छिछोरे और ड्राइव जैसी फिल्में की थी। टीवी सीरियल पवित्र रिश्ता के जरिए उन्हें पहचान मिली थी। उन्होंने अपने बेहतरीन अभियन के दम पर कई अवॉर्ड भी जीते थे।</p>

<h3 id="suresh-raina-reveals-two-actors-whom-he-would-prefer-in-his-biopic">&ldquo;Suresh Raina Reveals Two Actors Whom He Would Prefer In His Biopic&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cricketaddictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A70I3810.jpg" alt="img">
Indian middle-order batsman and finisher Suresh Raina has opened up on the actor, who he would prefer playing his role in his biopic, if ever created. Unlike all other cricketers, Suresh Raina has remained in the confines of his home amid the shutdown. The shutdown has prevented the thirteenth season of the IPL as well, whose initial starting date was 29th March.</p>

<p>The likes of MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, and Murali Vijay had all resumed training before the lucrative tournament. All three are vital players of three-time champions Chennai Super Kings with Raina as one of the top run-getters in the competition history. The 13th edition of the IPL currently stands postponed indefinitely</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the southpaw took to Twitter, involving in a Q&amp;A session when a fan posed a question “If a movie is made on you which actor would you prefer? Or would you act urself?”. Cricket biopics are one of the most exciting ones. MS Dhoni’s biopic, which released back in 2016, received plenty of accolades, having narrated how the former Indian captain overcame all the struggles to make it big.</p>
<p>When asked Raina, the 34-year-old chose Dulquer Salman or Shahid Kapoor as the ones. Dulquer Salman is widely remembered for his role in a South Indian film named “Ok Kanmani”. At the same time, Shahid Kapoor has garnered appreciations for his acting in movies like Jab We Met, Udta Punjab, and Haider.</p>

<p>I am cooking different dishes currently: Suresh Raina</p>
<p>The current lockdown period has given the cricketers plenty of time with their family as well as an opportunity to try out new things. When asked the Uttar Pradesh batsman, he revealed that he is trying cooking new types of dishes. Suresh Raina last played for India in 2018 with inconsistencies ruling him out of contention. He was part of India’s squad that lifted the World Cup in 2011. The left-handed batsman has featured in 18 Tests, 226 ODIs, and 78 T20Is.
