<p>Politicians and police are continuing to crack down on intellectual property theft in what is costing the U.S. as much as $600 billion a year. But what if you could teach scientists to protect themselves as an added layer of security?</p>
<p>The University of Dayton School of Law and the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) have developed the first-of-it&rsquo;s-kind online training course for researchers so they can learn how to prevent the loss of intellectual property and data rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government has good policies with regards to intellectual property, good procedures, but a lot of folks interpret these issues as complicated,&rdquo; says UD&rsquo;s Director of Strategic Initiatives Paul Schlottman.</p>
<p>Schlottman and AFRL attorney Sabra Tomb set out to simplify the concept, which had previously been tackled at a much higher level and didn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we give scientists and engineers the basics to be equipped to be knowledgeable enough to know how, if and when they have a potential invention, and when to collaborate with a technology transfer specialist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tomb says that involves teaching the following:</p>
<p>What forms to fill out</p>
<p>Who to talk to before sharing information</p>
<p>When to disclose</p>
<p>How to determine the timeline</p>
<p>When to talk to a technology transfer specialist</p>
<p>When to present the information to a patent attorney</p>
<p>&ldquo;We definitely went out of our way to find world-class experts from within the Air Force but also industry, and we took a great deal of effort to identify the specific knowledge and information that a scientist or engineer needed,&rdquo; says Schlottman.</p>
<p>Beta tests of the training have been overwhelmingly positive from government and private sector scientists and the new course is expected to start by the end of June.

<p><img src="https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png" alt="img">
The Supreme People&rsquo;s Court of China recently issued the Draft of &ldquo;The Supreme People&rsquo;s Court&rsquo;s Reply to the Law Application Concerning Network Intellectual Property Infringement Disputes&rdquo; (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;Draft&rdquo;) to seek for public comments. Compared with the E-commerce Law of China, the Draft clarifies that the court should make a timely judgement on the IP right owner&rsquo;s request on the content removal, and that both &ldquo;the network service provider&rdquo; and &ldquo;the operator of E-commerce platform&rdquo; have the obligation to take necessary measures such as deleting, blocking, or disconnecting relevant information in due time upon receipt of IP right owner&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>Full text of the Draft：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the IP right owner believes that its right has been infringed and thus submits a motion for preservation relief, requiring the network service provider or operator of E-commerce platform to promptly remove the relevant information, the People&rsquo;s Court shall hear the case in accordance with the law and make a timely judgement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a notice that was sent from the IP right owner in accordance with the law, if the network service provider or the operator of E-commerce platform fails to take necessary measures, such as deleting, blocking, or disconnecting relevant information in due time, it will be held jointly liable with the network user or the operator on the platform for the increased part of damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the content that the IP right owner requested to remove is inconsistent with the objective fact, but the IP right owner is able to prove that it has no subjective fault, the People&rsquo;s Court shall recognize that such notice does not constitute an unreal notice, and the civil liability shall not be borne due to such notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of the notice forwarded from the network service provider or operator of E-commerce platform, the network user or the operator on the platform may submit a statement to the network service provider or the operator of E-commerce platform that there exists no infringement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After receiving such statement, the network service provider or the operator of E-commerce platform shall forward the statement to the IP right owner who sent the notice, and inform the IP right owner of the opportunity to make complaints with the related authority or file a lawsuit with the People&rsquo;s Court. Where the network service provider or the operator of E-commerce platform does not receive any notice from the right owner that it has made a complaint or filed a lawsuit, within a reasonable period of time after the forwarded statement having been delivered to the IP right owner, it shall promptly lift all measures that it has been taken. The above mentioned statement shall include preliminary evidence that excludes the existence of any infringement and the true identity information of the network user.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Where a statement is maliciously submitted and thus causes the network service provider or the operator of E-commerce platform to lift the measures which causes an increased damage to the IP right owner, the People&rsquo;s Court may, as per the request of the IP right owner, increase the compensation liability of the person who made the malicious statement, for the increased part of the damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Reply shall apply to the cases where the final judgement had not been made when the Reply was issued. The Reply shall not apply to the cases where the final judgement had been made when the Reply was issued, nor the cases where the parties has applied for retrial or a retrial has been decided to take place in accordance with the trial supervision procedures.

<p><img src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2020/04/GettyImages-1209572715.jpg" alt="img">
Have you ever wondered what your rights are as an artist? There’s no clear-cut textbook to consult—but we’re here to help. Katarina Feder, a vice president at Artists Rights Society, is answering questions of all sorts about what kind of control artists have—and don’t have—over their work.</p>
<p>Do you have a query of your own? Email [email protected] and it may get answered in an upcoming article.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art apologize for posting images of Glenn Ligon’s work to their social-media feeds without his permission. I know that it was in support of Black Lives Matter, but once I heard they didn’t ask first, it struck me as wrong. Was it illegal as well?</p>
<p>Those two museums made a mistake, and as you pointed out, subsequently apologized.</p>
<p>For the most part—and this often comes as a surprise to people—museums don’t actually own the reproduction rights to works in their collection. The artist retains the underlying copyright to the work and any reproductions of it unless he or she agrees to sign it over (remember artists: don’t do it!).</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if the work is hanging in the home of a private collector, locked in a storage unit in Brooklyn, or displayed prominently on the walls of a famed institution. When a museum wants to post an image from their collection, they are almost always obligated to seek the artist’s permission.</p>
<p>On his own Instagram, Ligon responded to the wave of posts: “I know its #nationalreachouttoblackfolksweek but could y’all just stop. Or ask me first?”</p>
<p>It seems that institutions were allowing the work of this American legend to do the heavy lifting for them on a subject that they found challenging to address directly. (It’s worth noting that Ligon is often associated with a movement known as “post-black,” a term he helped coin, which aims to push back against the oversimplification of art and identity.)</p>
<p>We can all learn from this flub on the part of museums. Let’s do our best not to exploit, or even simplify, the life’s work of creators for a quick social-media fix. And if you’re uncomfortable asking for permission, maybe that means the post wasn’t such a good idea in the first place.</p>
<p>I want to ask about something that’s always bugged me about the “Blue Lives Matter” movement. How are its supporters able to appropriate the Punisher logo for those stickers you see on the backs of cars? In addition to the fact that it makes no sense, as the Punisher is a vigilante who’s job is to shirk, not uphold, the law, they seem to be messing with the copyright of an entity owned by the Walt Disney Corporation. How do they get away with it?</p>
<p>Whether the gruesome Punisher skull should be adopted by anyone, let alone the police, is a moral question we can get into later. Whether it can be adopted is a legal question I’ll tackle first.</p>
<p>The character of the Punisher was created by Gerry Conway, John Romita Sr., and Ross Andru in 1974 under the aegis of Marvel Comics, which owns the copyright and trademark rights to the character and the skull logo that emanated from it. (It was not customary for artists working for Marvel to retain copyrights to their work.)</p>
<p>This raises an obvious question: if Marvel owns the copyright, then why do we see infringements everywhere? The answer has to do with a very important aspect of copyright protection, and that is enforcement.</p>
<p>To address copyright enforcement, allow me to direct your attention to another iconic comic character: Bill Watterson’s Calvin, of Calvin and Hobbes fame.</p>
<p>Watterson’s creation was the subject of a shady 1990s pre-Instagram meme—a bumper sticker that pictured Calvin sporting a devilish grin and peeing on things that the car’s owner disapproved of. These were obvious knock-offs; Calvin never looked quite right and the image was in total opposition to the tone of Watterson’s comic strips, which was quite philosophical and soulful.</p>
<p>Because these decals were being produced and shared by hundreds of individuals across the country—and because Watterson never officially licensed Calvin’s image for merchandising—cease-and-desist letters amounted to a costly game of whack-a-mole. As a spokeswoman for United Press Syndicate, the company that distributed Calvin and Hobbes, explained in 1998, “When you license a character, then you increase the number of attorneys who keep a lookout and protect the images.”</p>
<p>This brings us back to Marvel and the Punisher. It would seem that at some point, Disney, which owns Marvel, did a cost-benefit analysis in terms of how much they might make off these lawsuits versus how much they’d spend to litigate them—not to mention what they might lose from boycotts of their movies by cop fans—and decided they could live with the infringement.</p>
<p>It is a real pity, however, that the Punisher has been adopted by those who have been tasked with upholding the law. The skull logo is reminiscent of the “Totenkopf,” a skull-and-crossbones symbol worn by the SS during the Second World War. When modern agents of authority wear it, one begins to question what ideals they’re protecting.</p>
<p>I make children’s books. I know I own the US copyright to a book I illustrated, but now the images are being sent to an ebook converter in India. How do I protect my art in countries outside the US? Does US copyright cover this?</p>
<p>Ah, children’s books. You absorb our drool and teach us to read. You inspire a love of literature that burns long into adulthood. Then we share these beloved stories with our own children… in the form of big-budget Hollywood films that pad out a 30-page book with, like, ten subplots.</p>
<p>Just as your copyright would be protected if your book were optioned into a movie, so it remains durable in its translation to ebooks and the Indian market.</p>
<p>On paper, India’s dedication to copyright is actually more rigorous than our own. The country joined the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the world’s most significant international copyright instrument, in 1928, well before the US followed suit in 1989. The Berne Convention has three underlying principles:</p>
<p>A member country must extend the same treatment it offers its own creators to citizens of other member countries. The convention requires member countries to adopt certain minimum standards for copyright protection. If the work in question has fallen out of copyright in its country of origin, it may be denied protection in a member country.</p>
<p>So how do you enforce your rights, which are particularly important for ebooks, which are frequently the victims of piracy? As an American creator, I would (perhaps unsurprisingly!) advise you to join Artists Rights Society, which has reciprocal relationships with more than 40 sister societies around the globe.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ARS has no sister society in India that I can direct you to, so I would recommend getting in touch with a local intellectual property lawyer to help you navigate the nuances of enforcement (which could cost a lot of $$$). With any luck, your ebook will become a massive smash and you will be able to reap the financial rewards. Does Bollywood do adaptations?</p>
<p>I just learned about this thing called the Projansky contract. What are the pros and cons of it? With all this money floating around the art market, why aren’t more artists using the Projansky contract or something like it?</p>
<p>If you care about making sure artists are paid, then the Projansky contract—sometimes called “The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement”—is indeed a wonderful thing. Basically, it’s a contract between the artist and the initial buyer that guarantees that 15 percent of any return on the work goes back to the artist after a resale. That means if an artist sells a painting for $30,000 with a Projansky contract attached, and the buyer resells it later for $100,000, the artist would net $10,500 (15 percent of the upside) from the deal.</p>
<p>The contract was created by the conceptual art dealer Seth Siegelaub and the lawyer Robert Projansky in 1971 in response to a series of high-profile auction sales including the Robert Scull collection, which absolutely blew people’s minds when it made $2.2 million. (Even with inflation, that would only be equivalent to $12.7 million today, so, yes, the market has grown a lot since then.)</p>
<p>The contract had a number of boosters, including the artist Hans Haacke. (Haacke, who still uses it today, added some additional terms, including that he had to approve loans to group exhibitions and that he could borrow any work for exhibitions of his choosing for 60 days out of every five years.)</p>
<p>Critics of the contract, meanwhile, say it hurts business. “The last thing I was interested in,’” artist Mel Bochner said of the Projansky contract, “was the formation of more bureaucracy, of another kind of art police.”</p>
<p>If the US government adopted a Federal Resale Royalty—a law, like those in place in some 80 countries worldwide, that requires a percentage of the resale price return to the artist—much of this discussion would be moot. Although an appeals court struck down a version of this law in California in 2018, ARS has co-authored a resale rights bill presently before Congress (but goodness knows they have a lot on their hands at the moment).</p>
<p>“We never expected this to become the standard of the art world, but we wanted to raise the subject and maybe influence some legislation,” Projansky himself told the New York Times in 1974. Here, here.</p>

<h3 id="vubiq-networks-protects-rfid-innovation-with-new-patent-publication-increasing-bit-density-and-lowering-costs-of-chipless-data-tags">&ldquo;Vubiq Networks Protects RFID Innovation with New Patent Publication, Increasing Bit Density and Lowering Costs of Chipless Data Tags&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20200623005108/en/686966/23/Vubiq-Networks-Logo-Orange-with-Tag.jpg" alt="img">
IRVINE, Calif.&ndash;(BUSINESS WIRE)&ndash;Vubiq Networks, Inc., the innovation leader in millimeter wave wireless broadband technology, products and solutions, today announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the World Intellectual Property Organization / Patent Cooperation Treaty (WIPO/PCT) have both published the company’s latest patent application entitled High Bit Density Millimeter Wave RFID Systems, Devices, and Methods Thereof. The U.S. Patent application has assigned publication number 0184161, while the WIPO/PCT has assigned publication number 118058.</p>
<p>The newly published patent application defines advanced, high-bit density chipless radio frequency identification (RFID) technology using the company’s innovative millimeter wave polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) hyperimaging techniques that incorporates polarization and phase detection. The new technology provides orders of magnitude higher bit density for RFID tags as compared to prior art or other competitive approaches.</p>
<p>“This new patent will provide additional worldwide protection for our RFID technology,” said Mike Pettus, founder and CTO of Vubiq Networks. “Our technology exploits the natural physics of antennas at a tremendously small scale. The result is a chipless RFID data tag that approaches the cost of printing a bar code, but with the ability to contain hundreds of data bits on the size of a postage stamp.”</p>
<p>The comprehensive patent application includes “reduction to practice” by addressing both hardware and software applications. It provides for very high density chipless tag data encoding through the use of innovative geometrical layout of the patch antennas as the tag elements. The technology provides for reduced optimized element spacing, providing very high bit density for chipless RFID.</p>
<p>“Utilizing our innovative POLSAR technology, not only can the high-density data be retrieved from the tag, but also physically located,” explained Vubiq CEO John Dilworth. “Our millimeter wave hyperimaging technology can read tags through materials such as cardboard, pill bottles, and envelopes. This breakthrough approach significantly reduces costs, while providing performance advantages and features not available with existing solutions.”</p>
<p>Additional RFID patents and patent applications held by Vubiq Networks include:</p>
<p>US Patent Number 7460014, issued December 2, 2008 – RFID System Utilizing Parametric Reflective Technology.</p>
<p>US Patent Number 7498940, issued March 3, 2009 – RFID System Utilizing Parametric Reradiated Technology.</p>
<p>US Patent Application 62746829, submitted October 17, 2018 – Multimode Millimeter Wave RFID Systems and Methods Thereof.</p>
<p>The increased data density and lower tag costs associated with this new technology are important developments for the burgeoning RFID marketplace, especially for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The current $11 billion RFID market is expected to explode to $40 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>“The reduced size and costs of new radar chip technology hitting the market today will enable our RFID technology to be integrated in low-cost handheld devices, and even in smartphones like the recent introduction by Google,” said Mr. Dilworth. “This could potentially lead to smartphones incorporating RFID tag readers based on our POLSAR technology.’</p>

<p><img src="https://images1.calcalist.co.il/PicServer3/2018/05/28/820218/8_l.jpg" alt="img">
Video games have seen a surge in popularity during the recent coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, soaring to almost $11 billion in U.S. sales during the first quarter of 2020. Analysts see this growth as related to the “comfort and connection” that video games bring to a growing community of millions during a challenging time like the Covid-19 crisis, but that’s not all video games can bring.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first prescription video game , Akili Interactive Labs Inc.’s EndeavorRX, for children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
<p>AI (Illustration). Photo: Shutterstock</p>
<p>The game, which is currently only available on Apple devices, went through seven years of clinical testing with over 600 patients before its approval. The software seems to work and the company boasts a study, which states that one-third of kids treated &ldquo;no longer had a measurable attention deficit on at least one measure of objective attention after playing the obstacle-dodging, target-collecting game for 25 minutes a day, five days a week for four weeks.”</p>
<p>Beyond this new foray into medicine, video games are also seeking other ways to add to their increasingly huge quarterly hauls. One recent innovation seeks a new way to monetize advertising in gaming, beyond the standard product placements. Vancouver-headquartered Versus Systems Inc., in partnership with tech giant HP, has created a new way to gamify games, by allowing gaming enthusiasts to play for real-world sponsored prizes in virtual environments.</p>
<p>But even as video games find ever-increasing ways to appreciate in value, the ability to protect this increasingly valuable and profitable form of intellectual property may be getting weaker, ironically, because the games are getting better through greater incorporation of artificial intelligence , especially during the creative process.</p>
<p>As discussed in a previous column , under U.S. copyright law, it is unclear whether artificial intelligence can be considered an author, a foundational requirement for copyright protection. The U.S. and the European Union&rsquo;s patent laws already disallow AI technologies from being legally considered inventors, which does not bode well for AI authorship in terms of copyright. If an AI is part of the creative process in developing a video game, such as in creating realistic 3D images and videos , its contributions to the game would likely not be protected.</p>
<p>But all might not be lost. U.S. Copyright law, like many other jurisdictions, has a work-for-hire doctrine. Succinctly this rule vests copyright authorship in the corporate employer in cases where the employee creates a copyrightable work in the course of their employment. In this case, American copyright law uses the common-law understanding of employee which could conceivably encompass an AI machine. To wit, we already have labor laws for other non-human employees, namely animals</p>
<p>If an AI can serve as an employee in the eyes of copyright law, then the work-for-hire doctrine could create a potentially copyrightable work regardless as to whether an AI can be a legal author. However, this workaround depends on the exact logic of the doctrine. In particular, the mechanics of this doctrine could conceivably take one of two separate tracks. The law may be outcome dependent, that is, focused on whether the resulting work is simply copyrightable, within the ‘ambit of copyright’, or it might be action-dependent in that it may require that a work is first actually copyrighted and only then can the employer step into the employee’s shoes and obtain copyright. In the former track, the law could be sufficiently bent to provide copyright protection regardless of the AI nature of the author, in the latter, it is less likely.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the gaming industry may have yet another beef with the copyright system. Earlier, this month, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the trade association for the American recording industry, infamous for its abusive tactics against geriatrics and teens, submitted thousands of take-down notices to Twitch, a popular Amazon-owned streaming platform primarily for gamers who record their gameplay, for the copyright infringement of popular music sequences that often play in the background.</p>
<p>Reportedly, due to the lack of concert opportunities during the current pandemic, artists are turning to online alternatives, like the aforementioned Twitch platform, to monetize their music. The fact that gamers have, until now, made this music freely available in the background of their gameplay makes it harder for the recording artists to monetize their wares, explaining the legal actions</p>
<p>Gaming is not the only recent case that is forcing us to reassess copyright law in light of new realities. In another case , makeup artist Sammy Mourabit claimed that his makeup work on actress Juliette Lewis for a fashion shoot was misappropriated by Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido Co. Ltd., which used a photo from the shoot in an advertisement for its makeup line.</p>
<p>However, while the appellate court recognized that the painted face itself could fall within what it termed the &ldquo;broad ambit&rdquo; of copyright, it would not rule on whether human skin could fulfill the statutory requirement that a copyrighted work be fixed on a tangible medium. This ambit of copyright may be broad enough to encompass the copyrightable works developed by AI, as described above.</p>
<p>Lower courts, however, have agreed, in the past, to rule on the medium of skin in copyright and the matter has also been discussed in a previous column regarding the copyright issues surrounding tattoos. In a legal precedent, earlier this month, a New York federal district court ruled that tattoo licensing company Solid Oak Sketches LLC could not claim copyright infringement on the portrayal of their tattoos on NBA basketball players, including LeBron James, in the hyper-realistic video game NBA 2K.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the tattoo artist was the author of a copyrighted work, namely the player’s tattoos, the judge still ruled that the use of the tattoos in the video game itself was not an infringement, for, among other reasons, it was de minimis and did not suffice to reach the level of use necessary to trigger an infringement.</p>
<p>However, what might be an infringement of the tattoo artists’ copyright, albeit a stretch, is the after-market modification of a tattoo. In particular, this could be a violation of the tattoo artist’s moral rights or an artist’s right to create derivative works. This is a conceivably growing concern now more than ever as the current civil rights protests have woken people to the potential micro-aggressions, overt racism, or association with Harry Potter author JK Rowling depicted in their tattoos, driving them to actively alter them to less offensive imagery.</p>
<p>Fortunately, courts will likely not uphold infringement here, as enforcing such rights would be in contradistinction to constitutional protections of freedom and personal autonomy, the same freedom and autonomy that lets us sit at home all day and consume billions of dollars in video games.</p>

<h3 id="client-alert-protecting-intellectual-property-in-remote-based-work-settings">&ldquo;Client Alert: Protecting Intellectual Property in Remote-Based Work Settings&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7704_5251.jpg" alt="img">
During the COVID-19 pandemic, teleworking has become both a requirement and a preference to facilitate a safe and healthy workplace. However, remote-based work settings may pose intentional and unintentional threats to intellectual property (IP) and other proprietary information or technology.</p>
<p>For example, work is increasingly conducted from home office spaces, wherein easier access to IP may be given to persons (i.e., family, residents, visitors, and others in close proximity) not privy to the IP. Virtual meetings may also increase the possibility of undesired exposure to data, ideas, creations, reports, and the like that are meant to remain secret. Maintaining secrecy is one of the core principals or requirements for various types and aspects of IP. Additionally, certain policies, urgent matters, or company routines pertaining to IP may be adhered to in a more lax manner. Therefore, the following practices are recommended to minimize theft of proprietary information and other IP-related issues resulting from an increase in remote work.</p>
<p>Identify Your Valuable IP</p>
<p>It is important to inventory and evaluate your IP not only to determine a monetary worth thereof, but also to determine what to protect, how to protect it, and from whom to protect it. Prioritizing your IP through an analysis, such as a risk-cost-benefit analysis, assists in determining the level of protection the IP demands. The four main types of IP are as follows:</p>
<p>PATENTS are new, non-obvious, and useful inventions such as machines, processes, consumer products, ornamental designs, or compositions of matter.</p>
<p>Examples: light bulb, process for assembling vehicles, ornamental design of a watch.</p>
<p>TRADEMARKS are brands and logos (i.e., words or designs), colors, and sounds to identify goods and services from a particular source. The symbols “TM” and “®” are typically associated with trademarks.</p>
<p>Examples: Apple® for smart devices, the “golden arches” for McDonald’s fast food restaurants, the color brown for UPS delivery services.</p>
<p>COPYRIGHTS are creative expressions of ideas in tangible form.</p>
<p>Examples: software and codes, webpage or application, literature, videos, sculptures, paintings, pictures, music compositions.</p>
<p>TRADE SECRETS are any valuable information that gives you a competitive advantage that is maintained in secret.</p>
<p>Examples: formulas, recipes, processes, customer lists, algorithm for search engines, financial data, marketing plans, R&amp;D materials.</p>
<p>Recognize the Threats</p>
<p>In remote-based work settings during a sudden onset of a pandemic, employees may be unsupervised, an urgency of work priorities may decrease, a free-flow of information is increased, and employer policies and training regarding IP may be neglected or rushed. The following is a list of key threats to IP rights:</p>
<p>Theft of IP by phishers and hackers taking advantage of the COVID-19 crisis at-home workers, especially those using personal devices and/or network connections that are not secure.</p>
<p>Inadvertent disclosure of secret information is easier with family, visitors, and the public at large, as well as through video conferencing and teleconferencing. For example, laptops may be unattended, printed documents are freely laid out in the open or lost, smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echo device, smart phones, or home security cameras may record conversations, visitors or the public may hear conversations either in the employee’s remote-based work space or the remote-based work space of those the employee is conferencing with, and IP, especially trade secrets, may not be properly designated, labeled, or electronically stored as confidential/proprietary.</p>
<p>Loss of IP ownership rights may increase if responsibilities of employees in remote-based work settings are not clearly defined. Employers generally own the IP created by its employees in the course and scope of their employment. Therefore, an employee could gain independent ownership of IP if the course and scope of employment is vaguely defined.</p>
<p>Limited resources, capabilities, and communication resulting from working remotely could lead to an inability to meet IP obligations. For example, difficulties may arise in maintaining IP license agreement provisions, failure in properly enforcing IP infringement matters, losing the ability to file and register IP and meet deadlines, and rushing IP R&amp;D to meet the pandemic demands without focusing on IP terms may occur if communication and capabilities are reduced.</p>
<p>Not maintaining a brand’s positive image and ensuring continuous proper use of a trademark can occur.</p>
<p>Protecting Against the Threat</p>
<p>The following proactive measures can help reduce threats to IP in remote-based settings:

<p>Patent Filings Rebound After Virus Halted Work</p>
<p>From January to April, the number of patent applications on the Chinese mainland was 1.32 million, an increase of 5.7% year-on-year. Wherein, the number of patent applications in February dropped by 33.2% compared with the same period in 2019. But it rebounded quickly in March, with a year-on-year growth of 10.5%. In April, the growth rate accelerated to 15.7%.</p>
<p>An 8.1% increase in patent filings by domestic enterprises was observed in the first four months of 2020. Out of the 65,000 enterprises on the Chinese mainland that applied for invention patents, about 29,000 are in high-tech industries, accounting for 44.6%.</p>
<p>The number of patent filings by domestic pharmaceutical and medical enterprises grew faster still. Around 9,000 invention patents were filed between January and April, up 8.4% year-on-year and 9% points higher than the overall growth rate.</p>
<p>The new-generation information technology sector was also a driving force behind the growth. Its proportion to the total domestic filings of invention patents increased by 1.8% points during those four months, compared with the same period of 2019.</p>
<p>Telecommunication giant Huawei and internet company Tencent reported a 35.2% and 178.9% surge in invention patent applications, respectively.</p>

<p>Financing Via Pledging IPs Booms in China in First Quarter</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2020, patent and trademark pledge financing grossed 33.7 billion yuan, up 15.5%, and the number of pledge items reached 1,633, up 13.8%, revealed at a press conference of China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), summarizing tremendous growth in both number of projects and value of loans during the period mostly hit by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Plenty of more mature patterns of IP pledge financing has been explored and the efficiency of the transfer and use of IP has been enhanced year by year. According to the statistics released by CNIPA, in 2019, patent transfer, licensing and pledge are done 307,000 times, up 21.3%; the total number of patent and trademark pledge financing logged at 151.5 billion yuan, up 23.8%; the transaction volume of IP-related technology contracts amounted to 928.69 billion yuan, up 137.7%.</p>

<p>EU Businesses Recognize Marked Improvement in IP Legislation and Enforcement in China</p>
<p>On June 10, the European Union (EU) Chamber of Commerce in China, in cooperation with Roland Berger, released its European Business in China Business Confidence Survey 2020.</p>
<p>The report reveals that IP protection has long been among major concerns for European companies operating in China or looking to enter the market. When it comes to the impact of IPR on R&amp;D, two-thirds of respondents rate the effectiveness of China&rsquo;s IP protection laws and regulations as either &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; or &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Statistics showed that China has seen marked improvement in both IP legislation and enforcement, which is the highest rate of positive sentiment since 2012.</p>
<p>The survey inquired 1,308 eligible entities, with 626 respondents completing the survey, and achieved a response rate of 47.9%.</p>

<p>SUPPLEMENTARY ISSUE</p>
<p>A Brief on SPC&rsquo;s Drafted Provisions on Several Issues Concerning the Hearing of Administrative Cases on the Granting of Patent Rights (I)</p>
<p>The Provisions is about law application in administrative lawsuits against patent validity issues, i.e. those brought by a patent applicant against a decision on reexamination or by a patentee/petitioner against a decision on invalidation declaration.</p>
<p>The provisions in the current Draft assemble unsettled issues observed in recent years, such as assessment of inventive step, lack of support, insufficient disclosure, post-filing experimental data, design examination, etc. The Draft provides additional explanations or guidance to the application of patent law in administrative lawsuits to help unify judicial standards and standardize judicial acts.</p>
<p>On the procedural side, the Draft sets forth treatments to violations of statutory procedures, manners of sentencing, rules of evidence, etc.</p>
<p>Among them, Article 24 clarifies that the petitioner who is entitled to request to declare a design patent invalid should not be limited to a prior legal right owner or interested party, resolving the misunderstanding occurred in current practice.</p>
<p>In addition, it is worth noting that Article 28, which is intended to curtail the working flow, specifies that if the court finds that the reasons to invalidate the claims in the decision at issue are untenable, it shall revoke or partially revoke the decision without requesting the CNIPA to make a new invalidation on the claim(s).</p>
<p>The Draft also reflects China&rsquo;s determination to continuously improve the environment of patent protection. For example, Article 5 provides the legal consequence if a patent applicant or patentee violates the good-faith principle by falsifying or fabricating the technical contents in a patent application. This will be conducive to curbing abnormal applications and improving the quality of patents.</p>
<p>It is noted that the Provisions are scheduled to be formally introduced in August 2020.</p>
<p>Full text of the Draft in Chinese can be found at</p>

<p>Court Supports FAULHABER by Revoking Eponymous TM Squatted by Ex-business Partner</p>
<p>Recently, progress has been made in the dispute between the German company DR.FRITZ FAULHABER GMBH&amp;CO.KG (FAULHABER) and ASIMEN TECHNOLOGY (HK) CO., LIMITED (ASIMEN). Beijing High People&rsquo;s Court upheld FAULHABER&rsquo;s claim and held that the No. 10791093 &ldquo;FAULHABER&rdquo; trademark (the trademark in dispute) registered by ASIMEN Company and the No. G735551 &ldquo;Faulhaber&rdquo; trademark and No. G1032589 &ldquo;FAULHABER &amp; Figure&rdquo; trademark &quot; (the reference marks) constitute similar trademarks used on similar goods, rejecting the decision of upholding the registration of the trademark in dispute made by the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board (TRAB) under the former State Administration of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>The trademark in dispute was submitted for registration by ASIMEN Company on April 18, 2012, certified to be used on Class 7 goods such as electronic industrial equipment and electrostatic industrial equipment on July 28, 2015,with the exclusive right valid from June 28, 2013 to June 27, 2023. FAULHABER lodged an invalidation request of the trademark in dispute on September 18, 2015, asserting that the trademark in dispute is similar with its previously registered reference trademark while being used on similar goods, and the registration of the trademark in dispute by ASIMEN constitutes the situation squatting the trademark that has been used and has a certain influence by improper means provided in Article 32 of the Chinese Trademark Law; in addition, there was a business relationship between ASIMEN and FAULHABER. Therefore, its application for registration of the trademark in dispute violates Article 15 of the Chinese Trademark Law.</p>
<p>On May 24, 2016, the former TRAB upheld the registration of the trademark in dispute, holding that the trademark in dispute and the reference trademarks are not similar marks used on similar goods. FAULHABER then brought the case to Beijing IP Court. The IP Court later held the goods on which the trademark certified to be used belong to an entire industrial machine while the goods on which the reference mark certified to be used are machine parts. These marks differ greatly in function, use, production department, sales channel, consumption target and the relevant public generally do not think that there is a specific association which is easy to cause confusion, so the trademark in dispute and the reference trademarks are not similar marks used on similar goods; the goods sold in China by FAULHABER before the registration date of the trademark in dispute are not the same or similar goods as the goods on which the trademark in dispute certified to be used , so the registration of the trademark in dispute does not violate Articles 32 and 15 of the Chinese Trademark Law. In this connection, the trial Court rejected FAULHABER&rsquo;s claims on November 26, 2018.</p>
<p>FAULHABER refused to buy the first- instance judgment and then appealed to Beijing High People&rsquo;s Court. Beijing High held that the goods on which the trademark in dispute certified to be used are the same or have certain association with the goods on which the reference trademarks are certified to be used in terms of function, use, production department. Meanwhile, taking into account the similarity of the trademark in dispute and the reference trademarks and that there is a business relationship between FAULHABER and ASIMEN before the registration of the trademark in dispute, the subjective intention of registering the trademark in dispute cannot be regarded as justified. If the trademark in dispute and the reference trademarks are allowed to co-exist in the marketplace, the relevant public may easily confuse the source of the goods, so these marks constituted similar trademarks used on similar goods. In this connection, Beijing High revoked the first- instance judgment and the original TRAB decision.</p>
<p><a href="http://english.ipraction.gov.cn/article/tc/202006/315077.html">http://english.ipraction.gov.cn/article/tc/202006/315077.html</a></p>
<p>Beijing High Awards VOLVO Well-known Mark, Upending Free Rider</p>
<p>VOLVO is a well-known automobile brand from Sweden. After finding a Shenzhen- based telecom company&rsquo;s VOVO trademark similar to its own, the Swedish company waged a nullity war.</p>
<p>According to a recent decision made by Beijing High People&rsquo;s Court, Shenzhen Lingjuli Communication Technology Company&rsquo;s No.10443545 VOVO trademark (the trademark in dispute ) is found similar with VOLVO&rsquo;s No.1981782 VOLVO, No.5102989 VOLVO and its figure (the cited trademarks) when used on the same or similar products. In this connection, the Court rejected Lingjuli&rsquo;s appeal, and upheld the decision invalidating the registration of the trademark in dispute made by the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board (TRAB) under former State Administration of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>According to files, Lingjuli filed the application for registration of the trademark in dispute on January 19, 2012, requesting certified to be used on Class 9 products including notebooks and other products.</p>
<p>On June 2, 2016, VOLVO lodged an invalidation request to the former TRAB asserting that the trademark in dispute is similar with the cited trademarks while being used on the same or similar products. On December 30, 2016, TRAB nullified the trademark in dispute.</p>
<p>Lingjuli then brought the case to Beijing IP Court, arguing that there is no similarity between the contending marks for differences in character combination and pronunciation. In addition, the cited trademarks have not been used actually by VOLVO on certified products, therefore the registration of the trademark in dispute would not cause confusion among the relevant public.</p>
<p>Beijing IP Court held that there exist significant differences between the trademark in dispute and the cited trademarks in overall visual effects, so similarity was not constituted. In parallel, the evidence showed that although VOLVO had enjoyed high reputation on automobiles, VOLVO had not yet used the cited trademarks on certified products. So the relevant public would distinguish between them because they had already known the VOLVO mark. In this connection, the Court revoked the decision made by the TRAB, and ordered it to make a de novo decision.</p>
<p>The disgruntled VOLVO then appealed to Beijing High People&rsquo;s Court. After hearing, the appellate court held that the trademark in dispute and the cited trademarks only differ by one measly letter, while they also are similar in character combination and pronunciation. So the similarity was constituted under the general examination standard. The court of the first instance ruled that VOLVO mark enjoyed high reputation on automobile products. Conversely, the IP Court held the relevant public may distinguish between the trademark in dispute and the cited trademarks. This is the wrong application of the established examination rules and shall be rectified. In this connection, Beijing High made the decision in favor of VOLVO.</p>

<p>Beijing IP Court Denies Infringement Claims of RIMOWA in Suitcase Decoration Dispute</p>
<p>Beijing IP Court made a final judgment on a suitcase decoration dispute between RIMOWA GmbH, a Germany-based company, and a person surnamed Duan, denying all of claims of RIMOWA.</p>
<p>Kofferfabrik Paul Morszeck, the predecessor company of RIMOWA specialized in manufacturing suitcases, was established in Cologne, Germany in 1898 and changed its name to RIMOWA in 1941, manufacturing suitcases designed with grooved stripes and a combination of five unique decoration design elements including cornerite, metal strip, rivet and locked groove.</p>
<p>In 2014, RIMOWA found that the suitcases sold by Duan, a person from China, copied its products in overall silver appearance and multiple design details. RIMOWA sued at Beijing Dongcheng District People&rsquo;s Court on the grounds that Duan infringed its unique decoration right and breached unfair competition rules, requesting the court to order Duan to stop selling the alleged infringing products, publish a statement and remove ill effects and indemnify 150,000 yuan in damages and 50,000 yuan in reasonable costs.</p>
<p>Duan argued that the suitcases manufactured by RIMOWA do not belong to well- known goods and its elevated grooves design is not unique. The evidence RIMOWA provided cannot prove that its suitcases are famous in China and familiar to the relevant public. In addition, RIMOWA&rsquo;s suitcases cannot play a role in distinguishing the source of goods. Therefore, the suitcases sold by her cannot cause confusion among the relevant public.</p>
<p>Dongcheng Court held that the decoration of both RIMOWA&rsquo;s and Duan&rsquo;s suitcases&rsquo; are comprised of the five design elements of the elevated- grooves design and there are some similar features. In addition, RIMOWA&rsquo;s suitcases are well-known in China and familiar to the relevant public, belonging to the famous goods provided in the Chinese Anti- Unfair Competition Law. There exists competition between RIMOWA and Duan. Accordingly, Dongcheng Court made a first- instance judgment, ordering an injunction, 70,000 yuan in damages and reasonable costs.</p>
<p>Duan then brought the case to Beijing IP Court.</p>
<p>After hearing, Beijing IP Court held that the relevant public will not relate the decoration of suitcases with certain product providers. On top of that, it cannot be determined that Duan sold the alleged suitcases in bad faith nor be proved that the act of Duan constituted unfair competition. Besides, the evidence cannot prove the suitcases manufactured by RIMOWA are well- known among the relevant public. In the connection, Beijing IP Court revoked the first- instance judgement and denied all of claims of RIMOWA.</p>
