<p>Diana Ross’s songs, including the staples “I’m Coming Out” and “Love Hangover,” have placed her among a pantheon of soul divas whose work transcends genre and time. In the past two and a half years, fans both new and old have been reminded of her lasting appeal as remixes of four of the singer’s biggest hits have topped Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart.</p>
<p>Remixed by prolific producer Eric Kupper, “Love Hangover 2020,” “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough 2017,” “I’m Coming Out/Upside Down 2018” and “The Boss 2019” all landed at&hellip;

At best, at the very best, the RFU is coming across as patronising. It is reviewing (this must be music to the ears of the prime minister as his government is extremely good at reviews) the song Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by looking into its “historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions” to decide whether this spiritual anthem from the American Deep South should remain Twickenham’s choice of song.</p>
<p>Jerusalem is another song in need of a few explanatory programme notes. It is not the patriotic lung-buster many believe it to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Swing Low. Songs do evolve and, overall, that is a good thing. As I wrote in 2017, if 1 per cent of the predominantly white,

<h3 id="blm-and-the-fallacy-of-celebrating-diversity-in-the-eurovision-song-contest">&ldquo;BLM and the fallacy of ‘celebrating diversity’ in the Eurovision Song Contest&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/escxtra.com/wp-content/uploads/Jedward-1.jpg?fit=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
This has been an incredibly painful few weeks. Attempting to crystallise my thoughts has been equally painful. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests has prompted a broader discussion of the ideas of privilege and a reappraisal of popular culture. It has also unearthed some toxic and problematic mindsets in a number of individuals within the fandom. Of course, for a handful of us, we already had a hunch…</p>
<p>BLM within the Eurovision fandom</p>
<p>We need to be prepared for uncomfortable conversations and questions. These discussions are thought-provoking, eye-opening and enriching… but they are also hard.</p>
<p>It is difficult to explain to colleagues and peers why they might be allocated more privilege than someone else. To illuminate systematic inequality, or the violence that has knowingly or unknowingly occurred through our language or actions. Similarly, it is difficult recognising that you may enjoy systemic privileges over others, the stages of privileged racial identity development. It is equally difficult to relive the violence of racism to those who ‘don’t get it’ over and over to try and help them understand. I hope the widespread peaceful protests of BLM leads to positive change and enables these conversations. I also hope that the BLM movement will also allow for other marginalised groups in society to get an opportunity to recenter themselves in public discourse. As much as it is naive to suggest there is a singular ‘black’ experience, there is also a multiplicity of lived experiences which must be listened to if we want to achieve an equal society.</p>
<p>The Eurovision fandom, like the many acts that participate, are a melting pot of cultures, experiences and opinions. However, it is the responsibility of fan sites like ours to help shape and carve narratives of inclusivity – especially regarding identity. We have a social and moral responsibility to our readers, the acts we discuss and each other.</p>
<p>Performative optics</p>
<p>It is imperative we all collectively use our respective platforms to ensure we practice what we preach. We are not infallible. Dialogues, discussions and debates need to be had to ensure an ethical framework is built to ensure our beloved contest retains the moral principles it was initially founded on. That isn’t to say mistakes won’t be made. Dialogues and discourses change at a rapid pace and it is our responsibility to ensure we are on top of the often intersectional discussions of best practice. However, admitting a mistake and genuinely learning from it (rather than tokenistic lip service with no meaningful change) is the only way to grow and develop. We need to respect culture and the multiplicity of lived experience: celebrate diversity.</p>
<p>Remember that slogan? I do. Three years on, have we as a fandom managed to see that concept into fruition? Personally, I’m not so sure…</p>
<p>When the hosts to Kyiv 2017 were revealed, many made comments and/or jokes like Graham Norton’s commentary. Quite obviously, three white men is not ‘diverse’. However, this cognitive dissonance is emblematic of so much more than a punchline or gag from a commentators booth. It raises some poignant questions:</p>
<p>Was there ever an answer to how three white men embody the celebration of diversity?</p>
<p>Was the slogan successfully implemented? Where, exactly?</p>
<p>Almost more importantly, did anyone think to ask that question to the EBU and/or organisers in the first place?</p>
<p>These questions are somewhat rhetorical – I’m sure some did question the contradiction. But that ‘some’ needs to be ‘all’.</p>
<p>The below video covers the many tropes of white privilege.</p>
<p>Visibility and temporality</p>
<p>One thing to help diversify the platforms to which the fandom thrives off of is representation. Visibility is key. It may not immediately ‘fix’ the issues many of us see in the fandom, but it does provide a platform to be heard. ESC Insight have set up a brilliant initiative. Similarly, we at ESCXTRA are also looking for new contributors. I implore those who identify as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) to consider joining a site and getting your voices heard.</p>
<p>That said, it should not be the sole responsibility of BIPOC to discuss these issues exclusively. Often the voices of allies – especially in this case white folks – using their privilege have the strongest chance to help dismantle systematic discrimination.</p>
<p>Indeed, ‘visibility’ is not just having a more diverse team on fan sites. Instead, visibility is the active and regular consideration and/or discussion of issues that directly impact those who are typically marginalised.</p>
<p>Racism did not end with the abolition of slaves. Similarly, racism will not end if and when the family of George Floyd get some form of justice for his death. The black tile or ‘temporary’ profile picture posted on social media to show solidarity as part of Blackout Tuesday? Well, unlike the temporary notion of a single post drawing attention to systemic wrongs for 24hrs, racism did not dissipate when the clock struck midnight and #BlackoutTuesday ended.</p>
<p>I welcome the articles by fan sites that have covered race, racism and the BLM movement. However, these pieces should not be a one-off tokenistic articles to say to ourselves ‘we covered racism’ and pat ourselves on the back. They shouldn’t be ill-thought rushed pieces to try and naively tap into the global outcry for some additional clicks. That’s a cheap, tacky tactic that is tone deaf as it is exploitative. It should be the start of a bigger conversation.</p>
<p>I hear some of you suggest fan sites covering race and particularly BLM is ‘too political‘. The plight for equality is a basic right of humanity. To suggest the existence of black people, or any other type of person, is ‘too political‘ is to suggest that section of society are somehow not worthy of basic human rights. That in itself is a trope of racism.</p>
<p>There is only one race: the human race. Jane Elliott</p>
<p>You may read the above and think ‘surely all lives matter‘ – well yes they do. However, the below cartoon explains why that analogy just doesn’t work:</p>
<p>Why ‘All Lives Matter’ is a fallacy</p>
<p>Micro-aggressions, the fandom and violence</p>
<p>As Costa has recently outlined, the BLM movement and racism is not an exclusively ‘American’ issue. Far from it. I’ve seen tinges of racism, intolerance and ignorance from many corners of the fandom, including some pretty close to home. The concerns of black fans in relation to how fan sites have covered race is not ‘ridiculous‘ or ‘too political‘ or something to be ‘ignored‘. We would all agree that if a homophobic or ableist slur was knowingly or unknowingly made, it would be right to call it out. However, it seems qwhite interesting that this moral compass doesn’t seem to extend to the sensibilities of BIPOC.</p>
<p>You only need to watch this experiment that took part in the UK a decade ago to recognise how racism thrives by not listening, challenging societal structures of white privilege to be an effective ally.</p>
<p>The one thing we cannot and must not do is refuse to ‘read the room’. Ignore the writing on the wall and ignore the global outcry for change. Instead, every single one of us needs to take a reflective moment to learn and educate ourselves on how aspects of identity might have impacted our engagement and reception of the Eurovision Song Contest. It could be a book, article, a Youtube video. Dipping into the materials provided by the BLM movement to understand the macro and micro-aggressions of simply existing. How might these experiences mimic or reflect those of an act, songwriter or performer – who put a brave face on for those precious three minutes on stage? Although I hope no act/performer has been subject to abuse, problematic statements or micro-aggressions, I’m all too aware many have been subject to violence.</p>
<p>Violence sounds like an odd word, to some extent it is. However, this word is intentional. It attempts to capture a spectrum of meanings and implications that is caused systematic inequality, the hangover from colonialism and (in)direct prejudice. It also means trivialising the existence of a group of people within society. The dismissal of voices trying to speak truth to power. The trivialising of concerns, upset, trauma or anger. It’s all too easy to do harm without realising the implications and impact of our words and actions.</p>
<p>Best practise moving forward?</p>
<p>As inspiring as this wave of BLM based activism has been, we all need to ensure this conversation doesn’t fizzle out. To stop writing about systemic inequality, privilege and the insidious nature of discrimination is to whitewash the issue. The pun there is both intentional and a stark reminder of what happens when we don’t keep talking about this issue.</p>
<p>Costa has previously outlined what we as a site can do and you as readers. A social contract of sorts. Essentially – don’t be racist.</p>
<p>But what positives steps might we take? What micro-aggressions can be stopped immediately? Here are a few suggestions, though they are just that – suggestions. Things to contribute to a broader discussion within the fandom.</p>
<p>DON’T: Describe a specific soundscape as ‘ethnic’ or ‘world music’</p>
<p>Is there a more precise term to reflect what we hear?</p>
<p>What do we mean by these terms and how might they assimilate/blur distinct cultures – eroding their individuality?</p>
<p>Rather than homogenise all non-traditional Western sounds – we should instead take the time to educate ourselves in another culture. More often than not, acts who integrate part of their cultural and musical heritage are more than happy to openly discuss the instrumentation, beats, style or elements that have been fused to make a soundscape. Use their words/language as a guide!</p>
<p>Prior to becoming a fan of the contest, how many knew what a Portuguese fado sounded like? The typical traits of schlager or what white voice sounds like? How long did it take to learn this terminology? Probably no time at all!</p>
<p>So, why can we not apply that yearning for knowledge of soundscapes beyond the loose boundaries of ‘Europe’ in the Eurovision Song Contest? A few moments to learn about a musical culture is part of why we love Eurovision, so why not expand this love further? It is often the case fan-sites are rushing to report breaking news and shortcuts are often used to get something published quickly. However, this can create a clunky echo-chamber, erasing the nuance of national identity, musicality under the increasingly clunky term ‘ethnic‘ or even more strained ‘world music‘. An op-ed article by The Guardian explains why these terms need to be queried and dumped.</p>
<p>With Hassan K, we talked about how the designation &lsquo;world Music&rsquo; for anything that centres non-Western performers was definitely quite racist. — Dr Ellie (@ellie_made) May 24, 2019</p>
<p>DON’T: Dismiss the voices and perspectives of BIPOC.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, BLM activism has prompted a reappraisal of popular culture and calling out micro-aggressions within the music and media we readily consume. Recent revelations of X Factor semi-finalist Misha B represent the human impact of these comments and the damage of racialised narratives. The trauma and damage inflicted on artists who wish to share their craft is very real: it is something we must fight against.</p>
<p>It’s a common talking point to suggest this is merely ‘playing the race card’ – but that in itself is a micro-aggression. As Afua Hirsch convincingly argues, the phrase is not only deeply racist but intended to silence, threaten or shame a BIPOC’s experience to a ‘subaltern’ state. Instead, listen to constructive feedback!</p>
<p>How often do we consider how these tropes might impact an act on a daily basis. From national final, to promo tours, rehearsals, local and international media and the performance itself?</p>
<p>Tired of hearing about race/racism? Imagine how tired the people are who experience it on a daily basis. To say you ‘don’t see colour’ is to demonstrate a freedom and privilege many BIPOC people do not have.</p>
<p>Your words and actions have an impact. What may seem like a harmless quip to you can be incredibly triggering and damaging. A seemingly sassy or intentionally antagonistic/provocative comment can have a lasting impact and feed into systemic tropes of violence. These comments chip away and diminish the self-worth of an individual. They invalidate your being. They make you want to hide in a void. They hurt. These statements may feel flippant when they are said or posted, but cause a lasting wound for the recipient. Simply put, they fuel and perpetuate white supremacy.</p>
<p>We can, should and must do better.</p>
<p>DO: be aware of the struggles an act may have endured during the Eurovision process</p>
<p>A little bit of homework goes a long way. Read up on the issue(s) before forming an opinion. Consider how an act may have been shaped or abused by local media before they even step foot on stage. Aminata, for example, received a torrent of racist bile after winning Supernova back in 2015. Recent testimonies from singers, such as Alexandra Burke, demonstrate how the music industry can proactively attempt to erode signifiers of your cultural identity.</p>
<p>The selection of Benny Cristo this year was exciting – especially given how the 2020 season was often dubbed as having ‘too many ballads’. Yet, the singer received a deluge of abuse from the fandom on social media. You might be asking ‘how do you know it was the Eurovision fandom‘? Great question! I doubt many Czech folk would send racially charged abuse to a Czech act in English that one of the ‘fan-favourites‘ didn’t win.</p>
<p>The singer received little digs and sly comments. Phrases used repeatedly and permeating in different fandom circles. Some designed to delegitimise his music or dismiss his vast performing experience. Other, equally ignorant comments dismissing his contribution to the contest. Some directly targeted at his identity. Allusions and racist tropes which aim to dehumanise his existence.</p>
<p>Statements that allude to the fact the singer is somehow not ‘European‘ or even how ‘that style of music‘ doesn’t belong to the song contest. More brazenly, how this isn’t the ‘Africavision‘. You don’t need to be subject to similar abuse to know where these comments are coming from…</p>
<p>Now, I could take the time to call out or challenge the motives behind these comments. All three claims are different shades of racist. But to call these claims out, especially on social media platforms, creates a ‘debate’-style format. However, you aren’t debating a slogan or a staging concept… instead the legitimacy of somebody’s existence.</p>
<p>As a person of colour, a part of me hesitates to do anything. I’m all too aware that if someone feels comfortable Othering a section of society, it doesn’t usually take a huge amount to widen the metaphoric net of prejudice. However, to say nothing is to be complicit and watch those views be legitimised: further erasing any resistance to a bubbling systemic racism within the fandom. Allies need to prevent bigotry from getting a platform.</p>
<p>racism is far from over Benny Cristo</p>
<p>Concluding thoughts</p>
<p>As much as we like to think the fandom is a homogenous blob of inclusivity, recent experience has proven it is not. To some, black lives are up for ‘debate’. Spoiler: they really are not.</p>
<p>I’m sure to some, this lengthy commentary is just as ‘ridiculous‘ as fans rightfully calling out editorial violence. Yet to fans who are black or people or colour more broadly, the fandom has become (or always was?) a hostile space. From a personal perspective, I have never felt more angry, isolated and ostracised by parts of the fandom whose statements in recent weeks and months have shocked me. ‘Celebrate Diversity‘ perfectly encapsulates the grand fissures between solidarity and inclusivity that comes with being an ally vs. the chasms of what is too often the reality: intolerance, ignorance and tokenism. However, I’m sure I am not the only one who has experienced this of late. There is a lot of work to be done to correct course, seal this chasm and make meaningful, positive steps forward.</p>
<p>This has been an incredibly painful few weeks…</p>

<h3 id="the-masked-singer-tony-hawk-removes-elephant-mask-after-singing-the-cure-song-and-stumping-panel">&ldquo;The Masked Singer: Tony Hawk removes Elephant mask after singing The Cure song and stumping panel&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/20/05/24964614-0-image-a-53_1582177294618.jpg" alt="img">
Pro skateboarder Tony Hawk was revealed to be the Elephant on Wednesday&rsquo;s episode of The Masked Singer on Fox.</p>
<p>The legendary athlete, who&rsquo;d won more than 70 skateboarding contests in his 17-year career, first turned in an impressive cover of The Cure&rsquo;s Friday I&rsquo;m In Love.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I chose the Cure because it&rsquo;s a deep connection between my wife and I, and we chose a Cure song for our wedding song,&rsquo; Tony, 51, explained referencing his fourth wife Cathy Goodman.</p>
<p>Mask off: Pro skateboarder Tony Hawk was revealed to be the Elephant on Wednesday&rsquo;s episode of The Masked Singer on Fox</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t enough to help him win the show&rsquo;s competition, though he didn&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had one more song in me, but I didn&rsquo;t want to go much further, so thank you for releasing me,&rsquo; Tony said, as the judges laughed.</p>
<p>The skateboarder was the first to be cut from Group B&rsquo;s six-singer team, all of whom were vying for a spot in the show&rsquo;s finale.</p>
<p>Tony was lucky that the judging panel hadn&rsquo;t immediately guessed who he was, given how close they came with their suspicions.</p>
<p>Impressive cover: The 51-year-old legendary athlete, who&rsquo;d won more than 70 skateboarding contests in his 17-year career, turned in an impressive cover of The Cure&rsquo;s Friday I&rsquo;m In Love</p>
<p>June wedding: The skateboarder shared a wedding photo in June 2015 on Twitter showing him kissing bride Cathy Goodman during their ceremony at Adare Manor in Ireland</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there had been a skateboard anywhere, I would have gone with Tony Hawk!&rsquo; cried judge Robin Thicke, 42, after Tony unmasked.</p>
<p>Robin had sensed the Elephant&rsquo;s profession from the minute he saw the character&rsquo;s neon outfit, saying, &lsquo;The outfit is very young and athletic, like extreme sports.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or like, skateboarder,&rsquo; added Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, 47, nearly nailing it.</p>
<p>Extreme sports: Robin Thicke believed the singer was involved in extreme sports</p>
<p>So close: Jenny McCarthy thought it could be a skateboarder</p>
<p>Robin suggested that the Elephant might be motorsports champion Travis Pastrana, 36, while Jenny thought it could be biker and cancer-research advocate Lance Armstrong, 48.</p>
<p>Judge Nicole Scherzinger, 41, guessed it was her &lsquo;buddy&rsquo; DJ Steve Aoki, 42, whose new album is Neon Future, while judge Ken Jeong, 50, voted for politician-drummer Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, 47.</p>
<p>Jenny praised Tony&rsquo;s singing and dance moves, accurately describing his character, too.</p>
<p>Wild guesses: Jenny thought Elephant could be biker and cancer-research advocate Lance Armstrong, 48, while Robin suggested motorsports champion Travis Pastrana, 36, while Ken Jeong, 50, voted for politician-drummer Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, 47, and Nicole Scherzinger, 41, guessed it was her &lsquo;buddy&rsquo; DJ Steve Aoki, 42, whose new album is Neon Future</p>
<p>Nice try: Nicole was stumped by the Elephant along with her fellow panelists</p>
<p>Politically incorrect: Ken stood by his guess that Elephant was failed presidential candidate Beto</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know, watching your performance, I felt like you were courageous, you were brave,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;This might not be something where you have musical albums out there, but your performance made me feel like I could have the confidence to maybe do that someday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his video package, Tony spoke of &lsquo;how I became the biggest animal in the kingdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was a calf when I found my calling, and with hard work turned my passion into a one-man show,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I went from canvassing park benches to leading the charge of a massive movement, even parading through white houses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The host: Nick Cannon stood next to the Elephant as clues were offered</p>
<p>The reference to &lsquo;white houses&rsquo; turned out to be the White House, which Tony skated through during a Father&rsquo;s Day event in 2010 during the Obama administration, while the mention of park benches was a nod to his childhood skating in the parks of San Diego.</p>
<p>Visual clues included a drumset, a bicycle poster, a man doing a cartwheel, a golden crown, and a bluebird, which played on Tony&rsquo;s name and his skateboard company, Birdhouse.</p>
<p>The first singer to perform on Wednesday&rsquo;s show was Frog, a man of short stature who arrived dressed in a purple zoot suit, and said he &lsquo;came here to win it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unmasked singer: Tony performed one more time with his Elephant mask off</p>
<p>First up: Frog was the first to perform during season three of the hit Fox show</p>
<p>His confident version of MC Hammer&rsquo;s U Can&rsquo;t Touch This got the crowd rocking, and his dancing showed signs of professional training.</p>
<p>In his video, the Frog said that his &lsquo;metamorphosis&rsquo; had been &lsquo;anything but typical.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I leapt to stardom as fast as a lightning bolt,&rsquo; he recalled. &lsquo;Never had a chance to evolve my image and do things my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dance moves: The amphibian showed off some impressive dance moves</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was slithering with the big frogs from jump-jump; just had to fit in and survive,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;Showing this new side gives me butterflies in my stomach, but I&rsquo;m ready to drop the hammer and sing my face off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Clues to his identity included a poster of the 1996 Olympic games, hush puppy leftovers, a thumbs-up, $106 in cash, and a radio microphone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Man, that was &lsquo;te-ribbit,&rsquo; Robin joked after he sang. &lsquo;No, no, &lsquo;froget&rsquo; about it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not sure: The panelists were divided about the singer&rsquo;s identity</p>
<p>&lsquo;You killed the dance moves, you killed the rap, you brought your own flavor to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jenny thought the &lsquo;Olympics&rsquo; clue pointed to sprinter Michael Johnson, 52, while Ken felt it was track-and-field star Carl Lewis, 58, and Nicole and Robin thought it was singer Ray J, 39.</p>
<p>Up next was the Kitty, who came dressed in a Paris showgirl costume and belted out a sexy rendition of Ariana Grande&rsquo;s Dangerous Woman.</p>
<p>Showgirl costume: Kitty performed in a Paris showgirl costume</p>
<p>&lsquo;In all my wildest dreams, I never imagined I&rsquo;d be here, where I feel at home among the weird and the wonderful,&rsquo; she said in her video. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s almost like this show was made for me—a little bit of heaven, where I can wipe the slate clean as the purest snow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes it feels lonely because people don&rsquo;t think of me as the person I&rsquo;ve become, but the person I once was,&rsquo; she continued.</p>
<p>Visual clues included ballet dancers, a carafe of cream, a man looking through a telescope at the moon, scenes from old movies and stage shows, and a shattered rose.</p>
<p>Nailed it: The feline nailed her rendition of Dangerous Woman by Ariana Grande</p>
<p>The Kitty&rsquo;s performance was so strong that the crowd rose to its feet and the judges mouthed &lsquo;Oh my God,&rsquo; the moment they heard her sing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think she&rsquo;s already a fan favorite,&rsquo; Robin said when she finished. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s really no other character like her on this season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am being somebody that nobody has ever seen before, and it&rsquo;s always been inside of me, so it&rsquo;s great!&rsquo; the Kitty shared.</p>
<p>Fan favorite: Robin labeled Kitty as an early fan favorite in season three</p>
<p>Guesses included singer and dancer Julianne Hough, 31, singer and DJ Paris Hilton, 39, and reality star Nicole Richie, 38.</p>
<p>The next performer, Taco, came to the stage with so much funky verve, Nicole called out, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Taco Time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His version of Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s Fly Me To The Moon wowed the judges, who swayed as he sang.</p>
<p>Taco man: The next performer, Taco, came to the stage with so much funky verve, Nicole called out, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Taco Time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but that performance almost brought me to tears, it was so effortless,&rsquo; Nicole told him afterward.</p>
<p>From the way Taco moved, Jenny immediately sensed that he was older, and the man confirmed that in his video package, saying he had been a part of viewers&rsquo; lives &lsquo;for decades.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got plenty of seasoning, but my routine can get a bit mild,&rsquo; he hinted. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m here to bust out the buffet and spice things up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Smooth voice: Taco&rsquo;s version of Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s Fly Me To The Moon wowed the judges, who swayed as he sang</p>
<p>Visual clues to his identity included VHS tapes, an anchor, a Rubik&rsquo;s cube, and a trolley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the first time, I feel invisible,&rsquo; the Taco joked in his gaudy outfit, and that sense of humor made Nicole guess he could be former talk-show host Regis Philbin, 88.</p>
<p>Ken and Robin picked comedians Martin Short, 69, and Bob Saget, 63.</p>
<p>Funny guys: Nicole guessed that Taco could be Regis Philbin, while Ken and Robin picked comedians Martin Short, 69, and Bob Saget, 63</p>
<p>The Mouse swanned onto the stage next, wearing an elaborate flowered dress, and the judges immediately noticed that she was &lsquo;a tiny little thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her smooth, seasoned vocals on Oleta Adams&rsquo; Get Here had the crowd on its feet again.</p>
<p>They applauded her even more afterward when she called herself &lsquo;a chatterbox,&rsquo; noting that she wasn&rsquo;t allowed &lsquo;to say anything to anybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mighty mouse: The Mouse swanned onto the stage next, wearing an elaborate flowered dress, and the judges immediately noticed that she was &lsquo;a tiny little thing&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just like a mouse, I&rsquo;m small and cute,&rsquo; the Mouse detailed in her video, as she was shown on a football field. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t let my size fool you. Because my presence is larger than life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a leader in my field,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Really. I wrote the playbook. But as much as I love calling the shots and showing everyone who&rsquo;s boss, I also love having a walk-on role to play.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Visual clues for the Mouse included a pink tutu, a dry-erase board marked &lsquo;Bang Bang Formation,&rsquo; the words &lsquo;Warriors 1979,&rsquo; and gold pom-poms, which nodded to her comment that &lsquo;I never accept anything less than gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Crowd pleasing: The rodent&rsquo;s smooth, seasoned vocals on Oleta Adams&rsquo; Get Here had the crowd on its feet</p>
<p>Nicole thought it could be singer Darlene Love, 78, who had a &lsquo;legendary&rsquo; voice, while Robin suspected it was Dionne Warwick, 79, and Ken chose comedian Maya Rudolph, 47.</p>
<p>Last up was Banana, who confidently beat his chest as he made his entrance, making Nicole think he had &lsquo;done this before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His yellow jumpsuit and swagger recalled Elvis Presley, so his cover of the King&rsquo;s A Little Less Conversation was a perfect match.</p>
<p>Bold entrance: Last up was Banana, who confidently beat his chest as he made his entrance</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is what the show is all about!&rsquo; Ken cheered after Banana finished his performance.</p>
<p>In his video package, Banana acted like he was hungover, saying, &lsquo;Oh no! I&rsquo;m late for the stage! I can&rsquo;t believe I overdid it last night! You&rsquo;d think this was my first rodeo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m the Banana because I&rsquo;m tough on the outside, but a total smoothie on the inside. And a hoot to have at parties. Am I right, ladies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rocking out: Banana&rsquo;s yellow jumpsuit and swagger recalled Elvis Presley, so his cover of the King&rsquo;s A Little Less Conversation was a perfect match</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to peel back my layers and show I can use my voice in any environment. I just wanna see a smile!,&rsquo; Banana added.</p>
<p>His clues included a cowboy hat, various fruits, women in green costumes, and a blue collar.</p>
<p>The last reference had Jenny thinking of the popular Blue Collar Comedy Tour, and participating comedian Bill Engvall, 62, who wears a cowboy hat.</p>
<p>Fun song: The crowd swayed along with Banana during his performance</p>
<p>Nicole picked The Hangover actor Ed Helms, 46, while Robin thought it was Darius Rucker, 53.</p>
<p>Either way, Robin offered, &lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s a lot more to come for the Banana.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Masked Singer will return next week on Fox.</p>
<p>Lot more: Robin predicted that viewers would be hearing more from Banana
