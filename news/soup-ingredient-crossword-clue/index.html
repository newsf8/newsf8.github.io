<p>One way to attract attention to a dish is to give it a compelling name — something intriguing that makes you wonder why it was given that handle and makes you want to try it, simply out of curiosity.</p>
<p>One dish that has met those criteria for more than two centuries is mulligatawny soup. For English-only speakers, its name certainly doesn’t offer any clues as to what it contains.</p>
<p>article continues below</p>
<p>But “mulligatawny” does sound exotic. And when people who have never heard of it see it on a menu, it becomes a conversation starter: “What the heck is mulligatawny soup?”</p>
<p>According to An A-Z of Food and Drink, this South Indian creation first entered British cuisine at the end of the 18th century, thanks to employees of the East India Company.</p>
<p>When folks working for that company returned home to Britain, they brought with them techniques for making dishes they enjoyed in India. One of those Anglo-Indian dishes was mulligatawny soup.</p>
<p>Mulligatawny is derived from the Tamil word “milakutanni,” a compound of milaku, which means pepper, and tanni, which means water.</p>
<p>If you call something “pepper water,” it’s a good indication it’s going to be spicy hot.</p>
<p>However, when the soup made its way to Britain, as with other Anglo-Indian dishes, it was made with ingredients available there, such as commercial curry powder, and had little resemblance to the South Indian original.</p>
<p>It must have been delicious, though, because people in many parts of the world are still enjoying pots of mulligatawny soup and it continues to appear on restaurant menus.</p>
<p>According to the Oxford Companion to Food, mulligatawny soup started off as a pretty basic preparation made with ingredients such as chicken or mutton, fried onion, curry powder and stock or water.</p>
<p>But over the years, the book notes, the simple concept of pepper water has been greatly elaborated in some recipes, with many now using dozens of ingredients. That explains why it’s hard to find two mulligatawny soup recipes that are the same.</p>
<p>For example, some recipes are spicy hot, while others are milder. Some versions of the soup are chunky, while others are blended until smooth. Some only call for onion; others use myriad vegetables. And most contain rice, but others also mix in lentils.</p>
<p>The style of mulligatawny soup I make is an adapted version of a flavourful one I learned at culinary school decades ago. It’s rich with bits of simmered chicken, curry powder, vegetables, diced apple, ginger and coconut milk.</p>
<p>It’s also hearty, filling and comforting and perfect to enjoy on a cool November day.</p>
<p>My recipe yields six servings. If that’s too many for you, any that’s left over will freeze well.</p>
<p>Eric’s Mulligatawny Soup</p>
<p>This hearty version of the classic soup is filling enough to be lunch or dinner, especially when served with papadams or naan bread.</p>
<p>Preparation time: 45 minutes</p>
<p>Cooking time: About 90 minutes</p>
<p>Makes: Six (about 1 1/2 cups each) servings</p>
<p>4 cups chicken broth (see Note 1)</p>
<p>3 bone-in chicken thighs (about 500 grams)</p>
<p>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</p>
<p>1/2 cup diced onion (about 1/2 medium onion, see Note 2)</p>
<p>1/2 cup diced carrot (about 1 small carrot)</p>
<p>1/2 cup diced celery rib (about 1 medium stalk)</p>
<p>1/2 cup diced red bell pepper (about 1/2 medium pepper)</p>
<p>1 to 2 large garlic cloves, minced</p>
<p>1 tsp finely grated, peeled fresh ginger</p>
<p>1 Tbsp medium curry powder (see Note 3)</p>
<p>1 (14 oz./398 mL) can coconut milk</p>
<p>2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice</p>
<p>1 Tbsp honey</p>
<p>1 medium, unpeeled green apple, cored and diced</p>
<p>2 Tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup water</p>
<p>1 cup cold, cooked white or brown basmati rice</p>
<p>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or thinly sliced green onion</p>
<p>• salt to taste</p>
<p>Place the broth in a tall, narrow pot. Add the chicken thighs, then set over medium-high heat. Bring broth to a gentle simmer (small bubbles should just break on the surface). Lower heat as needed to maintain that gentle simmer.</p>
<p>Simmer, uncovered, 50 to 60 minutes, or until the chicken thighs are cooked through and the meat is tender and almost falling off the bone.</p>
<p>Remove pot from the heat. Use a slotted spoon to lift the thighs out of the pot and onto a plate. Cool thighs to room temperature.</p>
<p>Now remove and discard the skin and bones from the thighs. Dice the meat, set back on the plate, cover and refrigerate until needed for the soup.</p>
<p>Measure the broth in the pot. You should have at least three cups. If not, top it up with water until you do.</p>
<p>To make the soup, place the oil in a medium-to-large pot set over medium to medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add onion, carrot, celery and bell pepper and cook until tender, about five minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and curry powder and cook and stir two minutes more.</p>
<p>Pour the chicken thigh cooking broth into the pot. Add the coconut milk, juice, honey, apples, cornstarch/water mixture and diced, cooked chicken. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer, reducing the heat as needed to maintain that gentle simmer.</p>
<p>Simmer soup 15 to 20 minutes. Mix in the rice and let it heat through a few minutes. Mix in the cilantro (or sliced green onion), taste and season soup with salt, and it’s ready to serve.</p>
<p>Note 1: If using store-bought broth, because one cup equals about 237 millilitres, one 900-millilitre container will yield the four cups.</p>
<p>Note 2: Diced in this recipe means to cut into 1/4-inch cubes.</p>
<p>Note 3: Medium curry powder is sold in jars at most supermarkets. It gave the soup a mild to medium spice level. If you prefer a very mild-tasting soup, use regular curry powder. If you like things spicy, use hot curry powder.</p>
<p>Eric’s options: For added texture and taste, serve the soup with bowls of toasted, unsweetened coconut flakes, and/or sliced, toasted almonds. Sprinkle the toppings on the soup, to taste, at the dinner table.</p>

<h3 id="the-compilers-arsenal-our-final-set-of-tips-for-solving-cryptic-crosswords-from-our-puzzles-editor">&ldquo;The compiler&rsquo;s arsenal: our final set of tips for solving cryptic crosswords from our puzzles editor&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/family/2020/04/17/TELEMMGLPICT000229275514-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2HnVwLkbcGFt-HBC0aRiBAvvK2zlC7cjlBtvEaXm0Gg.jpeg?imwidth=1200" alt="img">
We may also need to reverse a word to give part of a charade. For instance:</p>
<p>Food with wine turning up is soup (7)</p>
<p>Another word for “food” is CHOW; a type of wine is RED; if we reverse this (or “turn it up”), we get CHOW + DER, which gives CHOWDER – a type of soup. It’s worth adding that reversal indicators such as “up” are only normally used in down clues.</p>
<p>Backwards testing</p>
<p>Try the following reversal clues (the answers are at the bottom of the page); in each case we’ve given some letters of the answer:</p>
<p>1 Artist returned to get prize (6) R _ W _ R _</p>
<p>2 Fool can upset with humour (6)N _ T _ I _</p>
<p>3 Turning, hit friends (4) P _ L _</p>
<p>4 Boast about getting something to wear (4) G _ R _</p>
<p>Substitutions</p>
<p>Another type of clue you might see is a substitution clue. As the name suggests, this is where one part of a word is replaced with another in order to come up with the answer. Here is an example:</p>
<p>Get up with daughter, not son, and travel (4)</p>
<p>The presence of “with … not … “ alerts us to the possibility that we may be looking at a clue where we need to one substitute one thing for another. “Daughter” often gives the single letter D, which is an abbreviation, and “son” often gives the letter S. A word that means “get up” is RISE; if we substitute D for S then we have RIDE, which means “travel”.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may be that we are asked to replace a letter or letters in a particular place in the clue:</p>
<p>Cook’s note to replace second piece of Spam (5)</p>
<p>Again, we are being asked to replace one thing with another. The second piece of Spam is its second letter, P. If we replace this with the note TE (the seventh note in sol-fa notation), we have STEAM, which can mean “cook”.</p>
<p>Substitute testing</p>
<p>Try the following substitution clues; again, we’ve given some letters to get you started:</p>
<p>1 Huge area for one in written communication (7) M _ S _ I _ E</p>
<p>2 Cut number with right to replace dean, ultimately (5) S _ V _ R</p>
<p>3 Tougher prison guard swaps wife for husband (5) H _ R _ E _</p>
<p>I need more help!</p>
<p>Once you understand how cryptic crossword clues work, if you are still finding things difficult, then practice makes perfect. The Telegraph Crossword is published in the newspaper and online every day (other than on Christmas Day, when it appears online only); an archive of all of the crosswords that have appeared since 2007 or so is available on the Telegraph Puzzles website.</p>
<p>Everybody comes to cryptic crosswords in a different way. Some people are born in houses where parents or siblings routinely solve them, and so pick them up by osmosis. Other people have friends or relatives who are solvers and who sit down to show them how cryptic crosswords work.</p>
<p>For many budding solvers, however, it’s a case of trying to fathom them out without any input from others.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to do this is by trying to solve clues in a puzzle, then looking at the answers when they are published the following day. This is a good way of seeing the clues, seeing the answers, and so being able to work out how the answer was arrived at.</p>
<p>If practice isn’t enough, however, there is further help at hand, particularly online; it’s simply a question of knowing where it is.

<h3 id="whats-really-in-your-pack-of-instant-noodles">&ldquo;What’s really in your pack of instant noodles?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4007567&amp;origw=1440" alt="img">
Instant noodles saved my life. Or to put it less succinctly, eating instant noodles allowed me to spend what little money I had on travel and a roof over my head rather than food when backpacking in Asia.</p>
<p>Each plastic package of pasta with its own soup mix was just the right size for one person. They are extremely cheap and simple to prepare with a little hot water. Add some grated cheese and you have a meal in about three minutes.</p>
<p>Not the healthiest meal perhaps, but one that fills a gap.</p>
<p>The cost doesn’t seem to have increased much over the years, which may be why they still appeal to hungry students. The cheapest packet I found was the Hearty Food Co’s Chicken Flavour Noodles. It cost just 10c, though the average price of noodles is closer to €1. One clue as to why they are so cheap is in the name: chicken flavour noodles. There’s no chicken, no chicken fat, no chicken extract, just flavouring. That means this Tesco own brand can stamp the product “suitable for vegans”.</p>
<p>So what else can we learn from the packet?</p>
<p>There may not be any chicken in this dish, but there is sugar and it’s in the noodles, not just in the sauce as you might expect. The noodles are made up of wheat flour, palm oil, salt (salt, potassium iodate), sugar, garlic powder and guar gum. Potassium iodate is a form of iodine, which is added to salt in some countries, such as China and the United States, to prevent a deficiency. There is iodine in milk here, so there is seen to be no need to supplement. Generally noodles are made of wheat flour, egg and water. So there should be no need for the extras here.</p>
<p>The other ingredients are there to make up the chicken-flavoured soup mix. These include maltodextrin, yeast extract, onion powder, turmeric powder, carrot powder, garlic powder, palm oil, coriander, flavouring, white pepper, caramel for colour, ginger powder, cumin and more sugar. The yeast extract and flavouring will help to create the flavour of bird flesh. As soupy mixes go, this isn’t the worst but I still take the advice I was given in China: eat the noodles, but don’t drink the soup.</p>
<p>Aldi’s chicken flavour instant noodles have a green logo indicating they are fine for vegetarians as there is no chicken involved here either. The noodles are of the same composition as those from Tesco’s Hearty Food brand, but the soup mix has more additives including disodium 5’-ribonucleotides, milk powder and citric acid. Pass.</p>
<p>Koka Chicken Noodles, which are distributed by Boyne Valley, are more appetising. The noodles are made in Singapore from wheat flour, palm oil and salt. These are among the best instant noodles I found. The soup mix, however, is mainly salt and has no chicken. It does have chicken flavouring, with added wheat and soya, flavour enhancer number E621, which is monosodium glutamate (MSG), sugar, hydrolysed soy protein, chives and spices. Some people who have a reaction to MSG also react badly to hydrolysed soy protein, which is also a flavour enhancer. So, don’t drink the soup but do eat the noodles.</p>
<p>Don’t expect to find beef in the beef flavoured dishes either. Batchelors BBQ beef flavour super noodles get their meaty taste thanks to unidentified “flavouring”, yeast extract, monosodium glutamate, disodium 5’-ribonucleotides, smoked dextrose, smoke flavourings, black pepper, onion, parsley and thyme extract.</p>
<p>If that’s not off-putting enough, in addition to wheat flour and oil, the noodles are made up of butylated hydroxyanisole, citric acid and propyl gallate. Butylated hydroxyanisole is used to stop oil from going rancid. Early studies showed it caused tumours in hamsters, so don’t give it to any pets. Propyl gallate is another antioxidant. There are better products out there.</p>
<p>The noodles in McDonnells Sizzling BBQ Steak Flavour packet contain potato starch as well as wheat flour, palm oil, salt and raising agents. That seems appropriate for an Irish brand owned by the Boyne Valley group. There is no steak involved but the soup mix has a variety of the usual flavour enhancers, sugar, flavourings, colours, additives and preservatives.</p>
<p>The best place to get the real flavour of the East is to pick up some noodles in an oriental shop such as the Asia Market in Dublin. Nissan’s Five-spice beef flavour noodles, for example, are made with enough E numbers to delight an accountant, as is the soup mix. But they do have real beef extract too, which helps with the flavour. Just don’t drink the soup.</p>

Few topics are as loaded as a discussion about gumbo in New Orleans. Believed to be based on West African soups, such as Senegal’s soupikandia, gumbo has no clear, indisputable lineage. Historians will tell you that’s because West African slaves, thought to have created gumbo in New Orleans in the 18th century, relied on oral traditions to pass along recipes, leaving behind no evidence of their efforts.</p>
<p>The word “gumbo” is considered a corruption of “tchingombo” and “ochingombo,” a pair of terms that mean “okra” in the Bantu family of languages. The word associations lead some historians to argue that okra is the foundation for gumbo, period. But this narrative is complicated by those who point out that gumbo may have taken its name from the word “kombo,” the Choctaw Nation term for powdered sassafras leaves, another common thickener. Or that French and Cajun cultures have also had a hand in the formulation of this famous soup.</p>
<p>No writer or historian has turned up evidence to suggest the Cajuns, French or Choctaw were the first to prepare gumbo in New Orleans. Yet, each of these groups has left its mark on a soup that, in all likelihood, was lifted from Africa and became one of the city’s most iconic dishes, one flexible enough to absorb the influences of so many cultures.

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/15/world/15asia-promo/15asia8-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
The grim forecast in its 2020 World Economic Outlook is an extraordinary reversal from January, when the I.M.F. predicted moderate growth at 3.3 percent. The revised forecast takes into account disrupted supply chains and sustained standstills in industries like tourism.</p>
<p>“The world has been put in a Great Lockdown,” said Gita Gopinath, the fund’s chief economist. “The magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed is unlike anything experienced in our lifetimes.”</p>
<p>Though it predicted a partial rebound next year, the fund said there was still a chance the outcome could be even worse. This year’s decline in output, the I.M.F. predicts, would be worse than that of the 2008 recession, when the economy contracted by less than 1 percent, but less severe than that of the Great Depression, when output contracted by 10 percent.</p>
<p>In context: In this best-case scenario, the world would lose a cumulative $9 trillion in output over two years — greater than the combined gross domestic products of Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>Markets: The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 3 percent, after upticks in European and Asian markets, as investors saw signs that outbreaks were peaking and businesses slowly reawakening.

<h3 id="packaged-foods-breach-safe-limits-of-salt-fat-cse-study">&ldquo;Packaged foods breach safe limits of salt, fat: CSE study&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cyyahd/article16898113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THFOOD" alt="img">
An array of packaged snacks and fast foods breach safe limits of salt and fat content, says a laboratory analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment.</p>
<p>The agency tested salt, fat, trans-fat and carbohydrates in 33 popular “junk foods”, which consisted of 14 samples of chips, salted snacks, instant noodles and instant soup, and 19 samples of burgers, fries, fried chicken, pizzas, sandwiches and wraps. The samples were collected from grocery stores and fast food outlets in the city.</p>
<p>Daily ceiling</p>
<p>To calculate how unsafe the foods tested were, the organisation relied on the concept of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) — a daily ceiling on the amount of salt, fat, carbohydrates and transfats. The RDA is based on scientific consensus and has been agreed upon by expert bodies such as the World Health Organisation, and the National Institute of Nutrition in India. It says that, ideally, no more than 5 gm of salt, 60 gm of fat, 300 gm carbohydrate and 2.2 gm of transfat should be consumed by an adult every day. Further, the RDA from each breakfast, lunch and dinner should be no more than 25%, and that from snacks no more than 10%.</p>
<p>The CSE found that given the size of the servings and the amount of nutrients per 100 gm, a single packet of packaged nuts, soup or noodles ended up having these salts and fats well over the recommended limits. For instance, Haldiram Aloo Bhujia, a popular savoury snack, with a serve size of 231 gm, had the equivalent of 7 gm of salt and 99 gm of total (saturated and unsaturated) fat. A single serving of the Nestle’s Maggi Masala (70 gm) exhausted 50% of the composite RDA for a snack, and a serving of Haldiram’s nut cracker exhausted 35% of the salt RDA and 26% of the fat RDA, the CSE analysis found.</p>
<p>Need to declare</p>
<p>According to the proposed draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, packaged food companies will need to declare nutritional information such as calories (energy), saturated fat, trans-fat, added sugar and sodium per serve on the front of the pack. The food labels are also required to declare, per serve percentage contribution to RDA on the front of the pack. Though under discussions since 2015 and several drafts — the latest one came out in in July — these rules have yet to become law, and to be operationalised.</p>
<p>‘Red Octagon’</p>
<p>The CSE took the values prescribed in the drafts for their calculations and concluded that all of the popular snacks and fast foods ought to be displaying a ‘Red Octagon’, a warning symbol employed in packaged foods in Chile and Peru. The Red Octagon, which should be printed on the front of the pack, has a number and the name of the food component within that indicates how widely off the RDA a particular ingredient is. Thus a Red “3.1, Salt” on a pack of Lay’s India’s Magic Masala by PepsiCo indicates that the salt it contains is 3.1 times the RDA for snacks.</p>
<p>“What we have seen is that all of the packaged foods of the various brands we tested would be in the red. This is why the powerful food industry is opposing the notification,” said Sunita Narain, director general of CSE, at a press conference. The regulations, as they now stand, don’t apply to fast foods such as burgers and pizzas, even though they were included in the CSE analysis.

<p>A new coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, that has claimed 17 lives may have been transmitted to people from snakes, according to a genetic analysis. The snakes may have caught the virus from bats in the food market in which both animals were sold.</p>
<p>As of 22 January, there are 555 confirmed cases of the infection, which can cause fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia. To contain the virus, Wuhan has effectively been placed under quarantine, with public transport being temporarily closed, according to reports.</p>
<p>While 444 of the cases have been reported in Wuhan, others have also been confirmed in the surrounding regions of China, with 26 in Guangdong province, 14 in Beijing and 9 in Shanghai. Internationally, confirmed cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the US. Hundreds more are suspected, and attempts to diagnose these cases are under way.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The source of the infection is suspected to be a food market in Wuhan that was visited by several of those first infected with the virus. The market is known to sell live wild and farmed animals, including marmots, birds, rabbits, bats and snakes.</p>
<p>To find out if the virus might have come from one of these animals, Wei Ji and colleagues at Peking University in China compared the genomes of five samples of the new virus with 217 similar viruses collected from a range of species.</p>
<p>Their analysis suggests that the new virus looks similar to those found in bats, but is most like viruses seen in snakes, genetically speaking. “Results derived from our sequence analysis suggest for the first time that snake is the most likely wildlife animal reservoir,” they wrote.</p>
<p>“We are excited about this new speculation,” says Haitao Guo at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, who reviewed the study. “We need more experimental evidence, but it gives us a clue,” he says.</p>
<p>The new virus may have formed as a result of viruses from bats and snakes combining, which can happen when two types of animal are kept in close quarters, as can happen in food markets, says Peter Rabinowitz at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>

<p>The virus may then have passed to people through the air, says Rabinowitz. “It’s still speculation, but if the virus is in the secretions or faeces of the snakes, it would be possible to aerosolise and be breathed in if there were enough snakes and enough people,” he says.</p>
<p>On 22 January, the World Health Organization held an emergency committee on the new virus, which is in the same family as SARS and MERS. Following the meeting, director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that he needed more information on the virus and its spread before he could declare the outbreak a public health emergency.</p>
<p>“This is an evolving and complex situation,” said Ghebreyesus. “The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously, and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence.”</p>
<p>The emergency committee will meet again tomorrow, and Ghebreyesus promises they “will have much more to say” then.</p>
