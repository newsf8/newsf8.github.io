Angelina Jolie writes powerful essay about how two of her daughters have had surgery By Heather Cichowski

Angelina Jolie is no stranger to being honest and very open about medical issues. In 2013, she revealed she'd had a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had a very high risk of developing breast cancer due to a particular gene. Now, she's opened up about different medical issues her daughters have faced.

In honour of International Women's Day, the activist and actress has penned a touching essay for Time in which she revealed two of her children have had surgery. In the personal piece, entitled "Why Girls Deserve Love and Respect on International Women's Day," she picked up her pen in the hospital to write about how her family coped with the operations and the girls' recoveries.

"They know that I am writing this, because I respect their privacy and we discussed it together and they encouraged me to write," she stated.

"They understand that going through medical challenges and fighting to survive and heal is something to be proud of."

The Oscar-winner has six children with former partner Brad Pitt: Maddox, 18, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 13, Vivienne, 11, and Knox, 11.

While Angelina didn't use names in the piece, she wrote that her eldest daughter (Zahara) has been "in and out of surgery" for the last two months and also said her younger daughter (Shiloh) had hip surgery. Recent pictures that have emerged online show Shiloh on crutches after the operation Angelina mentioned.

In her piece, Angelina praised her children for rallying around each other during this difficult time.

"I saw how all my girls so easily stopped everything and put each other first, and felt the joy of being of service to those they love," she wrote.

The mom of six acknowledged the support her daughters received from her brothers, but said she is focused on the girls' perspective in honour of International Women's Day.

Angelina also used the moment to consider all the girls she has met around the world.

After hearing about how caring "comes naturally to girls," the American actress said she wanted to make sure this openness and instinct to help others is "appreciated and not abused." She encouraged society to do more to protect girls and closed her emotional essay with what she wanted people to take from her writing:

"My wish on this day is that we value girls. Care for them. And know that the stronger they grow, the healthier they will be and the more they will give back to their family and community."

Brad was also reportedly very involved in his daughters' surgeries. He was said to have missed the 2020 BAFTAs so he could be there for his children. According to Page Six, the Oscar-winning actor cited a "family obligation" at the time for his reason for not attending the awards ceremony in London.

We hope that Angelina and Brad's daughters make a speedy and healthy recovery.
